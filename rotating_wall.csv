rotating_wall,37662695,Technology using simulated microgravity.,"The human body experiences constant stimulation from Earth's gravity, and the absence of gravity leads to various impacts at the cellular and tissue levels. Simulated microgravity (s-μg) has been employed on Earth to investigate these effects, circumventing the challenges of conducting experiments in space and providing an opportunity to understand the influence of microgravity on living organisms. Research focusing on stem cells and utilizing s-μg has enhanced our understanding of how microgravity affects stem cell morphology, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Studies have used systems such as rotating wall vessels, random positioning machines, and clinostats. By uncovering the mechanisms underlying the observed changes in these studies, there is potential to identify therapeutic targets that regulate stem cell function and explore a range of applications, including stem cell-based regenerative medicine. This review will focus on the features of each device designed to simulate microgravity on Earth, as well as the stem cell experiments performed with those devices.

rotating_wall,32599028,The science of BAV aortopathy.,"The aortopathy associated with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is an epidemiologically relevant source of chronic and acute aortic disease (aneurysm and dissection). However, its pathogenesis is still the object of scientific uncertainties and debates. Indeed, the mechanisms determining the diseases of the ascending aorta in BAV patients are most likely complex and multifactorial, i.e. resulting from variable modes of interplay between genetic and hemodynamic factors. Although few scientific studies have so far taken into adequate account this complexity, leaving the precise sequence of pathogenetic events still undiscovered, the accumulated evidence from previous research approaches have at least brought about important insights. While genetic studies have so far identified variants relevant to either valve malformation or aortic complications (including those in the genes NOTCH1, TGFBR2, ACTA2, GATA5, NKX2.5, SMAD6, ROBO4), however each explaining not more than 5% of the study population, other investigations have thoroughly described both the flow features, with consequent forces acting on the arterial wall (including skewed flow jet direction, rotational flow, wall shear stress), and the main changes in the molecular and cellular wall structure (including extracellular matrix degradation, smooth muscle cell changes, oxidative stress, unbalance of TGF-β signaling, aberrant endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition). All of this evidence, together with the recognition of the diverse phenotypes that the aortopathy can assume in BAV patients, holding possible prognostic significance, is reviewed in this chapter. The complex and multifaceted body of knowledge resulting from clinical and basic science studies on BAV aortopathy has the potential to importantly influence modes of clinical management of this disease in the near future.",Lo Presti F; Guzzardi DG; Bancone C; Fedak PWM; Della Corte A,Aortopathy; Bicuspid aortic valve; Biomarkers; Flow patterns; Vessel wall remodeling,2020,Progress in cardiovascular diseases,Journal Article; Review,,
rotating_wall,12426749,[Anatomy and function of the anterior cruciate ligament].,"The anterior cruciate ligament originates at the medial wall of the lateral femoral condyle and inserts into the middle of the intercondylar area. It contributes significantly to the stabilization and kinematics of the knee joint. The femoral origin is oval and is located in the posterior aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. Therefore, it is difficult to visualize the femoral origin arthroscopically. This might be one reason for anterior malpositioning of the femoral bone tunnel during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The position of the femoral origin is behind the center of rotation of the knee joint; therefore, it becomes tense when the knee is extended. The tibial insertion is oval and its center is nearly in the middle of the tibial plateau. Definite landmarks for tibial tunnel placement in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction are the distance between the central insertion point at the intercondylar floor and the posterior cruciate ligament (7-8 mm) and the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus. The anterior cruciate ligament consists of multiple small fiber bundles. From a functional point of view, one can differentiate the anteromedial and posterolateral fiber bundles. The anteromedial fibers are tense during a greater range of motion than the posterolateral fibers. The main part of the anterior cruciate ligament consists of type I collagen-positive dense connective tissue. The longitudinal fibrils of type I collagen are divided into small bundles by thin type III collagen-positive fibrils. In the distal third, the structure of the tissue varies from the typical structure of a ligament. In this region, the structure of the tissue resembles fibrocartilage. Oval-shaped cells surrounded by a metachromatic extracellular matrix lie between the longitudinal collagen fibrils. The femoral origin and the tibial insertion have the structure of a chondral apophyseal enthesis. Near the anchoring region at the femur and tibia, there should be various mechanoreceptors, which might have an important function for the kinematics of the knee joint. The blood supply of the anterior cruciate ligament arises from the middle geniculate artery. The ligament is covered by a synovial fold where the terminal branches of the middle and the inferior geniculate artery form a periligamentous network. From the synovial sheath, the blood vessels penetrate the ligament in a horizontal direction and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network. The distribution of blood vessels within the anterior cruciate ligament is not homogeneous. We detected three avascular areas within the ligament: Both fibrocartilaginous entheses of the anterior cruciate ligament are devoid of blood vessels. A third avascular zone is located in the distal zone of fibrocartilage adjacent to the roof of the intercondylar fossa.",Petersen W; Tillmann B,,2002,Der Orthopade,English Abstract; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,11399642,Optimized suspension culture: the rotating-wall vessel.,"Suspension culture remains a popular modality, which manipulates mechanical culture conditions to maintain the specialized features of cultured cells. The rotating-wall vessel is a suspension culture vessel optimized to produce laminar flow and minimize the mechanical stresses on cell aggregates in culture. This review summarizes the engineering principles, which allow optimal suspension culture conditions to be established, and the boundary conditions, which limit this process. We suggest that to minimize mechanical damage and optimize differentiation of cultured cells, suspension culture should be performed in a solid-body rotation Couette-flow, zero-headspace culture vessel such as the rotating-wall vessel. This provides fluid dynamic operating principles characterized by 1) solid body rotation about a horizontal axis, characterized by colocalization of cells and aggregates of different sedimentation rates, optimally reduced fluid shear and turbulence, and three-dimensional spatial freedom; and 2) oxygenation by diffusion. Optimization of suspension culture is achieved by applying three tradeoffs. First, terminal velocity should be minimized by choosing microcarrier beads and culture media as close in density as possible. Next, rotation in the rotating-wall vessel induces both Coriolis and centrifugal forces, directly dependent on terminal velocity and minimized as terminal velocity is minimized. Last, mass transport of nutrients to a cell in suspension culture depends on both terminal velocity and diffusion of nutrients. In the transduction of mechanical culture conditions into cellular effects, several lines of evidence support a role for multiple molecular mechanisms. These include effects of shear stress, changes in cell cycle and cell death pathways, and upstream regulation of secondary messengers such as protein kinase C. The discipline of suspension culture needs a systematic analysis of the relationship between mechanical culture conditions and biological effects, emphasizing cellular processes important for the industrial production of biological pharmaceuticals and devices.",Hammond TG; Hammond JM,NASA Discipline Cell Biology; Non-NASA Center,2001,American journal of physiology.

rotating_wall,11865869,Clinostats and bioreactors.,"The environment created on Earth within a clinostat or Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor is often referred to as ""simulated microgravity"". Both devices utilize constant reorientation to effectively nullify cumulative sedimentation of particles. Neither, however, can fully reproduce the concurrent lack of structural deformation, displacement of intercellular components and/or reduced mass transfer in the extracellular fluid that occur in actual weightlessness. Parameters including density, viscosity, and even container geometry must each be considered to determine the overall gravity-dependent effects produced by either a clinostat or the RWV bioreactor; in addition, the intended application of these two devices differs considerably. A state of particle ""motionlessness"" relative to the surrounding bulk fluid, which is nearly analogous to the extracellular environment encountered under weightless conditions, can theoretically be achieved through clinorotation. The RWV bioreactor, on the other hand, while similarly maintaining cells in suspension as they continually ""fall"" through the medium under 1 g conditions, can also purposefully induce a perfusion of nutrients to and waste from the culture. A clinostat, therefore, is typically used in an attempt to reproduce the quiescent, unstirred fluid conditions achievable on orbit; while the RWV bioreactor ideally creates a low shear, but necessarily mixed, fluid environment that is optimized for suspension culture and tissue growth. Other techniques for exploring altered inertial environments, such as freefall, neutral buoyancy and electromagnetic levitation, can also provide unique insight into how gravity affects biological systems. Ultimately, all underlying biophysical principles thought to give rise to gravity-dependent physiological responses must be identified and thoroughly examined in order to accurately interpret data from flight experiments or ground-based microgravity analogs.",Klaus DM,,2001,Gravitational and space biology bulletin : publication of the American Society,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,20948552,Organotypic 3D cell culture models: using the rotating wall vessel to study host-pathogen interactions.,Appropriately simulating the three-dimensional (3D) environment in which tissues normally develop and function is crucial for engineering in vitro models that can be used for the meaningful dissection of host-pathogen interactions. This Review highlights how the rotating wall vessel bioreactor has been used to establish 3D hierarchical models that range in complexity from a single cell type to multicellular co-culture models that recapitulate the 3D architecture of tissues observed in vivo. The application of these models to the study of infectious diseases is discussed.,Barrila J; Radtke AL; Crabbé A; Sarker SF; Herbst-Kralovetz MM; Ott CM; Nickerson CA,,2010,Nature reviews.

rotating_wall,22491366,Culturing and applications of rotating wall vessel bioreactor derived 3D epithelial cell models.,"Cells and tissues in the body experience environmental conditions that influence their architecture, intercellular communications, and overall functions. For in vitro cell culture models to accurately mimic the tissue of interest, the growth environment of the culture is a critical aspect to consider. Commonly used conventional cell culture systems propagate epithelial cells on flat two-dimensional (2-D) impermeable surfaces. Although much has been learned from conventional cell culture systems, many findings are not reproducible in human clinical trials or tissue explants, potentially as a result of the lack of a physiologically relevant microenvironment. Here, we describe a culture system that overcomes many of the culture condition boundaries of 2-D cell cultures, by using the innovative rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology. We and others have shown that organotypic RWV-derived models can recapitulate structure, function, and authentic human responses to external stimuli similarly to human explant tissues (1-6). The RWV bioreactor is a suspension culture system that allows for the growth of epithelial cells under low physiological fluid shear conditions. The bioreactors come in two different formats, a high-aspect rotating vessel (HARV) or a slow-turning lateral vessel (STLV), in which they differ by their aeration source. Epithelial cells are added to the bioreactor of choice in combination with porous, collagen-coated microcarrier beads (Figure 1A). The cells utilize the beads as a growth scaffold during the constant free fall in the bioreactor (Figure 1B). The microenvironment provided by the bioreactor allows the cells to form three-dimensional (3-D) aggregates displaying in vivo-like characteristics often not observed under standard 2-D culture conditions (Figure 1D). These characteristics include tight junctions, mucus production, apical/basal orientation, in vivo protein localization, and additional epithelial cell-type specific properties. The progression from a monolayer of epithelial cells to a fully differentiated 3-D aggregate varies based on cell type(1, 7-13). Periodic sampling from the bioreactor allows for monitoring of epithelial aggregate formation, cellular differentiation markers and viability (Figure 1D). Once cellular differentiation and aggregate formation is established, the cells are harvested from the bioreactor, and similar assays performed on 2-D cells can be applied to the 3-D aggregates with a few considerations (Figure 1E-G). In this work, we describe detailed steps of how to culture 3-D epithelial cell aggregates in the RWV bioreactor system and a variety of potential assays and analyses that can be executed with the 3-D aggregates. These analyses include, but are not limited to, structural/morphological analysis (confocal, scanning and transmission electron microscopy), cytokine/chemokine secretion and cell signaling (cytometric bead array and Western blot analysis), gene expression analysis (real-time PCR), toxicological/drug analysis and host-pathogen interactions. The utilization of these assays set the foundation for more in-depth and expansive studies such as metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and other array-based applications. Our goal is to present a non-conventional means of culturing human epithelial cells to produce organotypic 3-D models that recapitulate the human in vivo tissue, in a facile and robust system to be used by researchers with diverse scientific interests.",Radtke AL; Herbst-Kralovetz MM,,2012,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Video-Audio Media",U19 AI062150/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; IU19 AI062150-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,28451812,Debulking Atherectomy in the Peripheral Arteries: Is There a Role and What is the Evidence?,"Traditional percutaneous balloon angioplasty and stent placement is based on mechanical plaque disruption and displacement within the arterial wall. On the contrary, transcatheter atherectomy achieves atherosclerotic plaque clearance by means of directional plaque excision or rotational plaque removal or laser plaque ablation. Debulking atherectomy may allow for a more uniform angioplasty result at lower pressures with consequently less vessel barotrauma and improved luminal gain, thereby decreasing the risk of plaque recoil and dissection that may require permanent metal stenting. It has been also argued that atherectomy may disrupt the calcium barrier and optimize drug transfer and delivery in case of drug-coated balloon applications. The authors discuss the various types of atherectomy devices available in clinical practice to date and critically appraise their mode of action as well as relevant published data in each case. Overall, amassed randomized and observational evidence indicates that percutaneous atherectomy of the femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal arteries may achieve high technical success rates and seems to lessen the frequency of bailout stenting, however, at the expense of increased risk of peri-procedural distal embolization. Long-term clinical outcomes reported to date do not support the superiority of percutaneous atherectomy over traditional balloon angioplasty and stent placement in terms of vessel patency or limb salvage. The combination of debulking atherectomy and drug-coated balloons has shown promise in early studies, especially in the treatment of more complex lesions. Unanswered questions and future perspectives of this continuously evolving endovascular technology as part of a broader treatment algorithm are discussed.",Katsanos K; Spiliopoulos S; Reppas L; Karnabatidis D,Amputation; Atherectomy; Atherosclerosis; Directional; Embolization; Laser; Patency; Plaque excision; Rotational,2017,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,Journal Article; Review,,
rotating_wall,27894584,Pre-expanded Internal Mammary Artery Perforator Flap.,"Internal mammary artery (IMA)-based pedicled perforator flaps can be used to reconstruct defects of the neck and anterior chest wall. Pre-expansion causes a possible delay phenomenon, improves flap survival, and decreases donor site morbidity. It also increases the area that can be covered. Pre-expanding can allow for perforator flaps that require a shorter arc of rotation. The pre-expanded internal mammary artery perforator (IMAP) flap is an excellent option for patients who have undergone multiple failed reconstructions and require large amounts of soft tissue while lacking other donor sites.",Wong S; Goggin JD; Webster ND; Saint-Cyr MH,IMAP; Internal mammary artery perforator flap; Pre-expansion; Tissue expansion,2017,Clinics in plastic surgery,Journal Article; Review,,
rotating_wall,8501130,Three-dimensional growth and differentiation of ovarian tumor cell line in high aspect rotating-wall vessel: morphologic and embryologic considerations.,"Cancer of the ovary is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancy. To understand better these aggressive tumors, the development of in vitro models to study human ovarian cancer is critical. However, the establishment of long-term cell lines has been difficult, due to the generalized poor survival of patient tumor cells grown in primary culture. Satisfactory culture systems for ovarian tumor cells have therefore been limited. To study cellular interactions involved in the growth and differentiation of these tumors, a cell line was established from a mixed müllerian tumor of the ovary. This cell line, designated LN1, was cultured on microcarrier beads in the high aspect rotating-wall vessel. The tumor cells grown in this vessel readily proliferated without a requirement for cocultivation with a supportive cell layer. Evaluation of cellular morphology by phase contrast light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of three-dimensional multicellular aggregates consisting of multiple cell-coated beads bridged together, as well as scattered aggregates of LN1 cells proliferating as spheroids free in suspension. In contrast to conventional culture systems, culture in the high aspect rotating-wall vessel facilitated the generation of multiple cell types that could be recovered. These results illustrate the ability of this culture system to provide the biological conditions necessary for pluripotent cell growth.",Becker JL; Prewett TL; Spaulding GF; Goodwin TJ,,1993,Journal of cellular biochemistry,Journal Article; Review,,
rotating_wall,9230602,Vaginal hysterectomy.,"The authors report on their experience of vaginal hysterectomy in a prospective series of 14 patients with myomatous uteri of the size of 14 to 20 weeks' gestation. The mean uterine volume at the time of surgery was that of 16 1/2 weeks' gestation. The largest myoma had a diameter of 11.6 cm. Five of the patients were also scheduled to undergo bilateral oophorectomy. The paracervical tissues were infiltrated with a dilute solution of lignocaine and adrenaline. Circumferential incision and reflection of the vaginal wall, dissection of the bladder cephalad, opening of the vesico-uterine fold anteriorly and the pouch of Douglas posteriorly were performed initially. This was followed by clamping, division and ligation of the sacro-uterine and cardinal ligaments and of the uterine vessels, as is done during a vaginal hysterectomy. The next step depended on the size and other features of the uterine corpus and included bisection, myomectomy, morcellation and coring. BISECTION: The cervix was grasped on both sides and the uterus was bisected sagittally towards the fundus, using a knife. The bisection, carried out first along the posterior uterine wall, was aided by the repeated repositioning of the vulsella close to the apex of the incision, combined with rotation of the cervical portion of the uterus around the public arch. If necessary, the uterus was rotated back to its original position and the bisection pursued anteriorly. Complete bisection often allowed half the uterus to be delivered through the vagina and the ovarian pedicle to be secured; the same was then done with the other half of the uterus. Myomectomy was frequently combined with bisection or morcellation. Smaller myomas were removed in one piece while larger ones were morcellated and removed in fragments, one of the vulsella always being attached to the residual bulk of the myoma. Morcellation was carried out on the uterus when despite bisection or myomectomy no further descent was possible. Bisection was recommenced as soon as further descent of the uterus could be achieved after myomectomy and morcellation. Coring was performed instead of bisection when dealing with smaller uteri without any distinct large myoma. A circumferential incision was made at the level of the uterine isthmus about 5 mm into the substance of the corpus. A central core of tissue around the uterine cavity was then excised by progressively undercutting the serosal surface of the uterus towards the fundus. Once the uterus was delivered into the vagina, the hysterectomy was completed in the usual fashion. All 14 procedures with or without oophorectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy were completed successfully. The mean weight of the uteri was 639 g (range 380-1100 g), the mean operating time was 84 minutes (range 30-150 minutes) and the mean operative blood loss was estimated at 296 ml (range 100-800 ml). One patient was given a blood transfusion immediately postoperatively. Six women had macroscopic haematuria that cleared up within 24 hours. There were no other important complications. Postoperative hospital stay averaged 3.7 days (range 2-9 days). Only 2 patients remained in hospital for more than 4 days after surgery. All women had recovered fully by the time of their follow up appointment.",Amy JJ,,1997,The National medical journal of India,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,26826674,Scaffold-free Tissue Formation Under Real and Simulated Microgravity Conditions.,"Scaffold-free tissue formation in microgravity is a new method in regenerative medicine and an important topic in Space Medicine. In this MiniReview, we focus on recent findings in the field of tissue engineering that were observed by exposing cells to real microgravity in space or to devices simulating to at least some extent microgravity conditions on Earth (ground-based facilities). Under both conditions - real and simulated microgravity - a part of the cultured cells of various populations detaches from the bottom of a culture flask. The cells form three-dimensional (3D) aggregates resembling the organs from which the cells have been derived. As spaceflights are rare and extremely expensive, cell culture under simulated microgravity allows more comprehensive and frequent studies on the scaffold-free 3D tissue formation in some aspects, as a number of publications have proven during the last two decades. In this MiniReview, we summarize data from our own studies and work from various researchers about tissue engineering of multi-cellular spheroids formed by cancer cells, tube formation by endothelial cells and cartilage formation by exposing the cells to ground-based facilities such as the 3D Random Positioning Machine (RPM), the 2D Fast-Rotating Clinostat (FRC) or the Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV). Subsequently, we investigated self-organization of 3D aggregates without scaffolds pursuing to enhance the frequency of 3D formation and to enlarge the size of the organ-like aggregates. The density of the monolayer exposed to real or simulated microgravity as well as the composition of the culture media revealed an impact on the results. Genomic and proteomic alterations were induced by simulated microgravity. Under microgravity conditions, adherent cells expressed other genes than cells grown in spheroids. In this MiniReview, the recent improvements in scaffold-free tissue formation are summarized and relationships between phenotypic and molecular appearance are highlighted.

rotating_wall,34819344,Applications of the Columbus steerable guidewire.,"The Columbus steerable guidewire (Rapid Medical, Israel) is a 0.014 inch guidewire with a remotely controlled deflectable tip intended for neuronavigational purposes. 1 The tip can be shaped by pulling or pushing the handle. Pulling the handle decreases the radius (from 4 mm to 2 mm) and curves the tip, while pushing the handle increases the curvature radius and straightens the tip until it bends in the opposite direction. The amount of deflection is at the discretion of the operator. Video 1 The response of the Columbus guidewire to rotational movements is inferior to that of standard wires, and the tip is very soft and malleable but brings great support when bent. We present two cases where the Columbus guidewire was used. In the first case, the Columbus enabled us to probe a posterior cerebral artery arising from a giant basilar tip aneurysm without wall contact. In the second case, the Columbus was used as a secondary wire to help cannulate the pericallosal artery in a patient with a recurrent anterior complex aneurysm; this subsequently permitted successful stent-assisted coiling of the aneurysm. neurintsurg;14/10/1045/V1F1V1Video 1. commercial re-use.

The suspension culture system used in this study is the high-aspect-ratio vessel, one type of the rotating wall vessel, that provides a high rate of gas exchange necessary for rapidly dividing cells. Cells were grown in the high-aspect-ratio vessel, and DNA microarray and metabolic analyses were used to determine the resulting changes in yeast gene expression. A significant number of genes were found to be up- or downregulated by at least twofold as a result of rotational growth. By using Gibbs promoter alignment, clusters of genes were examined for promoter elements mediating these genetic changes. Candidate binding motifs similar to the Rap1p binding site and the stress-responsive element were identified in the promoter regions of differentially regulated genes. This study shows that, as in higher order organisms, S. cerevisiae changes gene expression in response to rotational culture and also provides clues for investigations into the signaling pathways involved in gravitational response.",Johanson K; Allen PL; Lewis F; Cubano LA; Hyman LE; Hammond TG,NASA Discipline Cell Biology; Non-NASA Center,2002,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)","Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,31062700,Intravascular lithotripsy for calcific coronary and peripheral artery stenoses.,"Heavily calcified lesions may be difficult to dilate adequately with conventional balloons and stents, which causes frequent periprocedural complications and higher rates of target lesion revascularisation (TLR). High-pressure non-compliant balloon angioplasty may be of insufficient force to modify calcium and, even when successful, may be limited in its ability to modify the entire calcified lesion. Scoring and cutting balloons hold theoretical value but data to support their efficacy are lacking and, because of their high lesion crossing profile, they often fail to reach the target lesion. Rotational and orbital atherectomy target superficial calcium; however, deep calcium, which may still impact on vessel expansion and luminal gain, is not affected. Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL), based on lithotripsy for renal calculi, is a new technology which uses sonic pressure waves to disrupt calcium with minimal impact to soft tissue. Energy is delivered via a balloon catheter, analogous to contemporary balloon catheters, with transmission through diluted ionic contrast in a semi-compliant balloon inflated at low pressure with sufficient diameter to achieve contact with the vessel wall.

rotating_wall,11543416,Dynamics of a microcarrier particle in the simulated microgravity environment of a rotating-wall vessel.,"Rotating-wall vessel (RWV), a low-shear, low turbulence microcarrier culture system provides a simulated microgravity environment suitable for 3-dimensional tissue culture. In this paper, the motion of a microcarrier particle in the rotating fluid has been analytically/numerically studied. If the microcarrier is less dense than the surrounding liquid medium, it eventually migrates towards an equilibrium state in the fluid. This state corresponds to a stationary location in the inertial frame of reference or equivalently, a circular orbit about the rotational axis in a rotating frame. If the particle is denser, it may move away indefinitely to reach or collide with the outer wall of the rotating vessel (outer boundary of the rotating fluid). Such a collision may damage the cells and could be undesirable for tissue culture. We have calculated migration times for a denser microcarrier to reach the outer wall of the vessel. Several factors--rotational speed, fluid viscosity, density difference between that of the microcarrier and the fluid, microcarrier radius, and the initial position of the microcarrier--were found to affect this migration time. We have also evaluated the variation of the fluid shear stress on the microcarrier surface. Decreasing the density difference between the microcarrier and the fluid, and decreasing the size of the microcarrier, can both decrease the maximum shear stress. The results for a solid, a hollow, and a hollow-porous microcarrier show that with a denser microcarrier material, the hollow or hollow-porous spherical microcarriers are preferable in order to increase the suspension time and decrease the maximum shear stress. The results of this study are thought to be useful for the development of optimal conditions for cell growth and metabolism in RWVs.",Gao H; Ayyaswamy PS; Ducheyne P,,1997,Microgravity science and technology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,

Tissue culture bioreactors called rotating-wall vessels were used in conjunction with multicellular cocultivation to develop a unique in vitro tissue-modeling system. Normal small intestine epithelium and mesenchymal cells were cocultivated on Cytodex-3 microcarriers and were initiated in two phases. Normal small intestine mesenchymal cells were inoculated into the rotating-wall vessel at 2 x 10(5) cells/ml and allowed to attach and proliferate for 2 to 3 days. Normal small intestine epithelium was then added at an innoculum of 2 x 10(5) cells/ml and cultivation continued for 30 to 40 days. These cocultures attained cell numbers of 4-6 x 10(6) cells/ml and differentiated to form tissue-like masses of 0.4-0.5 cm with minimal necrosis. The masses displayed apical brush borders, differentiated epithelial cells, cellular polarity, extracellular matrix, and basal lamina. Verification of mesenchymal and epithelial cell expression was determined by immunocytochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. These data suggest that the rotating-wall vessel affords a new tissue culture model for investigation of growth, regulatory, and differentiation processes within normal tissues.",Goodwin TJ; Schroeder WF; Wolf DA; Moyer MP,,1993,Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Although the use of artificial vessels has led to many successful advancements, blood clotting remains a major challenge, especially in terms of mural clots created along the vessel wall that do not completely block the vessel. The main objective of this study is to present a method for declotting artificial vessels. This research introduces a novel thrombectomy technique in artificial vessels by employing nano-magnetic particles under a rotating magnetic field to remove mural clots in artificial vessels. A mathematical model describes the relationship between process parameters. In vitro tests confirm the feasibility of nano-magnetic thrombectomy in cleaning and declotting artificial vessels. The results show that the clot fragments are nano-sized, which eliminates the risk of distal emboli as a concern of using current atherectomy techniques. Meanwhile, no damage to the artificial vessels is observed. The results show that the frequency of rotating the magnetic field has the greatest effect on clot removal.

rotating_wall,364949,Drug effects on platelet adherence to collagen and damaged vessel walls.,"The interaction of platelets with damaged vessel walls leads to the formation of platelet-fibrin thrombi and may also contribute to the development of atherosclerotic lesions because platelets adherent to exposed collagen release a mitogen that stimulates smooth muscle cell proliferation. The first step in thrombus formation, platelet adherence to an injured vessel wall, can be studied quantitatively by the use of platelets labeled with 51chromium. In these investigations, rabbit aortas were damaged by passage of a balloon catheter and segments of the aortas were everted on probes that were rotated in platelet suspensions. Collagen-coated glass cylinders were also used. Adherence was measured in a medium containing approximately physiologic concentrations of calcium, magnesium, protein and red blood cells. Conditions of testing influence the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sulfinpyrazone, and dipyridamole on platelet adherence. Aspirin and sulfinpyrazone were not inhibitory when tested in a medium with a 40% hematocrit; this indicates that products formed by platelets from arachidonate probably do not play a major part in the adherence of the first layer of platelets to the surface, although they may be involved in thrombus formation. Indomethacin, dipyridamole, prostaglandin E1, methylprednisolone and penicillin G and related antibiotics did inhibit platelet adherence although the concentrations required were higher than would likely be achieved in vivo upon administration to human patients. None of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibited the release of granule contents from adherent platelets. Pretreatment of the damaged vessel wall with aspirin increased platelet adherence, presumably because it prevented the formation of PGI2 by the vessel wall. Platelet adherence to undamaged or damaged vessel walls was enhanced by prior exposure of the wall to thrombin. Platelet reactions with aggregating agents and platelet survival can be modified by changes in dietary lipids but there is very little evidence concerning the effects of lipids on platelet adherence. If some forms of dietary fat damage the endothelium, platelet interaction with the damaged area and release of the mitogen for smooth muscle cells would contribute to the development of atherosclerotic lesions.",Packham MA; Cazenave JP; Kinlough-Rathbone RL; Mustard JF,,1978,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,Journal Article; Review,,
rotating_wall,16944770,Numerical simulation of microcarrier motion in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the forces of rotational wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor on small tissue pieces or microcarrier particles and to determine the tracks of microcarrier particles in RWV bioreactor. METHODS: The motion of the microcarrier in the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor with both the inner and outer cylinders rotating was modeled by numerical simulation. RESULTS: The continuous trajectory of microcarrier particles, including the possible collision with the wall was obtained. An expression between the minimum rotational speed difference of the inner and outer cylinders and the microcarrier particle or aggregate radius could avoid collisions with either wall. The range of microcarrier radius or tissue size, which could be safely cultured in the RWV bioreactor, in terms of shear stress level, was determined.

rotating_wall,22865391,Engineered bone tissue associated with vascularization utilizing a rotating wall vessel bioreactor.,"Tissue-engineered bone has attracted much attention as an alternative material for bone grafting; however, implantable bone tissue of an appropriate size and shape for clinical use has not yet been developed due to a lack of vascularization, which results in necrosis of the seeded cells in vivo. This is the first report of bone tissue engineering associated with vascularization by co-culturing bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with MSC-derived endothelial cells (ECs) within a porous scaffold using a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. MSC-derived ECs were identified by immunofluorescence staining for von Willebrand factor (vWF) and by flow cytometry for CD31 expression. The tissue obtained was histochemically analyzed using toluidin blue, hematoxylin and eosin, anti-osteopontin antibody, anti-osteocalcin antibody, and tomato-lectin stain. Results showed that bone tissue containing vascular-like structures was generated. Three-dimensional culture condition created by medium flow in the RWV vessel and the interaction of MSCs with MSC-derived ECs might provide the cells an advantage in the construction of three-dimensional bone tissue with blood vessels.",Nishi M; Matsumoto R; Dong J; Uemura T,,2013,Journal of biomedical materials research.

rotating_wall,19002986,Characterization of aggregation and protein expression of bovine corneal endothelial cells as microcarrier cultures in a rotating-wall vessel.,"Rotating-wall vessels are beneficial to tissue engineering in that the reconstituted tissue formed in these low-shear bioreactors undergoes extensive three-dimensional growth and differentiation. In the present study, bovine corneal endothelial (BCE) cells were grown in a high-aspect rotating-wall vessel (HARV) attached to collagen-coated Cytodex-3 beads as a representative monolayer culture to investigate factors during HARV cultivation which affect three-dimensional growth and protein expression. A collagen type I substratum in T-flask control cultures increased cell density of BCE cells at confluence by 40% and altered the expression of select proteins (43, 50 and 210 kDa). The low-shear environment in the HARV facilitated cell bridging between microcarrier beads to form aggregates containing upwards of 23 beads each, but it did not promote multilayer growth. A kinetic model of microcarrier aggregation was developed which indicates that the rate of aggregation between a single bead and an aggregate was nearly 10 times faster than between two aggregate and 60 times faster than between two single beads. These differences reflect changes in collision frequency and cell bridge formation. HARV cultivation altered the expression of cellular proteins (43 and 70 kDa) and matrix proteins (50, 73, 89 and 210 kDa) relative to controls perhaps due to hypoxia, fluid flow or distortion of cell shape. In addition to the insight that this work has provided into rotating-wall vessels, it could be useful in modeling aggregation in other cell systems, propagating human corneal endothelial cells for eye surgery and examining the response of endothelial cells to reduced shear.",Muhitch JW; O'Connor KC; Blake DA; Lacks DJ; Rosenzweig N; Spaulding GF,,2000,Cytotechnology,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,28125920,Effect of Rotation on Scaffold Motion and Cell Growth in Rotating Bioreactors.,"Efficient use of different bioreactor designs to improve cell growth in three-dimensional scaffolds requires an understanding of their mechanism of action. To address this for rotating wall vessel bioreactors, fluid and scaffold motion were investigated experimentally at different rotation speeds and vessel fill volumes. Low cost bioreactors with single and dual axis rotation were developed to investigate the effect of these systems on human osteoblast proliferation in free floating and constrained collagen-glycosaminoglycan porous scaffolds. A range of scaffold motions (free fall, periodic oscillation, and orbital motion) were observed at the rotation speeds and vessel fluid/air ratios used, with 85% fluid fill and an outer vessel wall velocity of ∼14 mm s(-1) producing a scaffold in a free fall state. The cell proliferation results showed that after 14 and 21 days of culture, this combination of fluid fill and speed of rotation produced significantly greater cell numbers in the scaffolds than when lower or higher rotation speeds (p < 0.002) or when the chamber was 60% or 100% full (p < 0.01). The fluid flow and scaffold motion experiments show that biaxial rotation would not improve the mass transfer of medium into the scaffold as the second axis of rotation can only transition the scaffold toward oscillatory or orbital motion and, hence, reduce mass transport to the scaffold. The cell culture results confirmed that there was no benefit to the second axis of rotation with no significant difference in cell proliferation either when the scaffolds were free floating or constrained (p > 0.05).",Varley MC; Markaki AE; Brooks RA,biaxial; bioreactor; cell proliferation; collagen scaffold; fluid flow; rotating wall vessel,2017,Tissue engineering.

Drugs continue to be withdrawn from the market due to unforeseen toxicity, side effects, and drug interactions. The space program may be able to provide a lifeline. Best known for rockets, space shuttles, astronauts and engineering, the space program has also delivered some serious medical science. Optimized suspension culture in NASA's specialized suspension culture devices, known as rotating wall vessels, uniquely maintains Phase I and Phase II drug metabolizing pathways in hepatocytes for weeks in cell culture. Previously prohibitively expensive, new materials and 3D printing techniques have the potential to make the NASA rotating wall vessel available inexpensively on an industrial scale.

rotating_wall,35629329,CAMDLES: CFD-DEM Simulation of Microbial Communities in Spaceflight and Artificial Microgravity.,"We present CAMDLES (CFD-DEM Artificial Microgravity Developments for Living Ecosystem Simulation), an extension of CFDEM(®)Coupling to model biological flows, growth, and mass transfer in artificial microgravity devices. For microbes that accompany humans into space, microgravity-induced alterations in the fluid environment are likely to be a major factor in the microbial experience of spaceflight. Computational modeling is needed to investigate how well ground-based microgravity simulation methods replicate that experience. CAMDLES incorporates agent-based modeling to study inter-species metabolite transport within microbial communities in rotating wall vessel bioreactors (RWVs). Preexisting CFD modeling of RWVs has not yet incorporated growth; CAMDLES employs the simultaneous modeling of biological, chemical, and mechanical processes in a micro-scale rotating reference frame environment. Simulation mass transfer calculations were correlated with Monod dynamic parameters to predict relative growth rates between artificial microgravity, spaceflight microgravity, and 1 g conditions. By simulating a microbial model community of metabolically cooperative strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, we found that the greatest difference between microgravity and an RWV or 1 g gravity was when species colocalized in dense aggregates. We also investigated the influence of other features of the system on growth, such as spatial distribution, product yields, and diffusivity. Our simulation provides a basis for future laboratory experiments using this community for investigation in artificial microgravity and spaceflight microgravity. More broadly, our development of these models creates a framework for novel hypothesis generation and design of biological experiments with RWVs, coupling the effects of RWV size, rotation rate, and mass transport directly to bacterial growth in microbial communities.",An R; Lee JA,CFD-DEM; clinostat; computational fluid dynamics; microbial community; microgravity; population dynamics; rotating wall vessel,2022,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",Journal Article,,

We have previously shown that human ear perichondrium harbors a population of cartilage progenitor cells (CPCs). The aim of this study was to examine the use of a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor for CPCs to engineer 3-D elastic cartilage in vitro. Human CPCs isolated from ear perichondrium were expanded and differentiated into chondrocytes under 2-D culture conditions. Fully differentiated CPCs were seeded into recently developed pC-HAp/ChS (porous material consisted of collagen, hydroxyapatite, and chondroitinsulfate) scaffolds and 3-D cultivated utilizing a RWV bioreactor. 3-D engineered constructs appeared shiny with a yellowish, cartilage-like morphology. The shape of the molded scaffold was maintained after RWV cultivation. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed engraftment of CPCs inside pC-HAp/ChS. Alcian blue and Elastica Van Gieson staining showed of proteoglycan and elastic fibers, which are unique extracellular matrices of elastic cartilage. Thus, human CPCs formed elastic cartilage-like tissue after 3-D cultivation in a RWV bioreactor.

rotating_wall,16384837,Dynamic culture in a rotating-wall vessel bioreactor differentially inhibits murine T-lymphocyte activation by mitogenic stimuli upon return to static conditions in a time-dependent manner.,"Depressed immune function is a well-documented effect of spaceflight. Both in-flight studies and ground-based studies using microgravity analogs, such as rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors, have demonstrated that mitogen-stimulated T lymphocytes exhibit decreased proliferation, IL-2 secretion, and activation marker expression in true microgravity and the dynamic RWV-culture environment. This study investigates the kinetics of RWV-induced T lymphocyte inhibition by monitoring the ability of Balb/c mouse splenocytes to become activated under static culture conditions after concanavalin A (Con A) stimulation in an RWV. Splenocytes were stimulated with Con A and cultured for up to 24 h in the RWV before being allowed to ""recover"" under static culture conditions in the continued presence of Con A. The T-lymphocyte fraction of splenocytes was assayed during the recovery period for IL-2 secretion, expansion of the T-lymphocyte population, and expression of the activation marker CD25. Our results indicate that CD25 expression was not affected by any duration of RWV exposure. In contrast, proliferation and IL-2 secretion were inhibited by >8 and 12 h of exposure, respectively. Culture in the RWV for 24 h resulted in a near-complete loss of cellular viability during the recovery period, which was not seen in cells maintained in the RWV for 16 h or less. Taken together, these results indicate that for up to 8 h of RWV culture activation is not significantly impaired upon return to static conditions; longer duration RWV culture results in a gradual loss of activation during the recovery period most likely because of decreased T-cell viability and/or IL-2 production.",Simons DM; Gardner EM; Lelkes PI,,2006,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)","Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,12851824,Cardiovascular deconditioning in microgravity: some possible countermeasures.,"Microgravity is an extreme environment inducing relevant adaptive changes in the human body, especially after prolonged periods of exposure. Since the early sixties, numerous studies on the effects of microgravity, during manned Space flights, have produced an increasing amount of information concerning its physiological effects, globally defined ""deconditioning"". Microgravity deconditioning of the cardiovascular system (CVD) is briefly reviewed. It consists of: (1) a decrease of circulating blood and interstitial fluid volumes, (2) a decrease of arterial blood diastolic pressure, (3) a decrease of ventricular stroke volume, (4) a decrease of the estimated left ventricular mass and (5) resetting of the carotid baroreceptors. The negative effects of microgravity deconditioning manifest themselves mostly upon the reentry to Earth. They consist mainly of: (1) dizziness, (2) increased heart rate and heart palpitations, (3) an inability to assume the standing position (orthostatic intolerance), (4) pre-syncopal feelings due to postural stress and (5) reduced exercise capacity. To avoid these drawbacks several countermeasures have been proposed; they will be briefly mentioned with emphasis on the ""Twin Bikes System"" (TBS). This consists of two coupled bicycles operated by astronauts and counter-rotating along the inner wall of a cylindrical Space module, thus generating a centrifugal force vector, mimicking gravity.",Antonutto G; di Prampero PE,,2003,European journal of applied physiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",,
rotating_wall,33694334,"Pseudo-Enhancement in Intracranial Aneurysms on Black-Blood MRI: Effects of Flow Rate, Spatial Resolution, and Additional Flow Suppression.","BACKGROUND: Vessel-wall enhancement (VWE) on black-blood MRI (BB MRI) has been proposed as an imaging marker for a higher risk of rupture and associated with wall inflammation. Whether VWE is causally linked to inflammation or rather induced by flow phenomena has been a subject of debate. PURPOSE: To study the effects of slow flow, spatial resolution, and motion-sensitized driven equilibrium (MSDE) preparation on signal intensities in BB MRI of patient-specific aneurysm flow models. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. SUBJECTS/FLOW ANEURYSM MODEL/VIRTUAL VESSELS: Aneurysm flow models based on 3D rotational angiography datasets of three patients with intracranial aneurysms were 3D printed and perfused at two different flow rates, with and without Gd-containing contrast agent. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Variable refocusing flip angle 3D fast-spin echo sequence at 3 T with and without MSDE with three voxel sizes ((0.5 mm)(3) , (0.7 mm)(3) , and (0.9 mm)(3) ); time-resolved with phase-contrast velocity-encoding 3D spoiled gradient echo sequence (4D flow MRI). ASSESSMENT: Three independent observers performed a qualitative visual assessment of flow patterns and signal enhancement. Quantitative analysis included voxel-wise evaluation of signal intensities and magnitude velocity distributions in the aneurysm. STATISTICAL TESTS: Kruskal-Wallis test, potential regressions. RESULTS: A hyperintense signal in the lumen and adjacent to the aneurysm walls on BB MRI was colocalized with slow flow. Signal intensities increased by a factor of 2.56 ± 0.68 (P < 0.01) after administering Gd contrast. After Gd contrast administration, the signal was suppressed most in conjunction with high flows and with MSDE (2.41 ± 2.07 for slow flow without MSDE, and 0.87 ± 0.99 for high flow with MSDE). A clear result was not achieved by modifying the spatial resolution . DATA CONCLUSIONS: Slow-flow phenomena contribute substantially to aneurysm enhancement and vary with MRI parameters.

rotating_wall,24074633,Perforasomes of the upper abdomen: an anatomical study.,"INTRODUCTION: Pedicled perforator flaps in the trunk such as the DIEAP or the IMAP-flap have increasingly been used for reconstructive purposes. However, perforator flaps of the upper abdominal wall derived from the SEA and DIEA have not been widely reported in literature. The aim of this study was to investigate the vascular basis of perforator flaps of the upper abdominal wall based on the epigastric vascular axis and to describe the location and size of the individual flaps. METHODS: The superior and deep inferior epigastric artery perforators (SEAPs and DIEAPs) of the supraumbilical abdominal wall of ten fresh anatomical specimens were selectively injected with Methylene blue solution or India ink. The location and size of the labeled skin area was observed. Finally, the arterial perforators were dissected and the length, diameter and the distance of the perforation point to the midline, xiphoid process and umbilicus were recorded. RESULTS: The SEAPs and DIEAPs supplied the ventromedial skin of the lower thoracic and supraumbilical abdominal wall in a sequential order. The mean size of all injected skin areas was 65 ± 31.4 cm(2) (10.2 × 8.8 cm). A mean number of 9.7 ± 4.2 perforators per specimen was identified. The mean external diameter of the dissected perforators was 0.82 ± 0.32 mm. The perforator length until arborization averaged 3.44 ± 1.07 cm. Most perforators were located in an area 2-6 cm from the midline and 0-10 cm below the xiphoid process. DISCUSSION: Through selective injection of perforators, a reliable anatomy of SEAP- and DIEAP-flaps of the upper abdominal wall could be demonstrated. From a clinical point of view, subcostal SEAP-flaps are of special interest. These flaps may be rotated cranially for lower chest wall or breast reconstruction or deflected caudally for abdominal wall reconstructive purposes.

rotating_wall,33232584,3D Oral and Cervical Tissue Models for Studying Papillomavirus Host-Pathogen Interactions.,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection occurs in differentiating epithelial tissues. Cancers caused by high-risk types (e.g., HPV16 and HPV18) typically occur at oropharyngeal and anogenital anatomical sites. The HPV life cycle is differentiation-dependent, requiring tissue culture methodology that is able to recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) stratified epithelium. Here we report two distinct and complementary methods for growing differentiating epithelial tissues that mimic many critical morphological and biochemical aspects of in vivo tissue. The first approach involves growing primary human epithelial cells on top of a dermal equivalent consisting of collagen fibers and living fibroblast cells. When these cells are grown at the liquid-air interface, differentiation occurs and allows for epithelial stratification. The second approach uses a rotating wall vessel bioreactor. The low-fluid-shear microgravity environment inside the bioreactor allows the cells to use collagen-coated microbeads as a growth scaffold and self-assemble into 3D cellular aggregates. These approaches are applied to epithelial cells derived from HPV-positive and HPV-negative oral and cervical tissues. The second part of the article introduces potential downstream applications for these 3D tissue models. We describe methods that will allow readers to start successfully culturing 3D tissues from oral and cervical cells. These tissues have been used for microscopic visualization, scanning electron microscopy, and large omics-based studies to gain insights into epithelial biology, the HPV life cycle, and host-pathogen interactions. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

rotating_wall,22060498,Moving walls accelerate mixing.,"Mixing in viscous fluids is challenging, but chaotic advection in principle allows efficient mixing. In the best possible scenario, the decay rate of the concentration profile of a passive scalar should be exponential in time. In practice, several authors have found that the no-slip boundary condition at the walls of a vessel can slow down mixing considerably, turning an exponential decay into a power law. This slowdown affects the whole mixing region, and not just the vicinity of the wall. The reason is that when the chaotic mixing region extends to the wall, a separatrix connects to it. The approach to the wall along that separatrix is polynomial in time and dominates the long-time decay. However, if the walls are moved or rotated, closed orbits appear, separated from the central mixing region by a hyperbolic fixed point with a homoclinic orbit. The long-time approach to the fixed point is exponential, so an overall exponential decay is recovered, albeit with a thin unmixed region near the wall.",Thiffeault JL; Gouillart E; Dauchot O,,2011,"Physical review.

rotating_wall,1605117,Intravascular ultrasound of the coronary arteries: current applications and future directions.,"Although angiography is widely applied in the diagnosis of the coronary artery disease (CAD), studies have questioned the accuracy of radiographic methods. Miniaturized intravascular ultrasound devices offer several potential advantages, including a tomographic orientation and the ability to characterize atherosclerotic plaques. Two dissimilar technical approaches to transducer design have emerged: mechanically rotated devices and multi-element arrays, each yielding small coronary catheters (1.1-1.8 mm in diameter). Initial studies of coronary ultrasound have demonstrated few serious untoward effects. In most normal subjects, the vessel wall is laminar in appearance with an intimal leading edge and subintimal sonolucent layer averaging less than or equal to 0.20 mm in thickness. In most CAD patients, the thickness of the leading-edge or sonolucent zone is abnormally increased. Atherosclerotic abnormalities are frequently evident in segments with no angiographic lesion. At sites with a circular lumen shape, minimum diameter by ultrasound and angiography correlate closely, r = 0.93. At sites with an eccentric lumen, significant disagreement between angiography and ultrasound diameter is evident, r = 0.78. Correlation between angiography and ultrasound from percent stenosis is moderate, r = 0.63. Following balloon angioplasty percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), morphologic findings include complex cracks, splits, and dissections, and minimum lumen diameter by angiography and intravascular ultrasound correlate poorly. Recent advances have improved the utility of coronary ultrasound, including smaller catheters and a device combining a miniature imaging transducer (1.16 mm) with a low profile balloon (0.028-0.033 inch). Important current limitations include inability to visualize the smallest coronaries and tight stensoses. The future of coronary ultrasound is promising, propelled by the unique capability of this modality to image atherosclerotic plaques directly.",Nissen SE; Gurley JC; Booth DC; DeMaria AN,,1992,The American journal of cardiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Review",,
rotating_wall,25199120,Optimal 3D culture of primary articular chondrocytes for use in the rotating wall vessel bioreactor.,"INTRODUCTION: Reliable culturing methods for primary articular chondrocytes are essential to study the effects of loading and unloading on joint tissue at the cellular level. Due to the limited proliferation capacity of primary chondrocytes and their tendency to dedifferentiate in conventional culture conditions, long-term culturing conditions of primary chondrocytes can be challenging. The goal of this study was to develop a suspension culturing technique that not only would retain the cellular morphology, but also maintain the gene expression characteristics of primary articular chondrocytes. METHODS: Three-dimensional culturing methods were compared and optimized for primary articular chondrocytes in the rotating wall vessel bioreactor, which changes the mechanical culture conditions to provide a form of suspension culture optimized for low shear and turbulence. We performed gene expression analysis and morphological characterization of cells cultured in alginate beads, Cytopore-2 microcarriers, primary monolayer culture, and passaged monolayer cultures using reverse transcription-PCR and laser scanning confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Primary chondrocytes grown on Cytopore-2 microcarriers maintained the phenotypical morphology and gene expression pattern observed in primary bovine articular chondrocytes, and retained these characteristics for up to 9 d. DISCUSSION: Our results provide a novel and alternative culturing technique for primary chondrocytes suitable for studies that require suspension such as those using the rotating wall vessel bioreactor. In addition, we provide an alternative culturing technique for primary chondrocytes that can impact future mechanistic studies of osteoarthritis progression, treatments for cartilage damage and repair, and cartilage tissue engineering.",Mellor LF; Baker TL; Brown RJ; Catlin LW; Oxford JT,,2014,"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",P20RR016454/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States; K02AR48672/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States; K02 AR048672/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States; P20 GM103408/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States; P20 GM109095/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States; P20 RR016454/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States; P20GM103408/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States; R01 AR047985/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States; R01AR047985/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States; R15 HD059949/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States,

Although some information is available regarding the cellular and molecular changes in lymphocytes exposed to microgravity, little is known about the erythroid cellular changes that may underlie the reduction in erythropoiesis and resultant anemia. We now report a reduction in erythroid growth and a profound inhibition of erythropoietin (Epo)-induced differentiation in a ground-based simulated microgravity model system. Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cells were grown either in tissue culture vessels at 1 x g or in the simulated microgravity environment of the NASA-designed rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Logarithmic growth was observed under both conditions; however, the doubling time in simulated microgravity was only one-half of that seen at 1 x g. No difference in apoptosis was detected. Induction with Epo at the initiation of the culture resulted in differentiation of approximately 25% of the cells at 1 x g, consistent with our previous observations. In contrast, induction with Epo at the initiation of simulated microgravity resulted in only one-half of this degree of differentiation. Significantly, the growth of cells in simulated microgravity for 24 h prior to Epo induction inhibited the differentiation almost completely. The results suggest that the NASA RWV bioreactor may serve as a suitable ground-based microgravity simulator to model the cellular and molecular changes in erythroid cells observed in true microgravity.",Sytkowski AJ; Davis KL,NASA Discipline Cell Biology; Non-NASA Center,2001,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

Upon coculture of LNCaP cells with microcarrier beads either in the presence or in the absence of prostate or bone stromal cells, 3D prostate organoids were formed with the expected hormonal responsiveness to androgen, increased cell growth, and prostate-specific antigen production. In this communication, we define permanent phenotypic and genotypic changes of LNCaP cells upon coculture with microcarrier beads alone, or with microcarrier beads previously seeded with either prostate or bone stromal cells. Most notably, we observed selective genetic changes, i.e., chromosomal losses or gains, as evaluated by both conventional cytogenetic and comparative genomic hybridization, in LNCaP sublines derived from the prostate organoids. Moreover, the derivative LNCaP cells appear to have altered growth profiles, and exhibit permanent and stable changes in response to androgen, estrogen, and growth factors. The derivative LNCaP sublines showed increased anchorage-independent growth rate, and enhanced tumorigenicity and metastatic potential when inoculated orthotopically in castrated athymic mice. Our results support the hypothesis that further nonrandom genetic and phenotypic changes in prostate cancer epithelial cells can occur through an event that resembles ""adaptive mutation"" such as has been described in bacteria subjected to nutritional starvation.

Three experimental groups were used: stationary control, rotational control and clinostat rotation. Three experiments were performed as follows. The first experiment showed that compared with the other two (control) groups, embryonic development was significantly retarded after 72 h in the clinostat rotation group. The second experiment showed that more nitric oxide (NO) was produced in the culture medium in the clinostat rotation group after 72 h (P<0.05), and the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in this group was significantly higher than in the controls (P<0.01). In the third experiment, we studied apoptosis in the pre-implantation mouse embryos after 72 h in culture and found that Annexin-V staining was negative in the normal (stationary and rotational control) embryos, but the developmentally retarded (clinostat rotation) embryos showed a strong green fluorescence. These results indicate that microgravity induced developmental retardation and cell apoptosis in the mouse embryos. We presume that these effects are related to the higher concentration of NO in the embryos under microgravity, which have cause cytotoxic consequences.",Cao YJ; Fan XJ; Shen Z; Ma BH; Duan EK,,2007,Cell biology international,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,34591302,Fabrication of a Completely Biological and Anisotropic Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Based Vascular Graft.,"Tissue-engineered small-diameter vascular grafts are required to match mechanical properties as well as cellular and extracellular architecture of native blood vessels. Although various engineering technologies have been developed, the most reliable strategy highlights the needs for incorporating completely biological components and anisotropic cellular and biomolecular organization into the tissue-engineered vascular graft (TEVG). Based on the antithrombogenic, immunoregulatory, and regenerative properties of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), this chapter provides a step-by-step protocol for generating a completely biological and anisotropic TEVG that comprises of hMSCs and highly aligned extracellular matrix (ECM) nanofibers. The hMSCs were grown on an aligned nanofibrous ECM scaffold derived from an oriented human dermal fibroblast (hDF) sheet and then wrapped around a temporary mandrel to form a tubular assembly, followed by a maturation process in a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. The resulting TEVG demonstrates anisotropic structural and mechanical properties similar to that of native blood vessels. A completely biological, anisotropic, and mechanically strong TEVG that incorporates immunoregulatory hMSCs is promising to meet the urgent needs of a surgical intervention for bypass grafting.

rotating_wall,23740768,Imaging and characterization of bioengineered blood vessels within a bioreactor using free-space and catheter-based OCT.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Regenerative medicine involves the bioengineering of a functional tissue or organ by seeding living cells on a biodegradable scaffold cultured in a bioreactor. A major barrier to creating functional tissues, however, has been the inability to monitor the dynamic and complex process of scaffold maturation in real time, making control and optimization extremely difficult. Current methods to assess maturation of bioengineered constructs, such as histology or organ bath physiology, are sample-destructive. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has recently emerged as a key modality for structural assessment of native blood vessels as well as engineered vessel mimics. The objective of this study was to monitor and assess in real time the development of a bioengineered blood vessel using a novel approach of combining both free-space and catheter-based OCT imaging in a new quartz-walled bioreactor. Development of the blood vessel was characterized by changes in thickness and scattering coefficient over a 30-day period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a novel blood vessel bioreactor utilizing a rotating cylindrical quartz cuvette permitting free-space OCT imaging of an installed vessel's outer surface. A vascular endoscopic OCT catheter was used to image the lumen of the vessels. The quartz cuvette permits 360 degree, free-space OCT imaging of the blood vessel. Bioengineered blood vessels were fabricated using biodegradable polymers (15% PCL/collagen, ∼300 µm thick) and seeded with CH3 10t1/2 mesenchymal stem cells. A swept-source OCT imaging system comprised of a 20 kHz tunable laser (Santec HSL2000) with 1,300 nm central wavelength and 110 nm FWHM bandwidth was used to assess the vessels. OCT images were obtained at days 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 30. Free-space (exterior surface) OCT images were co-registered with endoscopic OCT images to determine the vessel wall thickness. DAPI-stained histological sections, acquired at same time point, were evaluated to quantify wall thickness and cellular infiltration. Non-linear curve fitting of free-space OCT data to the extended Huygen-Fresnel model was performed to determine optical scattering properties. RESULTS: Vessel wall thickness increased from 435 ± 15 µm to 610 ± 27 µm and Vessel scattering coefficient increased from 3.73 ± 0.32 cm⁻¹ to 5.74 ± 0.06 cm⁻¹ over 30 days. Histological studies showed cell migration from the scaffold surface toward the lumen and cell proliferation over the same time course. The imaging procedure did not have any significant impact on scaffold dimensions, cell migration, or cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that combination of free-space and catheter-based OCT for blood vessel imaging provides accurate structural information of the developing blood vessel. We determined that free-space OCT images could be co-registered with catheter-based OCT images to monitor structural features such as wall thickness or delamination of the developing tissue-engineered blood vessel within a bioreactor. Structural parameters and optical properties obtained from OCT imaging correlate with histological sections of the blood vessel and could potentially be used as markers to non-invasively and non-destructively assess regeneration of engineered tissues in real time.",Gurjarpadhye AA; Whited BM; Sampson A; Niu G; Sharma KS; Vogt WC; Wang G; Xu Y; Soker S; Rylander MN; Rylander CG,optical coherence tomography; optical properties; regenerative medicine; swept source; vascular graft,2013,Lasers in surgery and medicine,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",R01 HL098912/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,34998648,Incidence and Characteristics of Incomplete Stent Apposition in Calcified Lesions: An Optical Coherence Tomography Study.,"BACKGROUND: Persistent or late acquired incomplete stent apposition (ISA) may be associated with late or very late stent thrombosis following drug-eluting stent implantation. Presence of calcium at the target lesion may increase the risk of ISA even after rotational atherectomy (RA) followed by stenting with high pressure balloon inflation. The aim of this study is to examine the incidence and characteristics of ISA in heavily calcified lesions. METHODS: A total of 52 heavily calcified coronary artery lesions requiring RA plus stenting were selected and studied. After successful ablation followed by stent implantation, optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed to assess stent expansion and apposition. Presence or absence of ISA was examined and maximal stent strut to vessel wall distance (max SV distance) was measured. In lesions with repeated OCT at follow-up, serial changes in ISA were investigated. RESULTS: ISA was documented in 51 of 52 (98%) lesions. Mean max SV distance was 713 ± 371 μm. In lesions with serial OCT images (n = 11), max SV distance decreased significantly (692.1 ± 420.2 to 462.5 ± 387.0 μm, P < 0.01) but persisted in all but 2 lesions (82%). CONCLUSIONS: ISA is frequently documented in heavily calcified lesions requiring RA. Significant ISA still persisted with minimal improvement in SV distance at follow-up. Prognostic impact of the persistent ISA in such calcified lesions needs further investigations.",Kyodo A; Okura H; Okamura A; Iwai S; Kamon D; Hashimoto Y; Ueda T; Soeda T; Watanabe M; Saito Y,Calcification; Incomplete stent apposition; Optical coherence tomography; Rotational atherectomy,2022,Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,Journal Article,,

Several techniques, especially bone implants and grafts, show great promise for providing a remedy for many skeletal disorders and chondrodystrophies. The bioreactor (rotating-wall vessel, RWV) is a cell culture system that creates a nurturing environment conducive to cell aggregation. Chondrocyte cultures have been studied as implants for repair and replacement of damaged and missing bone and cartilage since 1965 [Chesterman and Smith, J Bone Joint Surg 50B:184-197, 1965]. The ability to use large, tissue-like cartilage aggregates grown in the RWV would be of great clinical significance in treating skeletal disorders. In addition, the RWV may provide a superior method for studying chondrogenesis and chondrogenic mutations.

rotating_wall,29846722,Proximal Parent Vessel Tapering is Associated With Aneurysm at the Middle Cerebral Artery Bifurcation.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral aneurysm initiation and evolution have been linked to hemodynamic and morphological factors. Stenotic morphology upstream to a bifurcation can alter hemodynamic patterns and lead to destructive vessel wall remodeling and aneurysm initiation. The effect of more subtle proximal variations in vessel diameter on bifurcation aneurysm development has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether vessel tapering is associated with aneurysmal presence at the middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation. METHODS: Bilateral catheter three-dimensional rotational angiographic datasets from 33 patients with unilateral unruptured MCA aneurysms and 44 datasets from healthy patients were analyzed. Equidistant cross-sectional cuts were generated along the MCA M1 segment with cross-sectional area measurement using edge-detection filtering. Relative tapering of the M1 segment was evaluated as the TaperingRatio. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed on bilateral patient models and parametric MCAs of constant and tapered inflow vessel. RESULTS: MCA leading to aneurysms had significantly lower TaperingRatio (0.88 ± 0.15) compared to contralateral (1.00 ± 0.16, P = .002) and healthy MCAs (1.00 ± 0.15, P > .001, area under the curve = 0.73), which showed little to no tapering. CFD simulations showed that vessel tapering leads to flow acceleration with higher wall shear stress (WSS) and WSS gradients at the bifurcation apex. CONCLUSION: Aneurysmal but not contralateral or control MCA M1 segments demonstrate a previously undescribed progressive distal tapering phenomenon. This upstream vessel narrowing leads to flow acceleration that accentuates WSS and spatial gradients at the bifurcation apex, a pattern previously shown to favor aneurysm initiation and progression.",Lauric A; Greim-Kuczewski K; Antonov A; Dardik G; Magida JK; Hippelheuser JE; Kono K; Malek AM,Aneurysm formation; Hemodynamics; Intracranial aneurysms; Vessel tapering,2019,Neurosurgery,Journal Article,,

Since the introduction of MSCT, acquisition time, detector number, spatial and temporal resolution have continuously improved with each new scanner generation, resulting in excellent image quality and diagnostic accuracy in the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD). At the same time, developments in MSCT technology have focused on reduction of the radiation dose. In particular, the availability of dose modulation and prospective ECG gating have drastically reduced patient radiation dose. Moreover, with the introduction of 320-slice MSCT, volumetric scanning of the entire heart has become possible in a single heart beat or gantry rotation, thereby eliminating oversampling and stair-step artifact.

rotating_wall,12703976,Three-dimensional growth of endothelial cells in the microgravity-based rotating wall vessel bioreactor.,"We characterized bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) continuously cultured in the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor for up to 30 d. Cultures grew as large tissue-like aggregates (containing 20 or more beads) after 30 d. These cultures appeared to be growing in multilayers around the aggregates, where single beads were covered with confluent BAEC, which displayed the typical endothelial cell (EC) morphology. The 30-d multibead aggregate cultures have a different and smoother surface when viewed under a higher-magnification scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopy of these large BAEC aggregates showed that the cells were viable and formed multilayered sheets that were separated by an extracellular space containing matrix-like material. These three-dimensional cultures also were found to have a basal production of nitric oxide (NO) that was 10-fold higher for the RWV than for the Spinner flask bioreactor (SFB). The BAEC in the RWV showed increased basal NO production, which was dependent on the RWV rotation rate: 73% increase at 8 rpm, 262% increase at 15 rpm, and 500% increase at 20 rpm as compared with control SFB cultures. The addition of l-arginine to the RWV cultures resulted in a fourfold increase in NO production over untreated RWV cultures, which was completely blocked by L-NAME [N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methylester]. Cells in the SFB responded similarly. The RWV cultures showed an increase in barrier properties with an up-regulation of tight junction protein expression. We believe that this study is the first report of a unique growth pattern for ECs, resulting in enhanced NO production and barrier properties, and it suggests that RWV provides a unique model for investigating EC biology and differentiated function.",Sanford GL; Ellerson D; Melhado-Gardner C; Sroufe AE; Harris-Hooker S,,2002,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

rotating_wall,21520841,Dynamic estimation of three-dimensional cerebrovascular deformation from rotational angiography.,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of detecting and quantifying 3D cerebrovascular wall motion from a single 3D rotational x-ray angiography (3DRA) acquisition within a clinically acceptable time and computing from the estimated motion field for the further biomechanical modeling of the cerebrovascular wall. METHODS: The whole motion cycle of the cerebral vasculature is modeled using a 4D B-spline transformation, which is estimated from a 4D to 2D + t image registration framework. The registration is performed by optimizing a single similarity metric between the entire 2D + t measured projection sequence and the corresponding forward projections of the deformed volume at their exact time instants. The joint use of two acceleration strategies, together with their implementation on graphics processing units, is also proposed so as to reach computation times close to clinical requirements. For further characterizing vessel wall properties, an approximation of the wall thickness changes is obtained through a strain calculation. RESULTS: Evaluation on in silico and in vitro pulsating phantom aneurysms demonstrated an accurate estimation of wall motion curves. In general, the error was below 10% of the maximum pulsation, even in the situation when substantial inhomogeneous intensity pattern was present. Experiments on in vivo data provided realistic aneurysm and vessel wall motion estimates, whereas in regions where motion was neither visible nor anatomically possible, no motion was detected. The use of the acceleration strategies enabled completing the estimation process for one entire cycle in 5-10 min without degrading the overall performance. The strain map extracted from our motion estimation provided a realistic deformation measure of the vessel wall. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' technique has demonstrated that it can provide accurate and robust 4D estimates of cerebrovascular wall motion within a clinically acceptable time, although it has to be applied to a larger patient population prior to possible wide application to routine endovascular procedures. In particular, for the first time, this feasibility study has shown that in vivo cerebrovascular motion can be obtained intraprocedurally from a 3DRA acquisition. Results have also shown the potential of performing strain analysis using this imaging modality, thus making possible for the future modeling of biomechanical properties of the vascular wall.",Zhang C; Villa-Uriol MC; De Craene M; Pozo JM; Macho JM; Frangi AF,,2011,Medical physics,Journal Article,,

This system has been applied to the culture of rat coronary endothelial cells obtained with a Langendorff-derived procedure isolation. Endothelial cells are immunopurified on the basis of RECA expression, and conservation of endothelial phenotype has been assessed on the basis of morphology, RECA and von Willebrand factor expressions and diI-Ac-LDL uptake. Shear stress induced by the rotating wall vessel was measured using a mathematical formula specifically designed for this type of model, and its impact on coronary endothelial cells was evaluated. Shear stress produced cell orientation parallel to the flux direction, elevated NO production and decreased monocyte adhesion. Cells were kept viable and functional for at least 4 days under shear. This simple design allows the handling and management of numerous vials in parallel and appears to be suitable for large-scale studies of both the acute and chronic impact of modulation of the physico-chemical environment on endothelial cell physiology and function.",Morin JP; Preterre D; Keravec V; Thuillez C,,2003,Cell biology and toxicology,Journal Article,,

The formulation employs a previously reported shell element that calculates both the membrane and bending behavior via displacement degrees of freedom for a triangular element. The thickness stretch is statically condensed to enforce vessel wall incompressibility via a plane stress condition. Consequently, the formulation allows incorporation of appropriate 3D constitutive material models. We also incorporate external tissue support conditions to model the effect of surrounding tissue. We present theoretical and variational details of the formulation and verify our implementation against axisymmetric results and literature data. We also adapt a previously reported prestress methodology to identify the unloaded configuration corresponding to the medically imaged in vivo vessel geometry. We verify the prestress methodology in an idealized bifurcation model and demonstrate the significance of including prestress. Lastly, we demonstrate the robustness of our formulation via its application to mouse-specific models of arterial mechanics using an experimentally informed four-fiber constitutive model.",Nama N; Aguirre M; Humphrey JD; Figueroa CA,,2020,Scientific reports,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",20POST35220004/AHA/American Heart Association-American Stroke Association/United; R01 HL105297/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; R01 HL105297/NH/NIH HHS/United States,

Within 2-3 d of rotary-cell culture, such cells formed multiple, macroscopic, three-dimensional structures that were orders of magnitude larger than the cellular clusters (""neurospheres"") formed by these cells in conventional stationary-flask cultures. Each HARV structure was composed of a multilayered cellular shell surrounding one or more central cavities that were bordered by pyknotic cell nuclei. Although the cells in the HARV structures were more pleomorphic than those in neurospheres, the structures did not appear to represent primitive neural tumors: the formation of HARV structures by precursor cells was not an irreversible phenotypic change, and the structures did not originate from the clonal expansion of single-progenitor cells; the growth rate and invasiveness of the cells in HARVs were less than those in flasks; and HARV-cultured cells did not form tumors after subcutaneous inoculation into the flanks of NOD-scid/scid mice. Immunohistochemical analysis suggested that HARV structures might be novel ""prototissues"" characterized by a crude, but organized, architecture, with a surface layer of immature proliferating cells (nestin- and proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive) that enclosed strata of more differentiated cells (beta-tubulin III- and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive) within.

rotating_wall,38354258,Dexterous helical magnetic robot for improved endovascular access.,"Treating vascular diseases in the brain requires access to the affected region inside the body. This is usually accomplished through a minimally invasive technique that involves the use of long, thin devices, such as wires and tubes, that are manually maneuvered by a clinician within the bloodstream. By pushing, pulling, and twisting, these devices are navigated through the tortuous pathways of the blood vessels. The outcome of the procedure heavily relies on the clinician's skill and the device's ability to navigate to the affected target region in the bloodstream, which is often inhibited by tortuous blood vessels. Sharp turns require high flexibility, but this flexibility inhibits translation of proximal insertion to distal tip advancement. We present a highly dexterous, magnetically steered continuum robot that overcomes pushability limitations through rotation. A helical protrusion on the device's surface engages with the vessel wall and translates rotation to forward motion at every point of contact. An articulating magnetic tip allows for active steerability, enabling navigation from the aortic arch to millimeter-sized arteries of the brain.

In addition, it calculated the shear stresses imparted on the surface of microcarriers of different densities by the medium fluid in an HARV. Secondary rat marrow stromal cells were cultured on two types of microcarriers, Cytodex-3 beads and modified bioactive glass particles. Examination of cellular morphology by scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of three-dimensional multicellular aggregates consisting of multiple cell-covered Cytodex-3 microcarriers bridged together. Mineralization was observed in the aggregates. Spherical cell-bead aggregates were observed in an HARV, while cell-bead assemblies were mostly loosely packed in a chain-like or branched structure in a cell bag. The expressions of alkaline phosphatase activity, collagen type I, and osteopontin were shown via the use of histochemical staining, immunolabeling, and confocal scanning electron microscopy. Using a numerical approach, it was found that at a given rotational speed and for a given culture medium, a larger density difference between the microcarrier and the culture medium (e.g., a modified bioactive glass particle) imparted a higher maximum shear stress on the microcarrier.",Qiu Q; Ducheyne P; Gao H; Ayyaswamy P,,1998,Tissue engineering,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,9196900,Changes in gravity inhibit lymphocyte locomotion through type I collagen.,"Immunity relies on the circulation of lymphocytes through many different tissues including blood vessels, lymphatic channels, and lymphoid organs. The ability of lymphocytes to traverse the interstitium in both nonlymphoid and lymphoid tissues can be determined in vitro by assaying their capacity to locomote through Type I collagen. In an attempt to characterize potential causes of microgravity-induced immunosuppression, we investigated the effects of simulated microgravity on human lymphocyte function in vitro using a specialized rotating-wall vessel culture system developed at the Johnson Space Center. This very low shear culture system randomizes gravitational vectors and provides an in vitro approximation of microgravity. In the randomized gravity of the rotating-wall vessel culture system, peripheral blood lymphocytes did not locomote through Type I collagen, whereas static cultures supported normal movement. Although cells remained viable during the entire culture period, peripheral blood lymphocytes transferred to unit gravity (static culture) after 6 h in the rotating-wall vessel culture system were slow to recover and locomote into collagen matrix. After 72 h in the rotating-wall vessel culture system and an additional 72 h in static culture, peripheral blood lymphocytes did not recover their ability to locomote. Loss of locomotory activity in rotating-wall vessel cultures appears to be related to changes in the activation state of the lymphocytes and the expression of adhesion molecules. Culture in the rotating-wall vessel system blunted the ability of peripheral blood lymphocytes to respond to polyclonal activation with phytohemagglutinin. Locomotory response remained intact when peripheral blood lymphocytes were activated by anti-CD3 antibody and interleukin-2 prior to introduction into the rotating-wall vessel culture system. Thus, in addition to the systemic stress factors that may affect immunity, isolated lymphocytes respond to gravitational changes by ceasing locomotion through model interstitium. These in vitro investigations suggest that microgravity induces non-stress-related changes in cell function that may be critical to immunity. Preliminary analysis of locomotion in true microgravity revealed a substantial inhibition of cellular movement in Type I collagen. Thus, the rotating-wall vessel culture system provides a model for analyzing the microgravity-induced inhibition of lymphocyte locomotion and the investigation of the mechanisms related to lymphocyte movement.",Pellis NR; Goodwin TJ; Risin D; McIntyre BW; Pizzini RP; Cooper D; Baker TL; Spaulding GF,,1997,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

It not only visualizes colorful flow velocity streamlines but also quantifies the mechanical stress on cardiovascular structures; thus, it can provide the detailed inspections of the pathophysiology of diseases and predict the prognosis of cardiovascular functions. Clinical applications include the comprehensive assessment of hemodynamics and cardiac functions in echocardiography vector flow mapping (VFM), 4D flow MRI, and surgical planning as a simulation medicine in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).For evaluation of the hemodynamics, novel mathematically derived parameters obtained using measured velocity distributions are essential. Among them, the traditional and typical parameters are wall shear stress (WSS) and its related parameters. These parameters indicate the mechanical damages to endothelial cells, resulting in degenerative intimal change in vascular diseases. Apart from WSS, there are abundant parameters that describe the strength of the vortical and/or helical flow patterns. For instance, vorticity, enstrophy, and circulation indicate the rotating flow strength or power of 2D vortical flows. In addition, helicity, which is defined as the cross-linking number of the vortex filaments, indicates the 3D helical flow strength and adequately describes the turbulent flow in the aortic root in cases with complicated anatomies. For the description of turbulence caused by the diseased flow, there exist two types of parameters based on completely different concepts, namely: energy loss (EL) and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). EL is the dissipated energy with blood viscosity and evaluates the cardiac workload related to the prognosis of heart failure. TKE describes the fluctuation in kinetic energy during turbulence, which describes the severity of the diseases that cause jet flow. These parameters are based on intuitive and clear physiological concepts, and are suitable for in vivo flow measurements using inner velocity profiles.",Itatani K; Sekine T; Yamagishi M; Maeda Y; Higashitani N; Miyazaki S; Matsuda J; Takehara Y,4D flow magnetic resonance imaging; blood flow imaging; cardiac surgery; hemodynamics,2022,Magnetic resonance in medical sciences : MRMS : an official journal of Japan,Journal Article,,

Orientation involves massage of the vesicle by contractions of the turgid uterine horn and greater thickening of the vesicle at the pole with the embryo proper. Thickening of the dorsal endometrium (encroachment) especially on each side of the mesometrial attachment accounts for a guitar-pick shape of the vesicle when viewed in cross section of the uterine horn. On Days 21-40, the allantoic sac expands, and the relative size of the yolk sac diminishes highlighted by carrying of the embryo proper to the dorsal aspect of the embryonic vesicle. There, the blood vessels from the embryonic vesicle meet at the mesometrial attachment to become the beginning of the umbilical cord. At the end of the embryo stage and beginning of the fetal stage (Day 40), the umbilical cord lengthens in association with the descent of the fetus to the bottom of the allantoic sac. After unilateral fixation of twins, a natural embryo reduction process frequently (∼85%) eliminates one of the embryos. The twins are massaged by the uterine contractions, and a critical proportion of the thicker wall of the doomed embryonic vesicle is forced into the thinner wall of the survivor.

Functional factors, such as sustained end-of-range rotation of the cervical spine, may cause distortion of the vertebral artery in the suboccipital region, which may be reflected as decreased blood flow in the suboccipital and intracranial parts of the artery. A combination of such factors is likely to cause reduced blood flow to the hindbrain. It is the purpose of this review to highlight some of the factors that may compromise vertebral artery blood flow and, therefore, to provide some evidence on which to base our professional practice.",Mitchell J,,2005,Physiotherapy theory and practice,Journal Article; Review,,
rotating_wall,35472709,Blood cell distribution in small and large vessels: Effects of wall and rotating motion of red blood cells.,"A two-dimensional computer simulation of blood flow between two parallel plates as the tube was performed to understand the distribution of red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets (PLTs) according to the blood vessel size. The motion of the blood cells (BCs) was directly calculated using the particle method. The tube diameter and hematocrit were set as 20-500 µm and 0-0.4, respectively. In simulations with tank-treading (TT) RBCs under the planar Poiseuille flow, RBCs moved from the tube wall to form a cell-free layer (CFL). Then, the PLTs moved into the CFL, and the RBCs concentrated around the tube center, excluding the PLTs. By comparing the BC distribution between the Couette and Poiseuille flows, the range of the wall effect was estimated to be ≤50-100 µm at the hematocrit of 0.4. Tumbling (TB) RBCs uniformly distributed inside the tube, while forming rouleaux-like aggregates on the wall at 0.4 in hematocrit; at hematocrit ≤0.3, the TB RBCs tended to be excluded from the tube center as known to the tubular pinch effect. The mechanical interaction among the RBCs and tube wall facilitated TT motion even if the apparent shear rate was so small that an RBC in a dilute suspension would exhibit TB motion. These results indicate that the TT motion of RBCs combined with the wall effect plays a major role in forming CFL and avoiding aggregation of BCs and that TB motion helps BCs to distribute uniformly in large vessels where the shear rate is relatively low.",Tsubota KI; Namioka K,"Biomechanics; Blood flow; Particle method; Red blood cells, Platelets; Tank-treading motion; Tumbling motion",2022,Journal of biomechanics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,29524719,Morphological Parameters Related to Aneurysm Wall Enhancement in Patients with Multiple Intracranial Aneurysms.,"BACKGROUND: Vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been suggested as a potential in vivo method to detect inflammation of aneurysm wall and identify unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) at high risk for rupture. This study aims to investigate the correlation between aneurysm wall enhancement (AWE) on vessel wall MRI and rupture-related morphological parameters in patients with multiple UIAs. METHODS: Clinical data and vessel wall MRI images were reviewed in 14 patients with 30 multiple UIAs. The AWE was defined as enhancement of the aneurysm wall in postcontrast vessel wall MRI using the precontrast MRI as a reference. Morphological parameters, including aneurysm size, aspect ratio, size ratio, bottleneck factor, height-to-width ratio, nonsphericity index (NSI), and inflow angle, were measured using 3-dimensional rotation angiography. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the correlations between morphological parameters and the presence of AWE. RESULTS: Sixteen of the 30 multiple UIAs presented with AWE on vessel wall MRI. On univariate analyses, UIAs with AWE were significantly larger (P = 0.001) and had significantly higher aspect ratio (P = 0.047), size ratio (P = 0.003), bottleneck factor (P = 0.007), and NSI (P = 0.007) values. Further multivariate logistic regression showed that aneurysm size (odds ratio, 3.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-11.35; P = 0.033) and NSI (odds ratio, 3.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-11.80; P = 0.040) were independently associated with the presence of AWE in multiple UIAs. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of AWE on vessel wall MRI was significantly correlated with conventional morphological rupture risk factors in patients with multiple UIAs, which might indicate AWE as a potential radiologic predictor for UIAs with high rupture risk.",Lv N; Tang H; Chen S; Wang X; Fang Y; Karmonik C; Huang Q; Liu J,Inflammation; Intracranial aneurysm; Magnetic resonance imaging; Morphology; Rupture,2018,World neurosurgery,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,29481937,Possible Mechanism for Common Femoral Artery Occlusion with the Perclose Suture Device.,"BACKGROUND: Common femoral artery (CFA) occlusion by the Perclose suture device has been rarely reported in the literature. Authors and industry have no proposed mechanism. A review of patients who required operative repair may identify a possible mechanism for CFA occlusion. METHODS: At a single center, 2 patients were identified with CFA occlusion due to posterior CFA wall suturing. Vessel characteristics, angiographic, and intraoperative findings were reviewed. RESULTS: In both patients, the CFA diameter was >5 mm with no evidence of atherosclerotic plaque. Puncture sites by angiogram were near vessel branch points-the inferior epigastric and profunda femoris. Intraoperative findings identified posterior CFA suturing at the origin of a branch vessel as the mechanism for vessel occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: CFA occlusion by the Perclose device is the result of suture firing into the posterior CFA wall, which requires interposition of the vessel between the footplate and suture needles. The proposed mechanism is anchoring of the footplate in the origin of the branch vessel, which allows for capture of the posterior CFA wall. Technical reasons may include high or low puncture near CFA branches, less than 45° angulation of the device in relation to the CFA, and axial rotation of the device, which may allow for footplate anchoring in the branch vessel origin.",Archie M; Farley S,,2018,Annals of vascular surgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,28987020,Cardiac and haemodynamic influence on carotid artery longitudinal wall motion.,"What is the central question of this study? Carotid artery longitudinal wall motion (CALM) is a bidirectional forward and backward motion of the arterial wall; however, there is no evidence in humans for what controls CALM despite proposals for pulse pressure, left ventricular motion and shear rate. What is the main finding and its importance? Carotid artery longitudinal wall motion responses were heterogeneous when manipulating sympathetic activation and endothelium-independent vasodilatation, leading to non-significant group responses. However, individual CALM responses were associated with left ventricular rotation and shear rate. These findings are important when interpreting changes in CALM in humans with acute or chronic experimental designs. Carotid artery longitudinal wall motion (CALM) has recently attracted interest as an indicator of arterial health; however, the regulation of CALM is poorly understood. We conducted a series of studies aimed at manipulating pulse pressure (PP), left ventricular (LV) motion and carotid shear rate, which have been previously suggested to regulate various components of CALM pattern and magnitude. To determine the regulatory influences on CALM, 15 healthy men (22 ± 2 years old) were exposed to three acute interventions: the serial subtraction test (SST); the cold pressor test (CPT); and exposure to sublingual nitroglycerine (NTG). The SST elicited increases in PP (P < 0.01), apical LV rotation (P < 0.01) and carotid shear rate (P < 0.01), with no changes in CALM (P > 0.05). Likewise, the CPT elicited increases in PP (P = 0.01), basal LV rotation (P = 0.04) and carotid shear rate (P = 0.01), with no changes in CALM (P > 0.05). Conversely, exposure to NTG elicited no change in PP (P = 0.22), basal (P = 0.65) or apical LV rotation (P = 0.45), but did decrease carotid shear rate (P < 0.01), without altering CALM (P > 0.05). Considerable individual variability in CALM responses prompted further analyses where all three interventions were pooled for change scores. Changes in LV basal rotation were related to changes in systolic retrograde CALM (B = -0.025, P = 0.03), whereas changes in carotid shear rate were related to changes in diastolic CALM displacement (B = 0.0009, P = 0.01). The interventions were underpinned by relationships between CALM and both LV basal rotation and local shear rate at the individual level, indicating that cardiac and haemodynamic factors may influence CALM in humans.",Au JS; Bochnak PA; Valentino SE; Cheng JL; Stöhr EJ; MacDonald MJ,arterial wall motion; echocardiography; speckle-tracking,2018,Experimental physiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,10949994,Culture in the rotating-wall vessel affects recombinant protein production capability of two insect cell lines in different manners.,"The production of recombinant secreted alkaline phosphatase protein in virally infected insect cells was studied in shaker flask and high aspect rotating-wall vessel (HARV) culture. Two commonly used cell lines, Spodoptera frugiperda Sf-9 (Sf-9) and a nonaggregating isolate of the Trichoplusia ni BTI-Tn-5B1-4 (Tn-5B1-4) cell line, Trichoplusia ni Tn-5B1-4-NA (Tn-5B1-4-NA), were used and monitored for 120-h postinfection. Different responses to culture in the HARV were seen in the two cell lines. While the Sf-9 cell line was able to produce slightly greater amounts of recombinant protein in the HARV than in shaker flask controls, the Tn-5B1-4-NA cell line produced significantly lesser amounts in the HARV than in the shaker flasks. Both cell lines exhibited longer life spans and longer periods of protein production in HARV culture than in shaker flask culture, presumably due to lower levels of shear encountered in the HARV. The important difference was in the protein production rate responses of the two cell lines. While the protein production rates of Sf-9 cells were comparable in both HARV and shaker flask cultures, the protein production rates of Tn-5B1-4-NA cells were much lower in HARV culture than in shaker flask cultures. The conclusion is drawn that cell line-specific adaptation to the HARV strongly influences recombinant protein production.",Saarinen MA; Murhammer DW,,2000,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

Here, we reviewed the angioarchitecture, clinical characteristics, and treatment results of AVFs in these lesions. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with 27 lesions who underwent rotational angiography in our department between May 2013 and December 2019 were reviewed. We examined 20 CS AVFs, 2 clival AVFs, and 5 condylar AVFs. We divided the anatomical shunted pouches into five locations: the dorsum sellae (posteromedial of the CS), posterolateral wall of the CS, lateral wall of the CS, clivus, and condyle. We divided the AVFs into three categories: intraosseous, transitional, and nonosseous shunts. We analyzed the characteristics and treatment results. RESULTS: A total of 33 shunted pouches or points were identified in 27 lesions. The dorsum sellae (n = 16) was the most frequent location. Fourteen AVFs (88%) in the dorsum sellae were osseous (intraosseous or transitional) shunts. All AVFs in the clivus or condyle were also osseous shunts. Eleven lesions (92%) of intraosseous and all lesions of transitional shunts exhibited bilateral external carotid artery involvement as feeders. Ten lesions (83%) of intraosseous shunts were treated with selective transvenous embolization of the shunted pouch with or without additional partial embolization of the sinus. Eleven (92%) intraosseous shunts were completely occluded, and symptom resolution was achieved in all intraosseous shunts. CONCLUSION: Most of the CS AVFs with shunted pouches in the dorsum sellae and all of the AVFs in the clivus and condyle share similar characteristics.",Hiramatsu M; Sugiu K; Haruma J; Hishikawa T; Takahashi Y; Murai S; Nishi K; Yamaoka Y; Date I,Clivus; Condyle; Dorsum sellae; Osseous arteriovenous fistula; Selective embolization,2021,Neuroradiology,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,36372884,4D flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance recovery profiles following pulmonary endarterectomy in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.,"BACKGROUND: Four-dimensional flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (4D flow CMR) allows comprehensive assessment of pulmonary artery (PA) flow dynamics. Few studies have characterized longitudinal changes in pulmonary flow dynamics and right ventricular (RV) recovery following a pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) for patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). This can provide novel insights of RV and PA dynamics during recovery. We investigated the longitudinal trajectory of 4D flow metrics following a PEA including velocity, vorticity, helicity, and PA vessel wall stiffness. METHODS: Twenty patients with CTEPH underwent pre-PEA and &gt; 6 months post-PEA CMR imaging including 4D flow CMR; right heart catheter measurements were performed in 18 of these patients. We developed a semi-automated pipeline to extract integrated 4D flow-derived main, left, and right PA (MPA, LPA, RPA) volumes, velocity flow profiles, and secondary flow profiles. We focused on secondary flow metrics of vorticity, volume fraction of positive helicity (clockwise rotation), and the helical flow index (HFI) that measures helicity intensity. RESULTS: Mean PA pressures (mPAP), total pulmonary resistance (TPR), and normalized RV end-systolic volume (RVESV) decreased significantly post-PEA (P &lt; 0.002). 4D flow-derived PA volumes decreased (P &lt; 0.001) and stiffness, velocity, and vorticity increased (P &lt; 0.01) post-PEA. Longitudinal improvements from pre- to post-PEA in mPAP were associated with longitudinal decreases in MPA area (r = 0.68, P = 0.002). Longitudinal improvements in TPR were associated with longitudinal increases in the maximum RPA HFI (r=-0.85, P &lt; 0.001). Longitudinal improvements in RVESV were associated with longitudinal decreases in MPA fraction of positive helicity (r = 0.75, P = 0.003) and minimum MPA HFI (r=-0.72, P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: We developed a semi-automated pipeline for analyzing 4D flow metrics of vessel stiffness and flow profiles. PEA was associated with changes in 4D flow metrics of PA flow profiles and vessel stiffness. Longitudinal analysis revealed that PA helicity was associated with pulmonary remodeling and RV reverse remodeling following a PEA.",Dong ML; Azarine A; Haddad F; Amsallem M; Kim YW; Yang W; Fadel E; Aubrege L; Loecher M; Ennis D; Pavec JL; Vignon-Clementel I; Feinstein JA; Mercier O; Marsden AL,4D flow magnetic resonance; Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; Pulmonary endarterectomy,2022,Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",ANR-15-RHUS-0002/Agence Nationale de la Recherche/; DGE-1656518/National Science Foundation/,

CASE REPORT: A 35-year-old primigravida with a previous surgical history of laparoscopic myomectomy underwent elective cesarean section at 39 weeks and 2 days of gestation. During surgery, there were severe pelvic adhesions and engorged vessels on the anterior wall. Considering safety, we rotated the uterus 180 degrees and made a lower transverse incision on the posterior wall. The infant was healthy and the patient had no complications. CONCLUSIONS: A low transverse incision in the posterior uterine wall is safe and effective when the incision of the anterior wall encounters a dilemma, especially in patients with severe pelvic adhesions. We recommended this approach should be done in selected cases.",Tan X; Xing A; Tong A,Cesarean section; adhesion; posterior wall; rotation,2023,The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,,

Herein, we evaluated effects of rotating bioreactor culture on the extracellular matrix production and proliferation of human annulus fibrosus (AF) cells. AF cells were embedded into alginate beads, and then cultured up to 3 weeks in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor or a static vessel. By real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, expression of aggrecan, collagen type I and type II, and collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase II was remarkably elevated, whereas expression of matrix metalloproteinase 3 and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 was significantly decreased under bioreactor. Biochemical analysis revealed that the levels of the whole cell-associated proteoglycan and collagen were approximately five- and twofolds in rotating bioreactor, respectively, compared to those in static culture. Moreover, AF cell proliferation was augmented in rotating bioreactor. DNA contents were threefolds higher in rotating bioreactor than that in static culture. Expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen was robustly enhanced in rotating bioreactor as early as 1 week. Our findings suggested that rotating bioreactor culture would be an effective technique for expansion of human annulus cells for tissue engineering driven treatment of disc degeneration.",Yang X; Wang D; Hao J; Gong M; Arlet V; Balian G; Shen FH; Li XJ,,2011,Tissue engineering.

The burst pressure of the scaffold-free TEBV was above 200 mmHg after three weeks of sequential culture in a rotating wall bioreactor and perfusion at 6.8 dynes/cm(2). The interwoven organization of the cell layers and extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) formation of the hMSC-based TEBV resembled that of native blood vessels. The TEBV exhibited flow-mediated vasodilation, vasoconstriction after exposure to 1 μM phenylephrine and released nitric oxide in a manner similar to that of porcine femoral vein.

rotating_wall,2099035,New mechanical devices for treatment of coronary artery disease.,"Percutaneous high-speed coronary rotablation allows to remove arterio-sclerotic material from the vessel wall. A diamond-coated (15-30 microns) brass burr drill fastened to a flexible drive shaft rotating and tracking along a drill coaxial guide wire is used. The turbine rotates the drive shaft at 150,000-190,000 rpm. High-frequency rotational angioplasty was successful in 27 of 28 patients, but in about 34% additional PTCA was necessary. Only one patient went to bypass surgery, and myocardial infarction (CK less than 150 u/l) occurred in only one of 28 patients. No vessel perforation was observed. All vessels were open at 24 h control. The restenosis rate was not increased. The main indication for high-speed rotational angioplasty seems to be rigid sclerotic lesions that cannot be passed by a conventional balloon catheter. Whether restenosis rate can be reduced by this method will be judged in future studies. In order to avoid acute complications of PTCA and to reduce restenosis rate, coronary stents were developed. Self-expandable and balloon-expandable stents are available. It could be demonstrated that these stents can be used as a bail-out system and can block elastic recoil of coronary arteries. The major remaining problem is that of subacute closure of coronary vessels. In order to prevent this, treatment with coumarine, acetylsalicylic acid, and dipyridamol is necessary. Coronary stents can be successfully delivered in more than 90% of the patients, as demonstrated by a cooperative study. In a highly selective patient group using single stents, restenosis rate measured 15%, but was higher in patients with multiple stents.",Erbel R; Haude M; Dietz U; Rupprecht HJ; Zotz R; Meyer J,,1990,Zeitschrift fur Kardiologie,Comparative Study; Journal Article; Review,,
rotating_wall,36271078,Reduced rotational flows enable the translation of surface-rolling microrobots in confined spaces.,"Biological microorganisms overcome the Brownian motion at low Reynolds numbers by utilizing symmetry-breaking mechanisms. Inspired by them, various microrobot locomotion methods have been developed at the microscale by breaking the hydrodynamic symmetry. Although the boundary effects have been extensively studied for microswimmers and employed for surface-rolling microrobots, the behavior of microrobots in the proximity of multiple wall-based ""confinement"" is yet to be elucidated. Here, we study the confinement effect on the motion of surface-rolling microrobots. Our experiments demonstrate that the locomotion efficiency of spherical microrollers drastically decreases in confined spaces due to out-of-plane rotational flows generated during locomotion. Hence, a slender microroller design, generating smaller rotational flows, is shown to outperform spherical microrollers in confined spaces. Our results elucidate the underlying physics of surface rolling-based locomotion in confined spaces and present a design strategy with optimal flow generation for efficient propulsion in such areas, including blood vessels and microchannels.",Bozuyuk U; Aghakhani A; Alapan Y; Yunusa M; Wrede P; Sitti M,,2022,Nature communications,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,18453988,Branch-based conjoined perforator flaps.,"BACKGROUND: An extremely large skin flap encompassing multiple flap territories that have a common physical boundary but with each retaining its unique vascular supply would be called a conjoined flap. If the subfascial and/or axial vascular branches to each territory in turn ultimately supply a direct or indirect perforator, such a combination raised without muscle or other tissue intermediary would specifically be defined as a branch-based conjoined perforator flap. METHODS: A retrospective review of 522 cutaneous flaps in the author's experience over the past 5 years identified the use of five branch-based conjoined perforator free flaps and four local rotation flaps. Unique technical considerations and the attributes of the multiple donor sites for these conjoined flaps were further scrutinized. RESULTS: All nine branch-based conjoined perforator flaps were successfully transferred without any major complications. The preferred donor site was equally distributed among the anterior thigh, trunk, and lower abdomen. On three occasions, the subfascial branches ultimately arose from a common ""mother"" vessel that required at the most only a single arterial and venous microanastomosis. Two local flaps had totally independent branches to each territory, so that a single microanastomosis to the detached pedicle essentially supercharged the flap. For all free flaps with independent branches, the branch of one territory was always anastomosed to the other according to the mosaic flap principle, so that again only a single arterial microanastomosis was required at the recipient site. CONCLUSION: Multiple direct or indirect perforator flaps from adjacent territories can be reliably combined as conjoined flaps based on sizable subfascial and/or axial vascular branches.",Hallock GG,,2008,Plastic and reconstructive surgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,,

Along with other mechanical stimuli like vessel wall stretching or hydrostatic blood pressure, this shear stress modulates the endothelial cell function, morphology and gene expression. Here, we describe our improved cone-and-plate reactor that applies up to 10 dyn/cm(2) uniform wall shear stress on a defined, ring-shaped region on a culture dish. At the same time, a hydrostatic pressure of up to 195 mmHg can be applied by increasing the atmospheric pressure in the incubator box. Gas composition can be controlled additionally, used for maintaining CO2-homeostasis or inducing hypoxic conditions. For better comparability, six cone-and-plate systems can be used at the same time at different rotational velocities. The effects on cell morphology, cytoskeleton and cell alignment can be monitored during application using a laser scanning microscope.

rotating_wall,35180648,Engineering in-plane mechanics of electrospun polyurethane scaffolds for cardiovascular tissue applications.,"Effective cardiovascular tissue surrogates require high control of scaffold structural and mechanical features to match native tissue properties, which are dependent on tissue-specific mechanics, function heterogenicity, and morphology. Bridging scaffold processing variables with native tissue properties is recognized as a priority for advancing biomechanical performance of biomedical materials and, when translated to the clinical practice, their efficacy. Accordingly, this study selected electrospinning on a rotating cylindrical target as an apparatus of broad application and mapped the relationship between key processing variables and scaffold mechanics and structure. This information was combined with mechanical anisotropy ranges of interest for the three main categories of tissue surrogated in cardiovascular tissue engineering: heart valve leaflets, ventricle wall, and large diameter blood vessels. Specifically, three processing variables have been considered: the rotational velocity and the rastering velocity of the mandrel and the dry (single nozzle - polymer only) vs wet (double nozzle - polymer plus phosphate buffer saline solution) fabrication configuration. While the dry configuration is generally utilized to obtain micro-fiber based polymeric mats, the wet fabrication is representative of processing conditions utilized to incorporate cells, growth factors, or micro-particles within the fibrous scaffold matrix. Dry and wet processed electrospun mats were fabricated with tangential and rastering velocities within the 0.3-9.0 m/s and 0.16-8 cm/s range respectively. Biaxial mechanics, fiber network, and pore micro-architectures were measured for each combination of velocities and for each fabrication modality (dry and wet). Results allowed identification of the precise combination of rotational and rastering velocities, for both dry and wet conditions, that is able to recapitulate the native cardiovascular tissue anisotropy ratio.

rotating_wall,28890056,Giant Chest Wall Arteriovenous Malformation: A Case Report and Literature Review.,"BACKGROUND: We present an interesting case of a 55-year-old male with a large left chest mass after significant cutaneous bleeding. Computed tomography angiogram of the chest revealed arteriovenous malformation with blood supply from sub-branches of the left subclavian artery, left internal mammary artery, and left external carotid artery. Measuring 5.0 × 14.0 × 10.8 cm, the mass extended superior to the clavicle and inferior to the third rib with medial and lateral borders at the level of the clavicular head and coracoid, respectively. METHODS: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are characterized by abnormal connections between arteries and veins which bypass the capillary system. Often small and asymptomatic, large AVMs can be painful, prone to bleeding and, if large enough, interfere with activities of daily living. While described involving various parts of the body, most notably in the central nervous system, there is a paucity of literature involving chest wall AVMs. RESULTS: Using a staged, multidisciplinary approach, treatment began with an endovascular exclusion of the arterial blood supply, which involved a combination of coil embolization and stent exclusion of feeder vessels. Two days postembolization, the patient underwent an en bloc resection of affected portion of his chest wall. Reconstruction was completed with a combination rotational flap and split-thickness skin graft. Following the procedures, the patient had an uncomplicated recovery. Three years following procedure, he has no signs of recurrence of his AV malformation. CONCLUSION: Surgical planning and indications for giant arteriovenous malformations remains a unique and difficult problem. The complex anatomy and extreme rarity of a chest wall AVM requires a multidisciplinary staged approach but can be treated with a multistage, multidisciplinary surgical approach with satisfactory and long-lasting results.",McCarthy C; Deb S; Maqusi S; Gierman J,,2018,Annals of vascular surgery,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,,
rotating_wall,33223973,Incidence and Mechanisms of Coronary Perforations during Rotational Atherectomy in Modern Practice.,"OBJECTIVE: Heavy calcifications remain formidable challenges to PCI, even for well-experienced operators. However, rotational atherectomy (RA)-induced coronary perforations (CPs) still could not be obviated. This study was to explore incidence and mechanisms of RA-induced CP in real-world practice. Knowing why CPs occur in RA should help operators avert such mishaps. METHOD: Patients who received coronary RA from April 2010 to December 2019 with keywords related to perforations were retrieved from database. The procedure details, angiography, and clinical information were reviewed in detail. RESULTS: A total of 479 RAs were performed with 11 perforations in 10 procedures among 9 patients documented. The incidence of RA-induced CP was 2.1%. The RA vessels were distributed in different territories, including first diagonal branch. Most CPs could be treated conservatively, but prolonged profound shock predisposed to poor outcome. CPs caused by rotawire tip occurred in 18.2% of cases, inappropriately sized burrs in 18.2% of cases, and rotawire damage with subsequent transection and perforation in another 18.2% of cases. A total of 5 (45.5%) perforations were caused by unintended and unnoticed bias cutting into noncalcified plaques (4, 36.4%) or through calcified vessel wall (1, 9.1%). The mechanisms for certain CPs were unique and illustrated in diagrams. CONCLUSION: CPs due to RA occur in certain percentage of patients. The mechanisms for CPs are diverse. Wire damage with subsequent transection could occur due to inappropriately repetitive burr stress on the wire body. A significant portion was due to unintended and unnoticed bias cutting into noncalcified plaque or through calcified vessel wall.",Wang YH; Chen WJ; Chen YW; Lai CH; Su CS; Chang WC; Wang CY; Liang KW; Liu TJ; Lee WL,,2020,Journal of interventional cardiology,Journal Article,,

Studying atrial flutter mechanisms by mapping and entrainment.,"Endocardial mapping has led to a detailed knowledge of reentry mechanisms in atrial flutter. Multipolar and deflecting tip catheters allow recording local electrograms from multiple areas of the right atrium, and from the coronary sinus. In common flutter, with the typical ""sawtooth"" pattern, there is circular activation of the right atrium in a ""counterclockwise"" direction, descending in the anterior and lateral walls, and ascending in the septum and posterior wall. Superior and inferior vena cava, linked by a ""line"" of functional block in the posterolateral wall, make the central obstacle for circular activation. The cranial and caudal turning points are the atrial ""roof,"" and the isthmus between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve. Complex conduction patterns, probably including slow conduction are detectable in the low septal area, around the coronary sinus. Atypical flutter, without the sharp negative deflections of common flutter, sometimes shows circular activation in the right atrium, rotating in the opposite direction of common flutter (clockwise). Other atypical flutters show no circular right atrial activation, and only partial data from coronary sinus activation, combined with the response to atrial stimulation (entrainment) allow the diagnosis of left atrial reentry, without a precise delimitation of the circuits. In patients having undergone cardiac surgery, atypical flutter may be based on reentry around surgical scars. To our knowledge, the mechanism of type II flutter has not been disclosed in humans.",Cosio FG; Arribas F; López-Gil M; Palacios J,,1996,Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,Journal Article; Review,,
rotating_wall,16878311,Automatic vessel wall contour detection and quantification of wall thickness in in-vivo MR images of the human aorta.,"PURPOSE: To develop an automated technique to trace the contours of the lumen and outer boundary of the aortic wall, and measure aortic wall thickness in axial MR images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The algorithm uses prior knowledge of vessel wall morphology. A geometrical model (ellipse) is deformed, translated and rotated to obtain a rough approximation of the contours. Model-matching is based on image gradient measurements. To enhance edges, the images were preprocessed using gray-level stretching. Refinement is performed by means of dynamic programming. Wall thickness is computed by measuring the distance between inner and outer contour of the aortic wall. RESULTS: The algorithm has been tested on high-resolution axial MR images from 28 human subjects of the descending thoracic aorta. The results demonstrate: High correspondence between automatic and manual area measurements: lumen (r = 0.99), outer (r = 0.96), and wall thickness (r = 0.85). CONCLUSION: Though further optimization is required, our algorithm is a powerful tool to automatically draw the boundaries of the aortic wall and measure aortic wall thickness in aortic wall devoid of major lesions.

rotating_wall,33830314,Prediction of the debulking effect of rotational atherectomy using optical frequency domain imaging.,"Whether predicting the rotational atherectomy (RA) effect based on the position of optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) is accurate remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive accuracy of OFDI in identifying RA location and area. Twenty-five patients who underwent RA with OFDI were included. On pre-RA OFDI images, a circle with the dimension of a Rota burr was drawn at the center of the OFDI catheter. The area where the circle overlapped with the vessel wall was defined as the predicted ablation area (P-area), and the actual ablated area (A-area) was measured. The predictive accuracy of OFDI was evaluated as follows: overlapped ablation area (O-area: overlapping P- and A-areas) divided by P-area = %Correct-area, and A-area - O-area divided by A-area = %Error-area. Cross-sections were separated into four categories based on the median values of %Correct- and %Error-area. Among 334 cross-sections, RA effects were confirmed in the predicted location in 87% of them. The median %Correct- and %Error-areas were 43.1% and 64.2%, respectively. Floppy wire, narrow lumen area, OFDI catheter close to the intima, and large arc of calcium were independently associated with good prediction (high %Correct-/low %Error-areas). Non-left anterior descending lesions, OFDI catheter far from the wire, and OFDI catheter and wire far from the intima were associated with irrelevant ablation (low %Correct-/ high %Error-areas). The accuracy of the OFDI-based predictions for RA effects was acceptable with regard to location, but not high with regard to area. Wire types, target vessels, and OFDI catheter and wire positions are important determinants for accurately predicting RA effect using pre-procedural OFDI.",Tanimura K; Otake H; Kawamori H; Toba T; Nagasawa A; Sugizaki Y; Takeshige R; Nakano S; Matsuoka Y; Takahashi Y; Fukuyama Y; Hirata KI,Debulking effect; Optical frequency domain imaging; Prediction; Rotational atherectomy,2021,Heart and vessels,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,10940861,The fluid dynamic and shear environment in the NASA/JSC rotating-wall perfused-vessel bioreactor.,"The rotating-wall perfused-vessel (RWPV) bioreactor, used for both microgravity and Earth-based cell science experiments, is characterized in terms of the fluid dynamic and fluid shear stress environment. A numerical model of the flow field is developed and verified with laser Doppler velocimeter measurements. The effects of changes in operating conditions, including rotation rates and fluid perfusion rates, are investigated with the numerical model. The operating conditions typically used for ground-based experiments (equal rotation of the inner and outer cylinders) leads to flow patterns with relatively poor mass distribution characteristics. Approximately 50% of the inlet-perfused fluid bypasses the bulk of the fluid volume and flows to the perfusion exit. For operating conditions typical in microgravity, small differential rotation rates between the inner and outer cylinders lead to greatly improved flow distribution patterns and very low fluid shear stress levels over a large percentage of the fluid volume. Differences in flow patterns for the different operating conditions are explored. Large differences in the hydrodynamic environments for operating conditions typical of true microgravity and ground-based ""microgravity simulations"" are demonstrated.",Begley CM; Kleis SJ,,2000,Biotechnology and bioengineering,Journal Article,,

Quantitative real-time assessment of the kinetics of cell-cell aggregation in RWVs can yield mechanistic information about the initial steps leading to the assembly of individual cells into tissue-like constructs. In our imaging system, fluorescently labeled cells suspended in a HARV-type RWV were irradiated by a laser-beam. Emission was recorded by a camera mounted at 90 degrees to the excitation plane. Using macro lenses, the system identified approximately 5 microm particles from a 5 cm working distance, distinguished aggregated 20 microm microspheres from larger (45 and 90 microm) microspheres, and plotted local trajectories of microspheres and cells. Sizes of PC12 cells assessed by our system matched conventional measurements. We validated the system's ability to follow HepG2 and PC12 aggregation in real time over 24h of RWV culture. Taken together, our system provides the means to measure and analyze in real time the processes that lead to the 3D tissue-like assembly of diverse cell types into spheroids. Future studies include development of intelligent feedback algorithms, allowing automatic control over RWV rotational speed required to maintain aggregating cells and nascent tissue in continual free fall.",Manley P; Lelkes PI,,2006,Journal of biotechnology,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Validation Study",,

Results on a swine angiogenesis model.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In this study we tested the effect of antiangiogenics on a swine angiogenesis model that shares some brain AVM histological characteristics. The objective was to determine bevacizumab effects on retia volumes and on vessels' wall. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen pigs were divided into 3 groups: Five animals served as controls (group A), 5 animals underwent endovascular left external and common carotid artery occlusion (group B) and 5 animals underwent the same procedure and had an intra-arterial in-situ injection of bevacizumab (groupC) 2 months after the occlusion. A DSA associated with 3D-rotational angiography was performed at day 0 and at 3 months in all groups in order to measure rete mirabile volumes. The animals were sacrificed at 3 months and the retia were harvested for pathological and immunohistochemistry examinations. RESULTS: All VEGF-A receptors were blocked at the site of injection and there was a local enhanced endothelial proliferation and apoptosis. The volume of the retia remained unchanged after the bevacizumab injection. Retia vessels presented comparable media thickness, higher endothelial proliferation and apoptosis after the anti-VEGF injection. CONCLUSION: A single in-situ injection of bevacizumab in this swine angiogenesis model showed no change in retia volume and an extensive blockage of VEGF receptors at the site of injection one month later. Rete mirabile vessels presented comparable media thickness, higher endothelial proliferation and apoptosis after the anti-VEGF injection, suggesting that bevacizumab antiangiogenic effect does not fragilize vessel wall. More studies are needed to confirm these preliminary insights of in-situ antiangiogenic effect on vascular malformations.",Papagiannaki C; Yardin C; Iosif C; Couquet C; Clarençon F; Mounayer C,Animal model; Arteriovenous malformations; Bevacizumab; Vessel wall,2021,Journal of neuroradiology = Journal de neuroradiologie,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,28181412,Aligned Nanofibrous Cell-Derived Extracellular Matrix for Anisotropic Vascular Graft Construction.,"There is a large demand for tissue engineered vascular grafts for the application of vascular reconstruction surgery or in vitro drug screening tissue model. The extracellular matrix (ECM) composition along with the structural and mechanical anisotropy of native blood vessels is critical to their functional performance. The objective of this study is to develop a biomimetic vascular graft recapitulating the anisotropic features of native blood vessels by employing nanofibrous aligned fibroblast-derived ECM and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The nanotopographic cues of aligned ECM direct the initial cell orientation. The subsequent maturation under circumferential stress generated by a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor further promotes anisotropic structural and mechanical properties in the graft. The circumferential tensile strength is significantly higher than longitudinal strength in bioreactor samples. Expression of smooth muscle cell specific genes, α-smooth muscle actin and calponin, in hMSCs is greatly enhanced in bioreactor samples without any biochemical stimulation. In addition, employment of premade ECM and RWV bioreactor significantly reduces the graft fabrication time to three weeks. Mimicking the ECM composition, cell phenotype, structural and mechanical anisotropy, the vascular graft presented in this study is promising for vascular reconstruction surgery or in vitro tissue model applications.",Xing Q; Qian Z; Tahtinen M; Yap AH; Yates K; Zhao F,anisotropic vascular grafts; extracellular matrix nanofibers; human mesenchymal stem cells; myogenic phenotype; rotating wall vessel bioreactor,2017,Advanced healthcare materials,Journal Article,R15 CA202656/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R15 HL115521/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,35271411,Impact of altered vena cava flow rates on right atrium flow characteristics.,"The right atrium (RA) combines the superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) flows. Treatments like extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and hemodialysis by catheter alter IVC/SVC flows. Here we assess how altered IVC/SVC flow contributions impact RA flow. Four healthy volunteers were imaged with computerized tomography (CT), reconstructed and combined into a patient-averaged model. Large eddy simulations (LESs) were performed for a range of IVC/SVC flow contributions (30%-70% each, increments of 5%) and common flow metrics were recorded. Model sensitivity to reconstruction domain extent, constant/pulsatile inlets, and hematocrit was also assessed. Consistent with literature, a single vortex occupied the central RA across all flowrates with a smaller counter-rotating vortex, not previously reported, in the auricle. Vena cava flow was highly helical. RA turbulent kinetic energy (TKE; P = 0.027) and time-averaged wall shear stress (WSS; P < 0.001) increased with SVC flow. WSS was lower in the auricle (2 Pa, P < 0.001). WSS in the vena cava was equal at IVC/SVC = 65/35%. The model was highly sensitive to the reconstruction domain with cropped geometries lacking helicity in the venae cavae, altering the RA flow. The RA flow was not significantly affected by constant inlets or hematocrit. The commonly reported vortex in in the central RA is confirmed; however, a new, smaller vortex was also recorded in the auricle. When IVC flow dominates, as is normal, TKE in the RA is reduced and WSS in the venae cavae equalize. Significant helicity exists in the vena cava, as a result of distal geometry and this geometry appears crucial to accurately simulating RA flow.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Right atrium turbulent kinetic energy increases as the proportion of flow entering from the superior vena cava is increased. Although the commonly reported large right atrium vortex was confirmed across all flow scenarios, a new smaller vortex is observed in the right auricle. The caval veins exhibit highly helical flow and this appears to be the result of distal venous morphology.",Parker LP; Svensson Marcial A; Brismar TB; Broman LM; Prahl Wittberg L,basic science research; computerized tomography (CT); hemodynamics; right atrium; vena cava,2022,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HMT2018/Stockholm Region/,

The cell density, pH and osmolality of the culture medium in the two culture systems were measured every 24h. Flow cytometric assay for CD34+ cells was carried out at 0, 144 and 197 h and methylcellulose colony assays were performed at 0, 72, 144 and 197 h. The pH and osmolality of the medium in the two culture systems were maintained in the proper ranges for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors culture. The RWV bioreactor, combined with a cell-dilution feeding protocol, was efficient to expand UCB MNCs. At the end of 200 h culture, the total cell number was multiplied by 435.5+/-87.6 times, and CD34+ cells 32.7+/-15.6 times, and colony-forming units of granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) 21.7+/-4.9 times. While in T-flasks, however, total cells density changed mildly, CD34+ cells and CFU-GM decreased in number. It is demonstrated that the RWV bioreactor can provide a better environment for UCB MNCs expansion, enhance the contact between HSCs and accessory cells and make the utilization of cytokines more effective than T-flask.",Liu Y; Liu T; Fan X; Ma X; Cui Z,,2006,Journal of biotechnology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,28112186,Improvement of hemodynamic performance using novel helical flow vena cava filter design.,"We propose a vena cava filter in which helical flow is created in the filter's working zone to minimize filter blockage by trapped clots and facilitate the lysis of trapped clots. To validate this new design, we compared five helical flow inducers with different thread pitches in terms of blood flow patterns in the filter. The vena cava was reconstructed based on computed tomography images. Both the numerical simulation and in vitro experiment revealed that the helical flow inducer can effectively create a helical flow in the vessel, thereby subduing the filter structure's adverse disruption to blood flow, and increasing flow-induced shear stress in the filter center. In addition, the smaller thread pitch helical flow inducer reduced the oscillating shear index and relative residence time on the vessel wall. Moreover, we observed that the helical flow inducer in the vena cava could induce flow rotation both in clockwise and counterclockwise directions. In conclusion, the new design of the filter with the smaller thread pitch inducer is advantageous over the traditional filter in terms of improving local hemodynamics, which may reduce thrombosis build-up after deployment.",Chen Y; Zhang P; Deng X; Fan Y; Xing Y; Xing N,,2017,Scientific reports,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,27500889,Development of a Multicellular Three-dimensional Organotypic Model of the Human Intestinal Mucosa Grown Under Microgravity.,"Because cells growing in a three-dimensional (3-D) environment have the potential to bridge many gaps of cell cultivation in 2-D environments (e.g., flasks or dishes). In fact, it is widely recognized that cells grown in flasks or dishes tend to de-differentiate and lose specialized features of the tissues from which they were derived. Currently, there are mainly two types of 3-D culture systems where the cells are seeded into scaffolds mimicking the native extracellular matrix (ECM): (a) static models and (b) models using bioreactors. The first breakthrough was the static 3-D models. 3-D models using bioreactors such as the rotating-wall-vessel (RWV) bioreactors are a more recent development. The original concept of the RWV bioreactors was developed at NASA's Johnson Space Center in the early 1990s and is believed to overcome the limitations of static models such as the development of hypoxic, necrotic cores. The RWV bioreactors might circumvent this problem by providing fluid dynamics that allow the efficient diffusion of nutrients and oxygen. These bioreactors consist of a rotator base that serves to support and rotate two different formats of culture vessels that differ by their aeration source type: (1) Slow Turning Lateral Vessels (STLVs) with a co-axial oxygenator in the center, or (2) High Aspect Ratio Vessels (HARVs) with oxygenation via a flat, silicone rubber gas transfer membrane. These vessels allow efficient gas transfer while avoiding bubble formation and consequent turbulence. These conditions result in laminar flow and minimal shear force that models reduced gravity (microgravity) inside the culture vessel. Here we describe the development of a multicellular 3-D organotypic model of the human intestinal mucosa composed of an intestinal epithelial cell line and primary human lymphocytes, endothelial cells and fibroblasts cultured under microgravity provided by the RWV bioreactor.",Salerno-Goncalves R; Fasano A; Sztein MB,,2016,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,Journal Article; Video-Audio Media,R01 AI036525/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; R01 DK048373/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States; U19 AI082655/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,10654878,Rotary cell culture system (RCCS): a new method for cultivating hepatocytes on microcarriers.,"The Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) is a new technology for growing anchorage dependent or suspension cells in the laboratory. The RCCS is a horizontally rotated, bubble free disposable culture vessel with diffusion gas exchange. The system provides a reproducible, complex 3D in vitro culture system with large cell masses. During cell growing the rotation speed can be adjusted to compensate for increased sedimentation rates. The unique environment of low shear forces, high mass transfer, and microgravity, provides very good cultivating conditions for many cell types, cell aggregates or tissue particles in a standard tissue culture laboratory. The system enables to culture HepG2 cells on Cytodex 3 microcarriers (mcs) to high densities. We inoculated 2 x 10(5)/ml HepG2 cells and 200 mg Cytodex 3 mcs in 50 ml Williams E medium (incl. 10% FCS) allowing them to attach to the mcs in the rotating vessel (rotation rate 14-20 rpm). HepG2 cells readily attached to the mcs while the vessel was rotating. Attachment of HepG2 to the mcs was about 50% after 24 hrs and 100 % within 48 hrs. After 72 hrs of rotary culturing small aggregates of Hep G2 on mcs were built. HepG2 cells and the aggregates rotated with the vessel and did not settle within the vessel or collide with the wall of the vessel. We conclude that this new RCCS is an excellent technology for culturing HepG2 cells on Cytodex 3 mcs. The system is easy to handle and enables to culture anchorage dependent cells to high densities in a short period.",Mitteregger R; Vogt G; Rossmanith E; Falkenhagen D,,1999,The International journal of artificial organs,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,20627048,[A three-dimensional quantitative measurement related to sigmoid sinus by using multi-slices spiral CT].,"OBJECTIVE: To provide a valuable imaging anatomic method for operation of the posterior transpetrosal approach and accurate positioning among relative structures in order to reduce the incidence of surgical complications. METHODS: The clinical information of 119 adult cases (238 sides) was analyzed. All the cases underwent 16 layer helix CT scanning and three-dimensional image reconstruction of skull base without a skull base disease. Axial and coronal images were reconstructed using multiplanar reconstruction technique of ADW 4.2 workstation, and the anatomic objective structure were displayed by rotating imaging slices. The data were analyzed in statistically and compared with the published cadaver data. RESULTS: Quantitative measurement of anatomic structure was shown as below: The distance of width of sigmoid sinus was (11.14 + or - 2.13) mm, the distance of depth of sigmoid sinus was (6.04 + or - 1.67) mm; the distance from the lateral wall of sigmoid sinus to the surface of mastoid process was (9.74 + or - 2.95) mm; the distance from the anterior wall of sigmoid sinus to the posterior wall of external auditory meatus was (12.98 + or - 2.71) mm; the distance from the most posterior portion of the posterior semicircular canal to the anterior wall of sigmoid sinus was (9.87 + or - 2.60) mm; the distance from the most posterior portion of the posterior semicircular canal to the posterior pyramidal wall was (3.18 + or - 1.30) mm; the distance from the posterior extremity of long axis of the lateral semicircular canal to the anterior wall of sigmoid sinus was (13.17 + or - 2.59) mm; the distance from the posterior extremity of long axis of the lateral semicircular canal to the posterior pyramidal wall was (5.46 + or - 1.38) mm; the vertical distance from the lateral semicircular canal to the jugular bulb was (6.69 + or - 3.08) mm; and the distance from the vertical portion of facial nerve to the jugular bulb was (5.32 + or - 2.13) mm. Statistically, there were no significant differences between imaging quantitative measurement and published cadaver data. However, the measurement result, included the distance from the lateral wall of sigmoid sinus to the surface of mastoid process and the distance from the lateral semicircular canal to the jugular bulb as well as the distance from the vertical portion of facial nerve to the jugular bulb, were found a positively correlated to the distance from the anterior wall of sigmoid sinus to the posterior wall of external auditory meatus (r value was 0.284, 0.145, 0.208, respectively, all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The result of three-dimensional quantitative measurement by using multiplanar reconstruction technique of 16 layer spiral CT could represent a real distance of anatomic structures. The reconstruction of spiral CT images could display a anatomic feature of temporal bone accurately, and it may provide a valuable method for surgical approach and accurate positioning of relative structure in operation. As the location of sigmoid sinus moving forward, the lateral shift of it may occur more easily and the jugular bulb become closer to the vertical portion of facial nerve, while the extension of anterior location in sigmoid sinus should be a positively correlated to the height of jugular bulb.",Xing WW; Zhang LC; Chen HY; Gu JC,,2010,Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,33760290,Left atrial thickness and acute thermal injury in patients undergoing ablation for atrial fibrillation: Laser versus radiofrequency energies.,"INTRODUCTION: Thermally induced cardiac lesions result in necrosis, edema, and inflammation. This tissue change may be seen with ultrasound. In this study, we sought to use intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) to evaluate pulmonary vein tissue morphology and assess the acute tissue changes that occur following radiofrequency (RF) or laser ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with AF underwent pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) using irrigated RF or laser balloon. Pre- and post-ablation ICE imaging was performed from within each pulmonary vein (PV). At least 10 transverse imaging planes per PV were evaluated and each plane was divided into eight segments. The PV/atrial wall thickness and the luminal area were measured at each segment. Twenty-seven patients underwent PVI (15 with laser, 12 with RF). Ninety-eight pulmonary veins were analyzed (58 PVs laser; 40 PVs RF). At baseline, there were no regional differences in PV wall thickness in the right-sided veins. The anterior regions of left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV) and left inferior pulmonary vein (LIPV) were significantly thicker compared with the posterior and inferior regions (p < .01). Post-ablation, PV wall thickness in RF group increased 24.1% interquartile range (IQR) (17.2%-36.7%) compared with 1.2% IQR (0.4%-8.9%) in laser group, p = .004. In all PVs, RF ablation resulted in significantly greater percent increase in wall thickness compared with laser. Additionally, RF resulted in more variable changes in regional PV wall thickness; with more increases in wall thickness in anterior versus posterior LSPV (75.4 ± 58.5% vs. 46.8 ± 55.6%, p < .01), anterior versus posterior right superior pulmonary vein (RSPV) (62.9 ± 63.9% vs. 44.6 ± 51.7%, p < .05), and superior versus inferior RSPV (69.1 ± 45.4% vs. 35.9 ± 45%, p < .05). There were no significant regional differences in PV wall thickness changes for the laser group. CONCLUSIONS: Rotational ICE can be used to measure acute tissue changes with ablation. Regional variability in baseline wall thickness was nonuniformly present in PVs. Acute tissue changes occurred immediately post-ablation.

rotating_wall,34410844,Case Studies in Physiology: Using premature ventricular contractions to understand the regulation of carotid artery longitudinal wall motion.,"Recent observations have identified a distinct longitudinal motion pattern of the common carotid artery, where the wall oscillates along its length both with (anterograde) and against (retrograde) the direction of blood flow. The regulation of the longitudinal pattern remains largely undetermined, in part due to difficulty uncoupling local pressure and flow stimuli from upstream energy sources. In this case study of a 29-yr-old male, we examine the regulation of longitudinal wall motion from the perspective of spontaneous premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). With respect to the pre-PVC beat, during the PVC, there was an 81% reduction in carotid blood velocity (96.8 to 18.4 cm/s), a 69% reduction in pulse pressure (58 to 18 mmHg), and a 59% reduction in apical left ventricular (LV) rotation (6.9 to 2.8°) as a result of reduced LV filling time. During this time, anterograde longitudinal wall motion was unchanged (0.06 mm), whereas retrograde motion was reduced by 91% (0.75 to 0.07 mm). During the compensated post-PVC beat, there were large increases in all outcomes, except for anterograde wall motion. Taken together, there appears to be little influence of either local or upstream factors on anterograde wall motion. Although retrograde wall motion generally mirrored blood pressure, blood velocity, and upstream cardiac movement, the primary motion regulator remains unclear. In this Case Study, we provide evidence against the role of blood velocity in regulating local wall motion and reinforce the potential importance of cardiac mechanics dictating the unique longitudinal motion pattern at the common carotid artery.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Benign arrhythmias can be a useful tool to probe new hypotheses in physiology. We tested the control of longitudinal motion of the common carotid artery wall using observations from spontaneous premature ventricular contractions in a healthy male. Forwards wall motion remained unchanged despite large deviations in local blood velocity and backwards wall motion mirrored changes in pulse pressure, blood velocity, and cardiac motion, thereby revising our original hypothesis of the control of longitudinal wall motion.",Stevens KA; Au JS,arrhythmia; arterial wall; blood flow; left ventricular strain,2021,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",MFE-152454/CIHR/Canada,
rotating_wall,389756,Platelet interactions with the endothelium and the subendothelium: the role of thrombin and prostacyclin.,"The adherence of 51Cr-labeled platelets to rabbit aortae everted on probes rotated in platelet-red cell suspensions has been measured. Platelet adherence to the subendothelium exposed by passage of a balloon catheter before everting the aortae was inhibited by compounds that increase platelet cyclic AMP levels (PGE1, PGI2 or dipyridamole). These agents, however, did not abolish platelet adherence to the subendothelium. Aspirin treatment of the vessel wall was used to block PGI2 production; platelet adherence to the surface of the 'undamaged' aorta and the subendothelium was studied following this treatment. Since aspirin treatment of the 'undamaged' vessel wall did not cause platelets to adhere to it, it seems unlikely that PGI2 formation by the vessel wall is the mechanism that prevents platelet adherence to normal endothelium. In addition, PGI2 formation by the vessel wall does not appear to influence platelet adherence to the subendothelium, since adherence was not increased by aspirin treatment of the damaged wall. Thrombin treatment of the 'undamaged' vessel wall increased platelet adherence to the surface, but the adherent platelets were seen to be adherent only to small areas where the endothelium was lost or damaged. Heparin reversed the effect of thrombin. Similar results were found when the subendothelium was exposed to thrombin or thrombin and heparin.",Cazenave JP; Dejana E; Kinlough-Rathbone R; Packham MA; Mustard JF,,1979,Haemostasis,Journal Article,,

Lymphoblastoid cells cultured in rotating-wall vessels exhibited significant differences in the expression of both early and late Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) antigens. Viral protein expression (as measured by indirect immunofluorescence) was significantly suppressed in cells cultured in simulated microgravity. A significantly greater percentage of P3HR-1 cells and Daudi cells were positive for the expression of BamH1-Z-DNA fragment of Epstein-Barr replication activator (ZEBRA), early antigen restricted (EA-R), and viral capsid antigen (VCA) in cells cultured in static tissue culture flasks as compared to cells cultured in rotating-wall vessels. We observed a 7, 11, and 25-fold reduction, respectively, for EA-R, VCA, and ZEBRA protein in P3HR-1 cells cultured in simulated microgravity. Additionally, suspension cultures of P3HR-1 cells exhibited significantly greater ZEBRA antigen expression than cells cultured in rotating-wall vessels. As an independent confirmation of the reduction in ZEBRA-protein production in simulated microgravity in P3HR-1 cells, ZEBRA-mRNA was quantitated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We observed between a 4 to 10-fold reduction in ZEBRA-mRNA in cells cultured in simulated microgravity as compared to cells cultured at 1 x g in tissue culture flasks.

rotating_wall,36721227,Clinical application of the anterior pelvic wall locking plate (APWLP) in acetabular fractures involving the quadrilateral surface.,"BACKGROUND: The management of acetabular quadrilateral surface fractures remains challenging for surgeons, and the treatment options for such fractures remain controversial. Quadrilateral surface surgery is a complex procedure involving combined approaches, and the quality of fracture reduction closely depends upon the surgical procedure, as well as the skill and experience of the surgeon. This study aimed to explore the clinical effects of applying an anterior pelvic wall locking plate (APWLP) through the lateral-rectus approach for treating acetabular fractures involving the quadrilateral surface. METHODS: This retrospective analysis was comprised of 35 patients with acetabular fractures involving the quadrilateral surface who were treated with an APWLP in our hospital between June 2016 and December 2020. The patients included 25 males and ten females, with an average age of 52.45 years. All the patients were exposed through the lateral-rectus approach, six patients were exposed with an additional iliac fossa approach, and the fractures were fixed by combining an APWLP with a reconstruction plate. The Matta imaging standard was used to assess the quality of the fracture reduction, and the final follow-up clinical outcome was classified as excellent (18 points), good (15-17), fair (13-14), or poor (< 13) according to the modified Merle d'Aubigné-Postel scoring standard. RESULTS: All patients successfully completed the operation, and there was no blood vessel or nerve injury during any of the operations. The average follow-up period was 26.11 months. The mean time of resuming full-weight-bearing activities was 12.88 weeks. Hip flexion and extension and internal and external rotation ranges of motion significantly increased over time. At the last follow-up, Matta's imaging evaluation showed that 24 cases were anatomically reduced, seven cases were satisfactory, and four cases were unsatisfactory. The satisfaction rate was 88.6% (31/35). According to the modified Merle d'Aubigné-Postel scoring standard, the hip function was excellent, good, fair, and poor in 23, 6, 4, and 2 cases, respectively. The excellent and good rates represented 82.9% of the total cases (29/35). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the APWLP for acetabulum quadrilateral surface fracture achieve good to excellent clinical and radiological outcomes, and an APWLP may be a new treatment option for these fractures involving the quadrilateral surface.",Wang Z; Wang Z; Chen G; Gao M; Zhu R; Yang H,Acetabular fracture; Lateral rectus; Quadrilateral surface,2023,Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,26300459,Modified back wall first artery anastomosis technique in living donor liver transplantation.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Back wall technique is usually used for hepatic artery anastomosis in living donor liver-transplantation. In this technique, two stitches are placed in the two corners of the artery wall initially and the microclamp on the artery is rotated to place the sutures to the back wall first. In some cases, the microclamp cannot be rotated because of insufficient length of the graft or recipient artery. If this occurs, it may be difficult to rotate the artery to perform the back wall artery anastomosis technique. In these cases, the difficulty of performing the anastomosis can cause intimal tears. Thus, we prefer a modified technique for artery anastomosis in such situations. METHODS: In this modified technique, two stitches are placed in the middle of the posterior wall and middle of the anterior wall initially. The artery is twisted 90° to the right side and to the left side respectively, instead of one 180° rotation, to place the back wall stitches. CONCLUSION: In this modified technique, reversing the microclamp is eliminated that can cause intimal damage. Therefore, it may be superior to the conventional method in terms of reducing the difficulty of performing anastomosis and intimal damage to the vessels.",Coban S; Yildiz F,back wall technique; liver transplantation,2015,Asian journal of surgery,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,19797790,Hemodynamics and bleb formation in intracranial aneurysms.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial aneurysms with irregular shapes and blebs or secondary outpouchings have been correlated with increased rupture risk. The purpose of this study was to investigate possible associations between the local hemodynamics and the formation of blebs in cerebral aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computational models of 20 cerebral aneurysms harboring 30 well-defined blebs were constructed from 3D rotational angiographies. Models representing the aneurysm before bleb formation were constructed by virtually removing the blebs from the anatomic models. Computational fluid dynamics simulations of the aneurysm before and after bleb formation were performed under pulsatile flows. Flow and WSS visualizations were used to analyze the local hemodynamics in the region of the aneurysm that developed the bleb. RESULTS: Most blebs (80%) occurred at or adjacent to the aneurysm region with the highest WSS before bleb formation, and near the flow impaction zone. Most blebs (83%) were found in regions of the aneurysm previously subjected to high or moderate WSS and progressed to low WSS states after the blebs were formed. Most blebs (77%) were aligned or adjacent to the inflow jet, whereas 17% were aligned with the outflow jet, and only 6% were not aligned with the flow direction. In addition, 90% of the aneurysms had maximal WSS higher than or similar to the WSS in the parent artery. CONCLUSIONS: Blebs form at or adjacent to regions of high WSS and are aligned with major intra-aneurysmal flow structures. Formation of blebs results in a lower WSS state with formation of a counter current vortex. These findings imply that locally elevated WSS could contribute to the focalized wall damage that formed these structures.",Cebral JR; Sheridan M; Putman CM,,2010,AJNR.

rotating_wall,20608949,Formal genesis of the outflow tracts of the heart revisited: previous works in the light of recent observations.,"The formal genesis of the great arteries continues to be controversial due to the lack of consensus of septation of the developing outflow tract. In order to make it clear how the great arteries are generated, we have re-examined our previous papers which emphasized the formation of the aorta and pulmonary trunk, concept of the aorticopulmonary septum, formation of the leaflets of semilunar valves, morphogenesis of the crista supraventricularis, programmed cell death and rotation of the outflow tract. In the present paper, we compare outcomes gained from the re-examination of our previous papers with prevalent interpretations of the arterial trunk. We obtained conclusions as follows: (i) The elongation of the fourth and sixth aortic arch arteries, which sprout from the wall of the aortic sac at the expense of the distal truncus, contributes to the formation of the aorta and pulmonary trunk; (ii) Smooth muscle cells of the tunica media of the arterial trunks do not arise from the transformation of the myocardial cells of the truncus wall (not 'arterialization'); (iii) Truncus swellings are divided into two parts: distal and proximal. The former contributes to the separation of the orifices of arterial trunks ('aorticopulmonary septum'). The latter contributes to the formation of the leaflets of the semilunar valves of the aorta and pulmonary trunk; (iv) The origin of the myocardial cells of the crista supraventricularis is a wall of the conus originated from secondary/anterior heart fields; and (v) There has been no acceptable proof that rotation and counterclockwise rotation are involved.",Okamoto N; Akimoto N; Hidaka N; Shoji S; Sumida H,,2010,Congenital anomalies,Journal Article; Review,,

rotating_wall,3295464,An alternative technique of microvascular anastomosis.,"The femoral arteries and veins of rats were severed and reanastomosed, using either the conventional interrupted suture technique or an alternative interrupted technique that allows the lumen to remain visible throughout the reanastomosis procedure. The alternative technique involves placing the sutures in the posterior wall of the vessel, eliminating the necessity of rotating the microsurgical clamp during the anastomosis. Clinically, this method may be advantageous in cases where the anastomosis is being performed in a deep wound in which there is no room to turn over the microclamp. Additionally, this technique allows the posterior wall of the vessel to be observed throughout the anastomosis procedure, reducing the possibility of accidental placement of sutures through the posterior wall and resulting nonpatency. There was no significant difference between the two techniques in terms of operating time, patency rate, aneurysm formation, arteriography, and histological findings.",Hou SM; Seaber AV; Urbaniak JR,,1987,Microsurgery,Comparative Study; Journal Article,,

In order to provide a three dimensional aspect not seen in the micromass system, and a tissue homogeneity not possible with explants of limb or limb elements, and to alleviate certain difficulties regarding crew time and stowage, we began culturing embryonic limb cells in Rotating Wall Vessels (RWV). First, these cells were attached to beads, and grown for up to 65 days in a type of RWV known as STLV at the Johnson Space Center. During this time, the cells and beads aggregated and the aggregates continued to increase in size, and differentiated into Alcian blue staining chondrocytes. Because our intent was to use these aggregates for implanting into bony defects in addition to their use in studies of chondrogenic regulation at 1g and microgravity, aggregates of these cells without beads were grown in the commercially available version of the STLV, and their ability to ossify when subcutaneously implanted assessed.",Duke J; Daane E; Arizpe J; Montufar-Solis D,,1996,Advances in space research : the official journal of the Committee on Space,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",RR05970/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States,

METHODS: Twelve patients with sinus prostheses (55 ± 15 years), 6 patients with tube grafts (58 ± 12 years), 12 age-matched, healthy volunteers (55 ± 6 years), and 6 young, healthy volunteers (25 ± 3 years) were examined with time-resolved 3-dimensional magnetic resonance phase contrast imaging (4D Flow MRI). Primary and secondary helical, as well as vortical flow patterns, were evaluated. Aortic arch anatomy as a flow influencing factor was determined. RESULTS: Compared with volunteers, both sinus prostheses and tube grafts developed more than 4 times as many secondary flow patterns in the ascending aorta (sinus prostheses n = 1.6 ± 0.8; tube grafts n = 1.3 ± 0.6; age-matched, healthy volunteers n = 0.3 ± 0.5; young, healthy volunteers n = 0; P ≤ .012) associated with a kinking of the prosthesis itself or at its distal anastomosis. As opposed to round aortic arches in volunteers (n = 16/18), cubic or gothic-shaped arches predominated in patients (n = 16/18, P < .001). In all but 3 volunteers, 2 counter-rotating helices were confirmed in the ascending aorta and were defined as a primary flow pattern. This primary flow pattern did not develop in patients who underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement. CONCLUSIONS: In patients after valve-sparing aortic root replacement, there was an increased number of secondary flow patterns in the ascending aorta. This seems to be related to surgically altered aortic geometry with kinking. Because flow alterations are known to affect wall shear stress, there seems to be an increased risk for vessel wall remodeling. Compared with previous 4D Flow MRI studies, primary flow patterns in the ascending aorta in healthy subjects were confirmed to be more complex. This underlines the importance of thorough examination of 4D Flow MRI data. Elsevier Inc.

The lateral abdominal wall is perfused predominantly from perforators arising from the intercostal vessels. Reconstruction of soft tissue defects involving the abdomen presents a difficult challenge for reconstructive surgeons. Pedicle perforator propeller flaps can be used to reconstruct defects of the abdomen, and here we present a thorough review of the literature as well as a case illustrating the perforasome propeller flap concept. A patient underwent resection for dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans resulting in a large defect of the epigastric soft tissue. A propeller flap was designed based on a perforator arising from the superior deep epigastric vessels and was rotated 90° into the defect allowing primary closure of the donor site. The patient healed uneventfully and was without recurrent disease 37 months following reconstruction. Perforator propeller flaps can be used successfully in reconstruction of abdominal defects and should be incorporated into the armamentarium of reconstructive microsurgeons already facile with perforator dissections.",Scaglioni MF; Giuseppe AD; Chang EI,,2015,Microsurgery,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,,

rotating_wall,30056517,Loop microcatheter technique for coil embolization of paraclinoid aneurysms.,"BACKGROUND: Although paraclinoid aneurysms do not exhibit a high risk of rupture, coil embolization is not always easy because of unstable microcatheter position. We present a technique that allows a stable microcatheter position for coil embolization of paraclinoid aneurysms. METHODS: We enrolled 34 consecutive patients who underwent coil embolization for paraclinoid aneurysms. A loop of distal microcatheter was shaped based on three-dimensional rotational angiography. The basic concept is to keep the proximal loop abutting the opposite wall of the aneurysm while using the distal loop for coiling. Then, a proximal curve was made to accommodate the shape of the carotid siphon, which may decide the direction of the loop. Stent-assisted coil embolization was performed in 19 wide-necked aneurysms. Immediate radiological outcomes were analyzed with Raymond classification and clinical outcomes were evaluated with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. RESULTS: Satisfactory occlusion of aneurysm was achieved in 94.1% (32/34) of patients with a Raymond score of 1 or 2. Packing density of ≥ 31% was achieved in 71% (24/34) of patients. No significant differences were observed between stent-assisted coiling and coiling-only groups. Follow-up magnetic resonance angiography and/or angiogram showed stable coil position, except in one patient with tiny recurrence (from Raymond scores 1 to 2) that did not require retreatment at the 6-month follow-up. mRS scores of 0-1 were obtained in all patients at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Loop microcatheter technique allowed safe and stable coil packing for paraclinoid aneurysms. The same procedural concept is also being used for aneurysms in other vascular territories.",Jia ZY; Song YS; Sheen JJ; Kim JG; Lee CW; Suh DC,Aneurysm; Coiling; Embolization; Microcatheter shaping,2018,Acta neurochirurgica,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2018R1A2B6003143/National Research Foundation of Korea/International,

We have developed an in vitro model matching the tortuous curve of the carotid siphon that allows the assessment of apposition of stents to a curved vessel wall. METHODS: Six types of balloon-expandable coronary stents were implanted in a silicone model of the carotid siphon. Digital radiographs and 3D rotational angiograms were obtained. Stent morphology was evaluated and the degree of apposition between stent and wall of the model was measured on a digital workstation. RESULTS: All 6 stents showed lack of apposition between stent and the wall at the convexity of the anterior segment of the carotid siphon and the wall at the concavity at both extremities of the stent. In and around the curve, the modules of the stents did not expand completely to their nominal diameter and were distorted to an oval shape. CONCLUSION: The tested coronary balloon-expandable stents did not completely conform to the vessel wall of the model of the carotid siphon and further development is needed to approach the goal of an ""ideal intracranial stent.""",du Mesnil de Rochemont R; Yan B; Zanella FE; Rüfenacht DA; Berkefeld J,,2006,AJNR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples of normal prostate were obtained as a byproduct of transurethral prostatectomy or needle biopsy. Prostatic tissue dissected into small 1 x 1 mm. blocks was cultured in the Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) Bioreactor for various time periods and analyzed using histological, immunochemical, and total cell RNA assays. RESULTS: We report the long term maintenance of benign explanted human prostate tissue grown in simple culture medium, under the simulated microgravity conditions afforded by the RWV bioreactor. Mesenchymal stromal elements including blood vessels and architecturally preserved tubuloglandular acini were maintained for a minimum of 28 days. Cytokeratins, vimentin and TGF-beta2 receptor and ligand were preserved through the entire culture period as revealed by immunocytochemistry. Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) was continuously expressed during the culture period, although somewhat decreased. Prostatic specific antigen (PSA) and its transcript were down regulated over time of culture. Prostatic carcinoma cells from the TSU cell line were able to invade RWV-cultured benign prostate tissue explants.

Available grafts or surgeries have provided limited durability so far. Generating venous valve substitutes by means of tissue engineering could be a solution. We generated decellularized jugular ovine vein conduits containing valves (oVVC) after reseeding with ovine endothelial cells differentiated from peripheral blood-derived endothelial cells (oPBEC), cultivated in vitro corresponding to the circulatory situation in the lower leg at rest and under exertion. oVVC were decellularized by detergent treatment. GFP-labeled oPBEC were seeded onto the luminal side of the decellularized oVVC and cultivated under static-rotational conditions for 6 h (group I) and 12 h (group II), respectively. Reseeded matrices of group I were exposed to continuous low flow conditions (""leg at rest""). The tissues of group II were exposed to a gradually increasing flow (""leg under effort""). After 5 days, the grafts of group I revealed a uniform luminal endothelial cell coverage of the examined areas of the venous walls and adjacent venous valve leaflets. In group II, the cell coverage on luminal areas of the venous wall parts was found to be nearly complete. The endothelial cell coverage of adjacent venous valve leaflets was revealed to be less dense and confluent. Endothelial cells cultured on acellular vein tissues of both groups were distinctly orientated uniformly in the flow direction, clearly creating a stable and flow-orientated layer. Thus, an endothelium could successfully be reestablished on the luminal surface of a decellularized venous valve by seeding peripheral blood endothelial cells and culturing under different conditions.",Mogaldea A; Goecke T; Theodoridis K; Haverich A; Cebotari S; Hilfiker A,Chronic venous insufficiency; Ovine peripheral blood-derived endothelial cells; Ovine vein conduits; Vein valves,2017,"Cells, tissues, organs","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,10051691,Select de novo gene and protein expression during renal epithelial cell culture in rotating wall vessels is shear stress dependent.,"The rotating wall vessel has gained popularity as a clinical cell culture tool to produce hormonal implants. It is desirable to understand the mechanisms by which the rotating wall vessel induces genetic changes, if we are to prolong the useful life of implants. During rotating wall vessel culture gravity is balanced by equal and opposite hydrodynamic forces including shear stress. The current study provides the first evidence that shear stress response elements, which modulate gene expression in endothelial cells, are also active in epithelial cells. Rotating wall culture of renal cells changes expression of select gene products including the giant glycoprotein scavenger receptors cubulin and megalin, the structural microvillar protein villin, and classic shear stress response genes ICAM, VCAM and MnSOD. Using a putative endothelial cell shear stress response element binding site as a decoy, we demonstrate the role of this sequence in the regulation of selected genes in epithelial cells. However, many of the changes observed in the rotating wall vessel are independent of this response element. It remains to define other genetic response elements modulated during rotating wall vessel culture, including the role of hemodynamics characterized by 3-dimensionality, low shear and turbulence, and cospatial relation of dissimilar cell types.",Kaysen JH; Campbell WC; Majewski RR; Goda FO; Navar GL; Lewis FC; Goodwin TJ; Hammond TG,,1999,The Journal of membrane biology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",DK46117/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States; R21 RR12645/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States,

rotating_wall,32474625,Vascular Anatomy of Mesopancreas in Pancreatoduodenectomy Using an Intestinal Derotation Procedure.,"BACKGROUND: Mesopancreas excision in pancreatoduodenectomy is technically complicated because of the anatomical complexity of the mesopancreas with the inferior peripancreatic blood vessels which is caused by intestinal rotation in fetal life. We have developed a novel artery-first approach (the intestinal derotation procedure) for facilitating mesopancreas excision. The aim of this study was to clarify the vascular anatomy of the mesopancreas after derotation. METHODS: The right-sided colon and small intestine are mobilized from the retroperitoneum, and the intestinal loop is then derotated. In 136 cases of pancreatoduodenectomy employing the derotation procedure, we analyzed the vascular anatomy of the mesopancreas. RESULTS: After derotation, the anatomy was simplified. The mesopancreas extended from the right aspect of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), forming a horizontal plane. The first jejunal trunk (FJT) was situated in parallel with the second jejunal artery and was anterior (91%) or posterior (9%) to the SMA. The inferior pancreaticoduodenal vein (IPDV) entered the right side of the FJT (83%) or the superior mesenteric vein (17%). Besides the IPDV, 1-4 tributaries entered the right wall of the FJT, in 89% of cases. The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery was observed to originate from the right wall of the SMA, sharing a common stem with the first jejunal artery (70%) or branching directly from the SMA (29%). CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal derotation simplifies the mesopancreas anatomy and reveals the anatomical details of the inferior peripancreatic blood vessels in pancreatoduodenectomy.",Sugiyama M; Suzuki Y; Nakazato T; Yokoyama M; Kogure M; Matsuki R; Abe N,,2020,World journal of surgery,Journal Article,,

METHODS: Thirty-three patients with de-novo lesions located in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) who underwent IVUS before and immediately after RA were enrolled. The spatial axes of the two matched pre- and post-RA IVUS cross-sectional images were merged. The segment was considered to have medial damage when the continuity of the intimal layer was disrupted and the medial layer was in direct contact with the lumen on post-RA IVUS. RESULTS: Medial injuries on post-RA IVUS were identified in seven segments of five patients. All segments with medial injury were located near the bifurcation of the LAD and the diagonal branch, and the spatial orientations of the medial injury region were mostly distributed in the lateral side with a diagonal branch take-off. The lumen area was significantly smaller in segments with medial injury than in those without medial injury (P < 0.01). The IVUS catheter was in contact with the healthy side of the arterial wall on pre-RA IVUS images for more than 1 mm in length in all segments with medial injury. CONCLUSION: When the guidewire and IVUS catheter are close to the healthy side of the arterial wall on pre-RA IVUS images, there is a higher risk of medial injury due to the RA procedure, especially near the bifurcation of the LAD and diagonal branch.",Hashimoto K; Fujii K; Shibutani H; Tsujimoto S; Otagaki M; Morishita S; Hirose T; Shiojima I,,2022,Coronary artery disease,Journal Article,,

Over the last 10 to 15 years, short focal stenoses or occlusions have been treated using endovascular techniques, but conventional angioplasty and stenting is limited by high restenosis rates especially in longer lesions. Moreover, multilevel, complex disease is still generally considered best managed by surgical intervention. However, with the improvements in atherectomy technology, namely plaque excision and laser plaque ablation, the full spectrum of arterial occlusive lesions may now be addressed by percutaneous means with excellent limb salvage rates. Excisional atherectomy is currently exemplified by the SilverHawk Plaque Excision System, which is available in four sizes for the treatment of all infrainguinal vessels. As the apparatus is advanced, the rotational cutting blade excises a ribbon of plaque that is concurrently collected into a nosecone. Multiple passes are made, during which the blade is directed sequentially toward all quadrants of the vessel lumen. The stenotic lesion is grossly debulked by this technique with the proposed advantage of avoiding the arterial wall barotrauma that hampers the durability of angioplasty and stenting.",Lin S; McKinsey JF,,2005,Techniques in vascular and interventional radiology,Journal Article; Review,,

This study investigated the potential of beam-steered ARFI and wave-tracking to extend group velocity estimation over a larger proportion of the circumference compared to conventional 0° ARFI-induced wave-tracking. METHODS: Seven vessel-mimicking polyvinyl alcohol cryogel phantoms with various dimensions and compositions and an ex vivo human carotid artery were imaged in a dedicated setup. For every 20⁰ phantom rotation, transverse group wave velocity measurements were performed with an Aixplorer Ultimate system and SL18-5 transducer using 0⁰/20⁰/-20⁰-angled ultrasound pushes. Transmural angular wave velocities were derived along 60⁰-trajectories. A 360⁰-angular velocity map was composed from the top-wall 60⁰-trajectories 0°-data, averaged over all physical phantom rotations (reference). For each phantom rotation, 360⁰-angular velocity maps were composed using 0°-data (0⁰-approach) or data from all angles (beam-steered approach). Percentages of rotations with visible waves and relative angular velocity errors compared to the reference map as function of the circumferential angle were determined for both approaches. RESULTS: Reference 360°-angular velocity maps could be derived for all samples, representing their stiffness. Beam-steering decreased the proportion of the circumference where waves were untraceable by 20% in phantoms and 10% ex vivo, mainly at 0° push locations. Relative errors were similar for both approaches (phantoms: 10-15%, ex vivo: 15-35%). CONCLUSION: Beam-steering enables wave-tracking along a higher proportion of the wall circumference than 0⁰ ARFI-induced wave-tracking.

rotating_wall,21297030,Wall stress of the cervical carotid artery in patients with carotid dissection: a case-control study.,"Spontaneous internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection (sICAD) results from an intimal tear located around the distal carotid sinus. The mechanisms causing the tear are unknown. This case-control study tested the hypotheses that head movements increase the wall stress in the cervical ICA and that the stress increase is greater in patients with sICAD than in controls. Five patients with unilateral, recanalized, left sICAD and five matched controls were investigated before and after maximal head rotation to the left and neck hyperextension after 45° head rotation to the left. The anatomy of the extracranial carotid arteries was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and used to create finite element models of the right ICA. Wall stress increased after head movements. Increases above the 80th and 90th percentile were located at the intimal side of the artery wall from 7.4 mm below to 10 mm above the cranial edge of the carotid sinus, i.e., at the same location as histologically confirmed tears in patients with sICAD. Wall stress increase did not differ between patients and controls. The present findings suggest that wall stress increases at the intimal side of the artery wall surrounding the distal edge of the carotid bulb after head movements may be important for the development of carotid dissection. The lack of wall stress difference between the two groups indicates that the carotid arteries of patients with carotid dissection have either distinct functional or anatomical properties or endured unusually heavy wall stresses to initiate dissection.",Callaghan FM; Luechinger R; Kurtcuoglu V; Sarikaya H; Poulikakos D; Baumgartner RW,,2011,American journal of physiology.

rotating_wall,28489536,Dual-Frequency Piezoelectric Endoscopic Transducer for Imaging Vascular Invasion in Pancreatic Cancer.,"Cancers of the pancreas have the poorest prognosis among all cancers, as many tumors are not detected until surgery is no longer a viable option. Surgical viability is typically determined via endoscopic ultrasound imaging. However, many patients who may be eligible for resection are not offered surgery due to diagnostic challenges in determining vascular or lymphatic invasion. In this paper, we describe the development of a dual-frequency piezoelectric transducer for rotational endoscopic imaging designed to transmit at 4 MHz and receive at 20 MHz in order to image microbubble-specific superharmonic signals. Imaging performance is assessed in a tissue-mimicking phantom at depths from 1 cm [contrast-to-tissue ratio (CTR) = 21.6 dB] to 2.5 cm (CTR = 11.4 dB), in ex vivo porcine vessels, and in vivo in a rodent. The prototyped 1.1-mm aperture transducer demonstrates contrast-specific imaging of microbubbles in a 200- [Formula: see text]-diameter tube through the wall of a 1-cm-diameter porcine artery, suggesting such a device may enable direct visualization of small vessels from within the lumen of larger vessels such as the portal vein or superior mesenteric vein.",Lindsey BD; Kim J; Dayton PA; Jiang X,,2017,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",F32 EB018715/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States; R01 EB015508/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,32048786,Impact of pulmonary vein isolation on mechanisms sustaining persistent atrial fibrillation: Predicting the acute response.,"BACKGROUND: Noninvasive mapping identifies potential drivers (PDs) in atrial fibrillation (AF). We analyzed the impact of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) on PDs and whether baseline PD pattern predicted termination of AF. METHODS: Patients with persistent AF less than 2 years underwent electrocardiographic imaging mapping before and after cryoballoon PVI. We recorded the number of PD occurrences, characteristics (rotational wavefronts ≥ 1.5 revolutions or focal activations), and distribution using an 18-segment atrial model. RESULTS: Of 100 patients recruited, PVI terminated AF in 15 patients; 21.3% ± 9.1% (8.7 ± 4.8) of PDs occurred at the pulmonary veins (PVs) and posterior wall. PVI had no impact on PD occurrences outside the PVs and posterior wall (33.2 ± 12.9 vs 31.6 ± 12.5; P = .164), distribution over the remaining 13 segments (9 [8-11] vs 9 [8-10]; P = .634), the proportion of PDs that was rotational (82.9% ± 9.7% vs 83.6% ± 10.1%; P = .496), or temporal stability (2.4 ± 0.4 vs 2.4 ± 0.5 rotations; P = .541). Fewer focal PDs (area under the curve, 0.683; 95% CI, 0.528-0.839; P = .024) but not rotational PDs (P = .626) predicted AF termination with PVI. CONCLUSIONS: PVI did not have a global impact on PDs outside the PVs and posterior wall. Although fewer focal PDs predicted termination of AF with PVI, the burden of rotational PDs did not. It is accepted though not all PDs are necessarily real or important. Outcome data are needed to confirm whether noninvasive mapping can predict patients likely to respond to PVI.",Dhillon GS; Schilling RJ; Honarbakhsh S; Graham A; Abbass H; Waddingham P; Sawhney V; Creta A; Sporton S; Finlay M; Providencia R; Chow A; Earley MJ; Lowe M; Lambiase PD; Hunter RJ,drivers; mechanisms of atrial fibrillation; noninvasive mapping; persistent atrial fibrillation; pulmonary vein isolation,2020,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,26663707,Hypoxia Created Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Sheet for Prevascularized 3D Tissue Construction.,"3D tissue based on human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) sheets offers many interesting opportunities for regenerating multiple types of connective tissues. Prevascularizing hMSC sheets with endothelial cells (ECs) will improve 3D tissue performance by supporting cell survival and accelerating integration with host tissue. It is hypothesized that hypoxia cultured hMSC sheets can promote microvessel network formation and preserve stemness of hMSCs. This study investigates the vascularization of hMSC sheets under different oxygen tensions. It is found that the HN condition, in which hMSC sheets formed under physiological hypoxia (2% O2 ) and then cocultured with ECs under normoxia (20% O2 ), enables longer and more branched microvessel network formation. The observation is corroborated by higher levels of angiogenic factors in coculture medium. Additionally, the hypoxic hMSC sheet is more uniform and less defective, which facilitates fabrication of 3D prevascularized tissue construct by layering the prevascularized hMSC sheets and maturing in rotating wall vessel bioreactor. The hMSCs in the 3D construct still maintain multilineage differentiation ability, which indicates the possible application of the 3D construct for various connective tissues regeneration. These results demonstrate that hypoxia created hMSC sheets benefit the microvessel growth and it is feasible to construct 3D prevascularized tissue construct using the prevascularized hMSC sheets.",Zhang L; Xing Q; Qian Z; Tahtinen M; Zhang Z; Shearier E; Qi S; Zhao F,cell sheets; human mesenchymal stem cells; hypoxia; rotating wall vessel bioreactors; vascularization,2016,Advanced healthcare materials,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",1R15HL115521-01A1/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,23903054,New coronary retroinfusion technique in the Rat infarct model: transjugular cardiac vein catheterization.,"Cell delivery via the retrograde coronary route boasts less vessel embolism, myocardial injury, and arrhythmogenicity when compared with those via antegrade coronary administration or myocardial injection. However, conventional insertion into the coronary sinus and consequent bleeding complication prevent its application in small animals. To overcome the complication of bleeding, we described a modified coronary retroinfusion technique via the jugular vein route in rats with myocardial infarction (MI). A flexible wire with a bent end was inserted into the left internal jugular vein and advanced slowly along the left superior vena cava. Under direct vision, the wire was run into the left cardiac vein by rotating the wire and changing the position of its tip. A fine tube was then advanced along the wire to the left cardiac vein. This modified technique showed less lethal hemorrhage than the conventional technique. Retroinfusion via transjugular catheter enabled efficient fluid or cell dissemination to the majority areas of the free wall of the left ventricle, covering the infarcted anterior wall. In conclusion, transjugular cardiac vein catheterization may make retrocoronary infusion a more safe and practical route for delivering cell, drug, and gene therapy into the infarcted myocardium of rats.",Huang Z; Shen Y; Zhu H; Xu J; Song Y; Hu X; Shuning Z; Yang X; Sun A; Qian J; Ge J,,2013,Experimental animals,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,19121988,The anatomic basis of the internal mammary artery perforator flap: a cadaver study.,"INTRODUCTION: The perforating branches of the internal mammary artery have recently been described as recipient vessel for free-tissue transfer breast reconstruction. However, reports on perforator flaps based on these vessels are rare. The aim of this study was to investigate the vascular basis of the internal mammary artery perforator (IMAP) flap and to describe the location and size of the individual flaps. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The IMAPs of 10 fresh female cadavers were injected with methylene blue solution. The location and size of the labelled skin area were observed. Finally, the arterial perforators were dissected, and the length, diameter and the distance of the lateral sternal border to the perforation point were recorded. RESULTS: The IMAPs supplied the skin of the ventromedial thorax and breast from the clavicle to the skin of the cranial abdominal wall in a sequential order. The mean size of all injected skin areas was 84+/-54 cm(2) (13 x 7 cm). The biggest detected skin dimensions were 16 x 9 cm on average for IMAP 2 (area 138+/-41 cm(2)). The mean external diameter of the IMAP was 1.3+/-0.5 mm (range: 0.4-2.9 mm). The mean dissectible length was 8.3+/-3.6 cm (range: 3-17 cm). The largest diameter was found for IMAP 2 with a mean of 1.6+/-0.5 mm (range: 0.9-2.3 mm). CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, a reliable anatomy of the IMAP flap could be demonstrated. Based on these results, different clinical applications exist for the individual IMAP flaps. The flaps based on IMAP 1 or 2 may be rotated cranially for tracheostoma or anterior neck reconstruction. The flaps based on IMAP 4 supplying the skin of the inframammary fold could be used for reconstruction of the contralateral thoracic wall or breast. The harvest site of IMAP 1 and 2 can be closed directly if the width of the flap is less than 6 cm. The IMAP 4 harvest site could be closed via a reduction mammaplasty technique, thus minimising donor-site morbidity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

rotating_wall,32086206,An Angle-Independent Cross-Sectional Doppler Method for Flow Estimation in the Common Carotid Artery.,"The Doppler ultrasound is the most common technique for noninvasive quantification of blood flow, which, in turn, is of major clinical importance for the assessment of the cardiovascular condition. In this article, a method is proposed in which the vessel is imaged in the short axis, which has the advantage of capturing the whole flow profile while measuring the vessel area simultaneously. This view is easier to obtain than the longitudinal image that is currently used in flow velocity estimation, reducing operator dependence. However, the Doppler angle in cross-sectional images is unknown since the vessel wall can no longer be used to estimate the flow direction. The proposed method to estimate the Doppler angle in these images is based on the elliptical intersection between a cylindrical vessel and the ultrasound plane. The parameters of this ellipse (major axis, minor axis, and rotation) are used to estimate the Doppler angle by solving a least-squares problem. Theoretical feasibility was shown in a geometrical model, after which the Doppler angle was estimated in simulated ultrasound images generated in Field II, yielding a mean error within 4°. In vitro, across 15 short-axis measurements with a wide variety of Doppler angles, errors in the flow estimates were below 10%, and in vivo, the average velocities in systole obtained from longitudinal ( v=69.1 cm/s) and cross-sectional ( v=66.5 cm/s) acquisitions were in agreement. Further research is required to validate these results on a larger population.",van Knippenberg L; van Sloun RJG; Shulepov S; Bouwman RA; Mischi M,,2020,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Eight fresh human carotid endarterectomy samples were successfully pressurized and tested. About 36 2-D (+t) ultrasound datasets were acquired by rotating the vessel in 10° steps (Echo-CT), from which both 3-D geometry and 3-D strain data were obtained. Both geometry and morphology were assessed with micro-CT imaging, identifying calcified and lipid rich regions. US-based and CT-based geometries were matched for comparison and were found to show good agreement, with an average similarity index of 0.71. Realistic pressure-volume relations were found for 6 out of 9 samples. 3-D strain datasets were reconstructed, revealing realistic strain patterns and magnitudes, although the data did suffer from a relatively high variability. The percentage of fat and calcifications (micro-CT) were compared with the median, 75th and 99th percentile strain values (Echo-CT). A moderate trend was observed for 75th and 99th percentile strains, higher strains were found for more lipid rich plaques, where lower strains were found for highly calcified plaques. However, an inverse numerical modeling technique is necessary for proper mechanical characterization the of plaque components, using the geometry, morphology and wall deformation as input.",Boekhoven RW; Rutten MC; van Sambeek MR; van de Vosse FN; Lopata RG,Atherosclerosis; Inflation; Plaque; Ultrasound,2014,Journal of biomechanics,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

We studied a new technique of USGIJV cannulation to minimize or avoid PVWP, thereby decreasing overall complication rate, irrespective of the operators' experience level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After ethical approval, a prospective study was conducted on adult patients of either gender between 18-65 years of age, belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status I-III, undergoing general anesthesia and requiring USG-guided IJV cannulation. After induction of general anesthesia and intubation, USG-guided IJV cannulation was done using technique of ""proximal pen-holding method"" in patients placed in supine position with neck rotated in 15° rotation to the opposite side. The primary outcome was defined as success rate of USG-guided IJV cannulation and incidence of PVWP. The secondary outcome was the incidences of complications such as arterial puncture, adjacent tissue damage, and performer's ease of the procedure (0-10 scale; 0 denoting no ease and extreme difficulty and 10 denoting extreme ease and no difficulty). RESULTS: In 135 patients, right IJV puncture, guidewire, and central line insertion were achieved in single attempt without any PVWP by nine operators which included two anesthesia consultants and seven senior registrars. No complications were reported and ease of procedure were rated as median (interquartile range) of 10 (10). CONCLUSIONS: The ""proximal pen-holding method"" for real-time USG-IJV cannulation helped in avoiding PVWP with lesser complication rate and greater performer's ease.",Gupta D; Misra G; Haldar R; Srivastava S; Agarwal A,Central venous catheters; internal carotid artery; internal jugular vein,2019,Annals of cardiac anaesthesia,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,30139642,Aortic flow after valve sparing root replacement with or without neosinuses reconstruction.,"OBJECTIVES: This study applied advanced 4-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging processing to assess differences in aortic flow dynamics after valve sparing root replacement, with and without reconstruction of the Valsalva sinuses. METHODS: We enrolled patients after valve sparing root replacement with a straight tubular prosthesis (n = 10) or with a prosthesis with Valsalva neosinuses (n = 10); age-matched subjects without cardiovascular diseases served as controls (n = 10). 4-Dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging acquisitions were performed on a 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging unit. In-house processing was used to segment the aortic lumen and extract the volumetric 4-dimensional flow velocity field. Velocity flow streamlines were computed to compare the amount of rotational flow and wall shear stress. Occurrence of abnormal wall shear stress (WSS) was estimated within the descending aorta of each surgical group. RESULTS: Physiologic-like sinus vortices were visible in the aortic root when using the prosthesis with neosinuses, whereas straight tubular graft revealed localized intrados malrotations (P = .003 for organized vortical structures vs neosinuses graft and P < .001 vs control). In the ascending aorta, recreation of the sinuses resulted in significantly lower velocity and WSS than in the straight tubular graft (P < .001) and controls (P < .001), these alterations were attenuated in the mid-descending aorta. Incidence of abnormal WSS was markedly higher in the straight tube grafts than neosinus of Valsalva grafts. CONCLUSIONS: Re-creation of the sinuses of Valsalva during valve-sparing root replacement is associated with more physiologic flow and significantly lower WSS in the aortic root. Lower WSSs in the distal thoracic aorta is a novel finding with potential implications on distal aortic remodeling. Elsevier Inc.

rotating_wall,27467730,Haemodynamic assessment of human coronary arteries is affected by degree of freedom of artery movement.,"Abnormal haemodynamic parameters are associated with atheroma plaque progression and instability in coronary arteries. Flow recirculation, shear stress and pressure gradient are understood to be important pathogenic mediators in coronary disease. The effect of freedom of coronary artery movement on these parameters is still unknown. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations were carried out in 25 coronary artery models derived from authentic human coronaries in order to investigate the effect of degree of freedom of movement of the coronary arteries on flow recirculation, wall shear stress (WSS) and wall pressure gradient (WPG). Each FSI model had distinctive supports placed upon it. The quantitative and qualitative differences in flow recirculation, maximum wall shear stress (MWSS), areas of low wall shear stress (ALWSS) and maximum wall pressure gradient (MWPG) for each model were determined. The results showed that greater freedom of movement was associated with lower MWSS, smaller ALWSS, smaller flow recirculation zones and lower MWPG. With increasing percentage diameter stenosis (%DS), the effect of degree of freedom on flow recirculation and WSS diminished. Freedom of movement is an important variable to be considered for computational modelling of human coronary arteries, especially in the setting of mild to moderate stenosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A vessel replica was fabricated with polydimethylsiloxanes using 3D printing technology from vascular image data acquired by rotational angiography. The vascular model was coated with fibronectin and immersed in a tube filled with a cell suspension of endothelium, and then cultured while being slowly rotated in three dimensions. Culture medium with viscosity was perfused in the circulation with the endothelialized vascular model. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study was conducted using perfusion conditions used in the flow experiment. The morphology of endothelial cells was observed under a confocal microscope. RESULTS: The CFD study showed low wall shear stress and circulating flow in the apex of the basilar tip aneurysm, with linear flow in the parent artery. Confocal imaging demonstrated that the inner surface of the vascular model was evenly covered with monolayer endothelial cells. After 24 h of flow circulation, endothelial cells in the parent artery exhibited a spindle shape and aligned with the flow direction. In contrast, endothelial cells in the aneurysmal apex were irregular in shape and size. CONCLUSIONS: A geometrically realistic intracranial aneurysm model with live endothelial lining was successfully developed. This in vitro model enables a new research approach combining study of the biological impact of complex flow on endothelial cells with CFD analysis and patient information, including the presence of aneurysmal growth or rupture. the article) 2018.

Advantages of assessment with three-dimensional rotational angiography.,"PURPOSE: Whether an infundibular dilation (ID) is an anatomical variant or a pre-aneurysm has not been clearly determined. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anatomical change of IDs by use of three-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA) with volume rendering (VR). METHODS: One-hundred thirty-eight patients with known or suspected aneurysms, treated consecutively, underwent both two-dimensional digital subtraction angiography (2DDSA) and 3DRA with VR. Two readers evaluated the IDs or aneurysms blindly, using 2DDSA and 3DRA, according to the same diagnostic criteria. A 5-point scale of observer confidence was used to determine the presence of IDs or aneurysms. For 3DRA with VR, the relationship between IDs and aneurysms was classified as one of the three types: type I, protrusion or bulge from side wall of IDs; type II, aneurysms involving or enclosing IDs; or type III, aneurysms and IDs coexisting near each other but with some distance between them. RESULTS: The number of IDs found by 2DDSA and 3DRA with VR was 41 and 48, respectively. Five anterior choroidal arteries and two posterior communicating arteries IDs were missed by 2DDSA. According to 3DRA with VR, there were five IDs of type I, nine of type II, and 22 of type III. CONCLUSIONS: The 3DRA with VR appears superior to 2DRA for both diagnosing IDs and displaying the anatomical relationship between IDs and aneurysms. The findings also suggest that some IDs might progress to aneurysms or become a part of them, which should be carefully evaluated prior to operation.",Shi WY; Li YD; Li MH; Gu BX; Wang W; Zhang BL; Li M,,2011,Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,10386732,Modeling geometric artefacts in intravascular ultrasound imaging.,"A model has been developed for estimating the geometric distortions in intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging caused by the position of the ultrasound catheter within the artery. Geometric distortion causes degradation on cross-sectional images of the vessel wall where, for characteristic positioning of the transducer within the vessel, a circular artery is seen on IVUS images as a noncircular vessel represented by more or less complex shapes. Artefacts, therefore, have a clinical impact on the accuracy of qualitative and quantitative intravascular analyses. The main distortions are due to the inclination and the off-centered position of the transducer within the vessel. These effects are increased by two factors: first, the point of origin of the ultrasound beam does not coincide with the rotation axis of the catheter; second, in the case of a mechanical rotating transducer, the ultrasound beam is not perpendicular to the long axis of the catheter, but has an inclination such that the transducer looks forward from the emitting point. All these parameters are taken into account in the three-dimensional (3-D) geometric model developed in this paper. The model was formulated to predict the geometric deformation for artery contour of various shapes and can model artefacts during stent implantation (Finet et al. 1998). Simulations were made for various geometric configurations and compared to in vitro and in vivo IVUS images. The model results are consistent with the experimental results. Finally, the model was used for estimating the values of the geometric parameters that cause distortions on ultrasonic images.",Delachartre P; Cachard C; Finet G; Gerfault FL; Vray D,,1999,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Their function is modulated by chemical ligands as well as mechanical factors. The mechanical stresses acting on the vessel wall include the normal and circumferential stresses that result from the action of blood pressure, the shear stress that acts parallel to the luminal surface of the vessel due to blood flow and the magnitude and orientation of the gravitation field. The aim of this work was to design and construct a novel bioreactor for the stimulation of endothelial cells in vitro with a combination of mechanical factors that simulates their in vivo environment.",Dermenoudis S; Missirlis Y,,2010,Journal of biomechanics,Journal Article,,

We present the case of a 40-year-old woman cyclist who was struck by a car while wearing a helmet, and was neurologically near normal immediately thereafter at Emergency. She presented 48 h later with acute right hemiparesis, decreasing level of consciousness, and unsteadiness. CT revealed massive cerebellar infarction. CT angiography was normal. The patient died in coma 7 days after injury and autopsy revealed bilateral edematous cerebellar infarction and bilateral vertebral artery dissection. Rotational neck injury and mural tear in the wall of the Atlantic parts of both vertebral arteries is suggested as the possible mechanism of the arterial injury. Head and neck injuries are reported as a precipitating cause of vertebral artery injury. The possible influence of trauma may be further underestimated if longer intervals between vessel dissection and ischemia occur. The current case illustrates that ""talk-and-die"" syndrome may be due to occult vertebral artery dissection, possibly bilateral. In forensic cases of delayed death after mild trauma to the head and neck, the vertebral arteries should be examined for the cause of death.",Galtés I; Borondo JC; Cos M; Subirana M; Martin-Fumadó C; Castellà J; Medallo J,,2012,Forensic science international,Case Reports; Journal Article,,

Chondrocytes were freshly isolated from bovine cartilage and placed into the RWV with Cytodex-3 microcarriers. Nonadherent petri dishes were initiated with microcarriers as representative of standard culture conditions. In the RWV, large three-dimensional aggregates (5-7 mm) were formed in suspension. In addition, a large sheet of matrix adhered to the oxygenator core and vessel endcaps. Petri dish culture resulted in the formation of sheets of chondrocytes with no matrix production. Immunocytochemical analyses on histologic sections of tissue obtained from the RWV and the petri dish controls were performed with antibodies against fibronectin, collagen II, chondroitin-4-sulfate, chondroitin-6-sulfate, and vimentin. Results demonstrated increased signal in the RWV material while the petri dishes demonstrated a slight decrease in signal. In addition, differentiated chondrocytes were observed in sections of RWV material through 36 d, while few were observed in the sections of petri dish material. These results indicate that the unique conditions provided by the RWV afford access to cellular processes that signify the initiation of differentiation as well as production of normal matrix material.",Baker TL; Goodwin TJ,,1997,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

The blood flow velocities (BFV), the internal diameters (D) and the vessel wall intima-media thickness (IMT) in the common carotid arteries (CCA) were recorded with color duplex sonography. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were measured and mean blood pressure (MBP) was calculated by the formula of Wiggers. Whole blood viscosity (WBV) at the shear rate of 94.5 s-1 was measured on the day of the Doppler ultrasound examination with a rotational viscometer Contraves Low Shear 30. Wall shear stress (WSS), the circumferential wall tension (T) and the tensile stress tau were calculated. The main RF in the patients' groups were hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

rotating_wall,16442768,Improved vessel morphology measurements in contrast-enhanced multi-detector computed tomography coronary angiography with non-linear post-processing.,"Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) permits detection of coronary plaque. However, noise and blurring impair accuracy and precision of plaque measurements. The aim of the study was to evaluate MDCT post-processing based on non-linear image deblurring and edge-preserving noise suppression for measurements of plaque size. Contrast-enhanced MDCT coronary angiography was performed in four subjects (mean age 55 +/- 5 years, mean heart rate 54 +/- 5 bpm) using a 16-slice scanner (Siemens Sensation 16, collimation 16 x 0.75 mm, gantry rotation 420 ms, tube voltage 120 kV, tube current 550 mAs, 80 mL of contrast). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS; 40 MHz probe) was performed in one vessel in each patient and served as a reference standard. MDCT vessel cross-sectional images (1 mm thickness) were created perpendicular to centerline and aligned with corresponding IVUS images. MDCT images were processed using a deblurring and edge-preserving noise suppression algorithm. Then, three independent blinded observers segmented lumen and outer vessel boundaries in each modality to obtain vessel cross-sectional area and wall area in the unprocessed MDCT cross-sections, post-processed MDCT cross-sections and corresponding IVUS. The wall area measurement difference for unprocessed and post-processed MDCT images relative to IVUS was 0.4 +/- 3.8 mm2 and -0.2 +/- 2.2 mm2 (p < 0.05), respectively. Similarly, Bland-Altman analysis of vessel cross-sectional area from unprocessed and post-processed MDCT images relative to IVUS showed a measurement difference of 1.0 +/- 4.4 and 0.6 +/- 4.8 mm2, respectively. In conclusion, MDCT permitted accurate in vivo measurement of wall area and vessel cross-sectional area as compared to IVUS. Post-processing to reduce blurring and noise reduced variability of wall area measurements and reduced measurement bias for both wall area and vessel cross-sectional area.",Ferencik M; Lisauskas JB; Cury RC; Hoffmann U; Abbara S; Achenbach S; Karl WC; Brady TJ; Chan RC,,2006,European journal of radiology,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",1 T32 HL076136-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,35348999,Effect of catheter ablation on the hemodynamics of the left atrium : Hemodynamics of ablation.,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the impact of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) on left atrial (LA) flow dynamics and geometrical changes. METHODS: This exploratory study included computational flow simulations from 10 patients who underwent catheter ablation for AF. Complete cardiac cycle dataset was simulated before and after ablation using computational fluid dynamics. The study main endpoints were the changes in LA volume, LA velocity, LA wall shear stress (WSS), circulation (Γ), vorticity, pulmonary vein (PV) ostia area, and LA vortices before and after ablation. RESULTS: There was an average decrease in LA volume (11.58 ± 15.17%) and PV ostia area (16.6 ± 21.41%) after ablation. A non-uniform trend of velocity and WSS changes were observed after ablation. Compared with pre-ablation, 4 patients exhibited lower velocities, WSS distributions, and a decreased Γ (> 8.5%), while 6 developed higher velocities and WSS distributions. These geometrical changes dictated different flow mixing in the LA and distinct vortex patterns, characterized by different spinning velocities, vorticities, and rotational directions. Regions with q-criterion > 0 were found to be dominant in the LA, indicating prevalent rotational vortex structures. CONCLUSION: Catheter ablation for AF induced different geometrical changes on the LA and the PVs, therefore influencing flow mixing and vortex patterns in the LA, in addition to overall velocity and WSS distribution. Further exploration of the impact of catheter ablation on intracardiac flow dynamics is warranted to discern patterns that may correlate with clinical outcomes.

rotating_wall,3685488,Oblique magnetic resonance imaging of the cardiovascular system.,"This exhibit demonstrates that cardiac anatomy can be imaged by MRI in oblique planes that are equivalent to views obtained radiographically or at angiocardiography. These MR images may be obtained either by simple patient positioning or by electronic rotation of the imaging axis. The advantages of this technique include its simplicity and its ability to show detailed anatomy noninvasively. Major cardiac structures including chambers, walls, vessels and bronchi are optimally demonstrated in long axis or cross section. This permits estimation of chamber volume, wall thickness, vessel position and variations from normal. Smaller structures are also well visualized. These include the pericardium, papillary muscles, azygos vein and some cross sectional anatomy of the coronary arteries and veins. The valvular structures can be shown during diastole or systole. The ability of MRI to show these cardiac structures due to the intrinsic contrast differences in signal intensity between muscle, fat, flowing blood and lung suggest an important future for MR cardiac imaging in a broad group of congenital and acquired diseases of the heart, pericardium and great vessels.",Rholl KS; Levitt RG; Glazer HS; Gutierrez FR; Murphy WA; Lee JK; Geltman EM; Peterson RR,,1986,Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,29401262,Novel insights by 4D Flow imaging on aortic flow physiology after valve-sparing root replacement with or without neosinuses.,"OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to evaluate the flow dynamics in the aortic root after valve-sparing root replacement with and without neosinuses of Valsalva reconstruction, by exploiting the capability of 4D Flow imaging to measure in vivo blood velocity fields and 3D geometric flow patterns. METHODS: Ten patients who underwent valve-sparing root replacement utilizing grafts with neosinuses or straight tube grafts (5 cases each) were evaluated by 4D Flow imaging at a mean of 46.5 months after surgery. We used in-house processing tools to quantify relevant bulk flow variables (flow rate, stroke volume, peak velocity and mean velocity), wall shear stresses and the amount of flow rotation characterizing the region enclosed by the graft and the aortic valve leaflets. RESULTS: Despite bulk flows with similar peak velocities, flow rates and stroke volumes (P = 0.31-1.00), the neosinuses graft was associated with a lower mean velocity (P < 0.03) and magnitude of wall shear stress along the axial direction of the vessel wall (P < 0.05) at the proximal root level but remained comparable along the circumferential direction (P = 0.22-1.0) to the straight tube graft. Flow rotation was evidently and systematically higher in the neosinuses grafts, characterized by streamline rotations higher than 270°, nearly triple that of tubular grafts (10.3 ÷ 14.0% of all aortic streamline vs 2.2 ÷ 5.7%, P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Recreation of the sinuses of Valsalva during valve-sparing root replacement is associated with significantly lower wall shear stress and organized vortical flows at the level of the sinus that are not evident using the straight tube graft. These findings need confirmation in larger studies and could have important implications in terms of aortic valve durability.",Galea N; Piatti F; Sturla F; Weinsaft JW; Lau C; Chirichilli I; Carbone I; Votta E; Catalano C; De Paulis R; Girardi LN; Redaelli A; Gaudino M,,2018,Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,34046777,Local hemodynamic analysis after coronary stent implantation based on Euler-Lagrange method.,"Coronary stents are deployed to treat the coronary artery disease (CAD) by reopening stenotic regions in arteries to restore blood flow, but the risk of the in-stent restenosis (ISR) is high after stent implantation. One of the reasons is that stent implantation induces changes in local hemodynamic environment, so it is of vital importance to study the blood flow in stented arteries. Based on regarding the red blood cell (RBC) as a rigid solid particle and regarding the blood (including RBCs and plasma) as particle suspensions, a non-Newtonian particle suspensions model is proposed to simulate the realistic blood flow in this work. It considers the blood's flow pattern and non-Newtonian characteristic, the blood cell-cell interactions, and the additional effects owing to the bi-concave shape and rotation of the RBC. Then, it is compared with other four common hemodynamic models (Newtonian single-phase flow model, Newtonian Eulerian two-phase flow model, non-Newtonian single-phase flow model, non-Newtonian Eulerian two-phase flow model), and the comparison results indicate that the models with the non-Newtonian characteristic are more suitable to describe the realistic blood flow. Afterwards, based on the non-Newtonian particle suspensions model, the local hemodynamic environment in stented arteries is investigated. The result shows that the stent strut protrusion into the flow stream would be likely to produce the flow stagnation zone. And the stent implantation can make the pressure gradient distribution uneven. Besides, the wall shear stress (WSS) of the region adjacent to every stent strut is lower than 0.5 Pa, and along the flow direction, the low-WSS zone near the strut behind is larger than that near the front strut. What's more, in the regions near the struts in the proximal of the stent, the RBC particle stagnation zone is easy to be formed, and the erosion and deposition of RBCs are prone to occur. These hemodynamic analyses illustrate that the risk of ISR is high in the regions adjacent to the struts in the proximal and the distal ends of the stent when compared with struts in other positions of the stent. So the research can provide a suggestion on the stent design, which indicates that the strut structure in these positions of a stent should be optimized further.",Wang Y; Zhan J; Bian W; Tang X; Zeng M,Blood flow; Coronary stent; In-stent restenosis; Non-Newtonian fluid; Red blood cells,2021,Journal of biological physics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,36640542,A vertical additive-lathe printing system for the fabrication of tubular constructs using gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel.,"Reproducing both the mechanical and biological performance of native blood vessels remains an ongoing challenge in vascular tissue engineering. Additive-lathe printing offers an attractive method of fabricating long tubular constructs as a potential vascular graft for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Printing hydrogels onto rotating horizontal mandrels often leads to sagging, resulting in poor and variable mechanical properties. In this study, an additive-lathe printing system with a vertical mandrel to fabricate tubular constructs is presented. Various concentrations of gelatin methacryloyl (gelMA) hydrogel were used to print grafts on the rotating mandrel in a helical pattern. The printing parameters were selected to achieve the bonding of consecutive gelMA filaments to improve the quality of the printed graft. The hydrogel filaments were fused properly under the action of gravity on the vertical mandrel. Thus, the vertical additive-lathe printing system was used to print uniform wall thickness grafts, eliminating the hydrogel sagging problem. Tensile testing performed in both circumferential and longitudinal direction revealed that the anisotropic properties of printed gelMA constructs were similar to those observed in the native blood vessels. In addition, no leakage was detected through the walls of the gelMA grafts during burst pressure measurement. Therefore, the current printing setup could be utilized to print vascular grafts for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",Fazal F; Melchels FPW; McCormack A; Silva AF; Callanan A; Koutsos V; Radacsi N,Additive-lathe; Anisotropic index; Burst pressure; Extrusion-based printing; Gelatin methacryloyl; Tubular constructs,2023,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,37329426,Hemodynamic study of blood flow in the aorta during the interventional robot treatment using fluid-structure interaction.,"An interventional robot is a means for vascular diagnosis and treatment, and it can perform dredging, releasing drug and operating. Normal hemodynamic indicators are a prerequisite for the application of interventional robots. The current hemodynamic research is limited to the absence of interventional devices or interventional devices in fixed positions. Considering the coupling effect of blood, vessels and robots, based on the bi-directional fluid-structure interaction, using the computational fluid dynamics and particle image velocimetry methods, combined with the sliding and moving mesh technologies, we theoretically and experimentally study the hemodynamic indicators such as blood flow lines, blood pressure, equivalent stress, deformation and wall shear stress of blood vessels when the robot precesses, rotates or does not intervene in the pulsating blood flow. The results show that the intervention of the robot increase the blood flow rate, blood pressure, equivalent stress and deformation of the vessels by 76.4%, 55.4%, 76.5%, and 346%, respectively. The operating mode of the robot during low-speed operation has little impact on the hemodynamic indicators. Using the methyl silicone oil as the experimental fluid, the elastic silicone pipe as the experimental pipe, and the intervention robot having a bioplastic outer shell, the velocity of the fluid around the robot is measured on the developed experimental device for fluid flow field in a pulsating flow when the robot runs. The experimental results are similar to the numerical results.

rotating_wall,18849053,Computational modeling of microarterial anastomoses with size discrepancy (small-to-large).,"OBJECTIVE: Among causes of anastomotic failure in microvascular surgery is vessel size mismatch. Where the option of an end-to-side anastomosis is unavailable, an end-to-end construct must be used. Several end-to-end techniques are described to deal with size mismatch. The aim of this study was to numerically model arterial flow patterns and wall shear stresses in four idealized end-to-end anastomoses, where the upstream or recipient artery is smaller. The four techniques modeled were: an invaginating anastomosis; a fish-mouth incision of the smaller vessel; an oblique section of the smaller vessel; and a wedge excision of the larger vessel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Flow rate in the right femoral artery of a single outbred male Wistar rat was recorded by transit time ultrasound. Initially, upstream vessel diameter in the models was set at 1 mm, and downstream at 2 mm. The wedge technique was further modeled using a shorter wedge, and using a downstream vessel diameter of 3 mm. Walls were deemed noncompliant. Flow was modeled by the finite volume method using the commercially available computational fluid dynamics code Fluent (Fluent Inc., Lebanon, NH; http://www.fluent.com). RESULTS: Ring vortices were seen in the invagination and fish-mouth models and showed similar characteristics, although they were less pronounced in the fish-mouth model. The oblique section model demonstrated complex, spiral, counter-rotating vortices that dissipated downstream. Flow separation was least in the first wedge model, with centralization of flow during high but decelerating flow rate. Shortening the wedge length or increasing the downstream vessel diameter to 3 mm led to flow separation. Wall shear stresses were broadly similar for all constructs. CONCLUSION: Of those modeled, excision of a wedge of the larger vessel proved the best construct. Where a vessel diameter ratio is 1:2, wedge length should be twice the diameter of the larger vessel. A vessel ratio of 1:3 leads to flow separation when using the wedge technique.",Rickard RF; Meyer C; Hudson DA,,2009,The Journal of surgical research,Journal Article,,

Appropriate cannulation technique is critical in maintaining the integrity of vascular access. This study focused on analyzing the hemodynamic effect of needle rotation, which is performed to alleviate the pressure if the needle becomes attached to the blood vessel wall. The hemodynamic benefits (normal wall shear stress [WSS] and smooth flow with no oscillatory motion) of this technique are investigated in an idealized model of the cephalic vein in order to determine a needle position that will reduce conditions known to contribute to vascular access failure. A computational fluid dynamics study was conducted, with antegrade and retrograde orientations simulated on the arterial needle, whereas the venous needle is placed in the antegrade orientation. In every case, needle rotation offered no hemodynamic benefit in minimizing the conditions known to cause endothelial damage, a precursor to vascular access failure. Venous needle rotation reduced the maximum WSS by 30%. However, the WSS was above the range, which may damage the endothelial layer. The arterial needle in the antegrade orientation produced a large region of oscillatory shear, whereas a retrograde orientation produced a region of smooth flow in the vicinity of the needle with only a small region of oscillatory shear. The flow through the venous needle back eye was negligible, whereas the arterial needle back eye was more efficient in the retrograde orientation. Therefore, the venous needle should not be rotated, whereas the arterial needle may be rotated to alleviate pressure with consideration given to the orientation of the needle. and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Fulker D; Simmons A; Kabir K; Kark L; Barber T,Arteriovenous fistula; Computational fluid dynamics; Hemodialysis; Needle; Rotation; Vascular access,2016,Artificial organs,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,18798142,A modified technique of end-to-side microvascular anastomosis for the posterior wall.,"A modified technique of interrupted suturing for the posterior wall in end-to-side microvascular anastomosis is presented. It has advantages, especially for the suturing of the pedicle vein and the internal jugular vein in head and neck reconstructions when the pedicle vessel is so short that it cannot be turned over to expose the posterior wall. The pedicle vein is located vertical to the internal jugular vein, and the first stitch begins at the left end of the vessels for a right-handed person. To facilitate the exposure of the left edge of the vessels, the donor vessel is rotated approximately 90 degrees. The advantage of our technique is clear visualization of each suture by rotating the pedicle vessel. Subsequent to the interrupted suturing of the posterior wall, the anterior wall can be sutured by conventional methods. This modified technique is useful for end-to-side microvascular anastomosis, which the microsurgeon may find useful.",Nakagawa M; Inoue K; Iida T; Asano T,,2008,Journal of reconstructive microsurgery,Journal Article,,

DESIGN AND SETTING: Experiments with models were made in a private chiropractic clinic, whereas studies of cadaveric specimens were performed in an anatomy laboratory. Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies were carried out in the radiology department of a public hospital. PATIENTS: Eight patients had their vertebral arteries examined by use of a Doppler velocimeter and MRA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Stenosis of the vertebral arteries caused by stretch, localized compression, or kinking. RESULTS: All 16 vertebral arteries from the 8 patients displayed no changes in their lumen dimensions with full cervical rotation, although curves in each of the arteries did change. The model and cadaveric vertebral arteries demonstrated localized compression or kinking of the vessel wall with atlanto-axial rotation contralaterally but revealed no evidence of major contribution of stretching to stenosis. CONCLUSION: The lumen of vertebral arteries is usually unaffected by atlanto-axial rotation. In cases where there is stenosis, this is mainly due to localized compression or kinking.

Also, to verify the accuracy of the resulting 3D-printed hollow models of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: The 3DDSA data from 9 aneurysms were processed to obtain volumetric models suitable for the stereolithography apparatus. The resulting models were filled with iodinated contrast media. 3D rotational angiography of the models was carried out, and the aneurysm geometry was compared with the original patient data. The accuracy of the 3D-printed hollow models' sizes and shapes was evaluated using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Dice coefficient index. RESULTS: The aneurysm volumes ranged from 34.1 to 4609.8 mm(3) (maximum diameters 5.1-30.1 mm), and no statistically significant differences were noted between the patient data and the 3D-printed models (P = 0.4).

rotating_wall,22766960,A computational fluid dynamics study on geometrical influence of the aorta on haemodynamics.,"OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and aneurysm, are closely associated with haemodynamic factors that are governed by luminal geometry. The present work aimed to study the effect of geometrical variation of aging aortas on haemodynamics. METHODS: Six aged subjects with intricate geometrical features, such as bulging or twisted supra-aortic arteries, sharply curved arch and double-curved descending aorta, were chosen from our medical database. These six geometrically variant aortas were reconstructed and the pulsatile nature of the blood flow of these subject-specific aorta models investigated using computational fluid dynamics simulations. Realistic time-dependent boundary conditions are prescribed for various arteries of the aorta models. RESULTS: This study suggests that haemodynamics in the human aorta is highly dependent on geometrical features. The positioning and contouring of the supra-aortic arteries may be associated with the skewness of velocity profiles. The flow profiles in the aortic arch or bends are generally skewed towards the inner curvature wall and this skewness may give rise to the formation of secondary flow in the inner curvature wall of the distal arch. The degree of vorticity in the distal aortic arch is found to be related to the arch curvature. The helical nature of aortic haemodynamics is predominant in the systole phrase when it begins with a left-handed rotation and then vanishes in the ascending aorta, whereas a right-handed rotation persists in the distal aortic arch. Lower wall shear stress is also found in the ascending regions where secondary flow is present. CONCLUSIONS: The aorta with an irregular contour and large degree of curvature at its arch favours the development of the intra-aortic secondary flow that subsequently relates to the pathogenesis of atheroma. The present study identifies the general trend of haemodynamic behaviours associated with various local geometrical features. Combining the knowledge of the correlation between haemodynamics and the underlying risks in the development of cardiovascular diseases, our study hopes to provide a better understanding of the relationship between aortic morphology and developing pathobiology of cardiovascular diseases. As such, early medical planning as well as surgical interventions can be designed to retard or prevent the development of cardiovascular diseases.",Tse KM; Chang R; Lee HP; Lim SP; Venkatesh SK; Ho P,,2013,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

The probability of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases could be effectively reduced by swirling blood flow. In this study, first we proposed a new integrated vascular model with spiral folds on the inner wall. Based on the model, fluid-solid coupling simulation analyses of blood and blood vessels were performed. The results indicate that the spiral folds cause the swirling flow. This model provides new insights that may be of use for developing methods to generate swirling flow. Second, we discussed the specific effects of different fold parameters' characteristics on swirling flow. We found that increasing the pitch or cross-sectional area enhanced the swirling flow, specifically increasing cross-sectional diameter by 0.2 mm, wall shear stress by about 2 mm Hg, and deformation by about 0.2 µm. Finally, we proposed a new method to prepare an integrated artificial blood vessel based on the heteromorphic channel co-extrusion method; the inner wall of this blood vessel had a spiral fold structure and was micron scale in width.

rotating_wall,21818636,Effects of wall shear stress and its gradient on tumor cell adhesion in curved microvessels.,"Tumor cell adhesion to vessel walls in the microcirculation is one critical step in cancer metastasis. In this paper, the hypothesis that tumor cells prefer to adhere at the microvessels with localized shear stresses and their gradients, such as in the curved microvessels, was examined both experimentally and computationally. Our in vivo experiments were performed on the microvessels (post-capillary venules, 30-50 μm diameter) of rat mesentery. A straight or curved microvessel was cannulated and perfused with tumor cells by a glass micropipette at a velocity of ~1mm/s. At less than 10 min after perfusion, there was a significant difference in cell adhesion to the straight and curved vessel walls. In 60 min, the averaged adhesion rate in the curved vessels (n = 14) was ~1.5-fold of that in the straight vessels (n = 19). In 51 curved segments, 45% of cell adhesion was initiated at the inner side, 25% at outer side, and 30% at both sides of the curved vessels. To investigate the mechanical mechanism by which tumor cells prefer adhering at curved sites, we performed a computational study, in which the fluid dynamics was carried out by the lattice Boltzmann method , and the tumor cell dynamics was governed by the Newton's law of translation and rotation. A modified adhesive dynamics model that included the influence of wall shear stress/gradient on the association/dissociation rates of tumor cell adhesion was proposed, in which the positive wall shear stress/gradient jump would enhance tumor cell adhesion while the negative wall shear stress/gradient jump would weaken tumor cell adhesion. It was found that the wall shear stress/gradient, over a threshold, had significant contribution to tumor cell adhesion by activating or inactivating cell adhesion molecules. Our results elucidated why the tumor cell adhesion prefers to occur at the positive curvature of curved microvessels with very low Reynolds number (in the order of 10(-2)) laminar flow.",Yan WW; Cai B; Liu Y; Fu BM,,2012,Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",SC1 CA153325/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; 1SC1CA153325-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,

The morphologic parameters were measured and calculated from patient-specific 3D rotational angiographic images, and pulsatile computational fluid dynamic simulation was then performed for hemodynamic parameters. RESULTS: There was no significant statistical difference between the 2 groups in size, aspect ratio, size ratio, aneurysm angle, or vessel angle; analysis only demonstrated a significantly lower wall shear stress of the aneurysm wall in the symptomatic unruptured group in hemodynamics (P = .024), whereas there were no differences in wall shear stress of the parent artery, low wall shear stress area, and oscillatory shear index.

rotating_wall,22460266,Automated method for tracking vasomotion of intravital microvascular and microlymphatic vessels.,"Dynamic tracking of microvascular and microlymphatic vasomotion presents a critical image processing technique in the evaluation of function and dysfunction of the microvasculature. Many methods for determination of diameter changes have been reported. Previous methods which were specifically developed for vasomotion tracking of intravital, fluorescence-free, rapidly constricting microvascular and microlymphatic vessels have various limitations due to complex image background, vessel wall distortion, image drift, noise and other artifacts. In order to overcome these major obstacles and remove undesirable limitations, this study proposed a tracking strategy based on feature matching of moving object-VasTrack. First, we calculate the image drift vector by feature template matching of a landmark in the background. Second, dynamically regulate the position of a sample line in accordance with the drift vector for sustaining the consistency of measurement location. Third, dynamically recognize and track edge position changes by applying feature template matching using edge context. This method does not require special preprocessing of video image registration and rotation. VasTrack compensates efficiently for image drift and vessel wall distortion, can simultaneously track and determine vessel diameters at any orientation and in multiple locations. Testing proved that VasTrack is robust and accurate, and will satisfy the needs of basic microcirculatory research and clinical inspection.",Sheng YM; Xiu RJ,,2012,Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,30469448,A 40-MHz Ultrasound Transducer with an Angled Aperture for Guiding Percutaneous Revascularization of Chronic Total Occlusion: A Feasibility Study.,"Complete blockage of a coronary artery, called chronic total occlusion (CTO), frequently occurs due to atherosclerosis. To reopen the obstructed blood vessels with a stent, guidewire crossing is performed with the help of angiography that can provide the location of CTO lesions and the image of guidewire tip. Since angiography is incapable of imaging inside a CTO lesion, the surgeons are blind during guidewire crossing. For this reason, the success rate of guidewire crossing relies upon the proficiency of the surgeon, which is considerably reduced from 69.0% to 32.5% if extensive calcification, not penetrated by a guidewire, exists in CTO lesions. In this paper, a recently developed 40-MHz forward-looking intravascular ultrasound (FL⁻IVUS) transducer to visualize calcification within CTO lesions is reported. This transducer consists of a single element angled aperture and a guidewire passage. The aperture is spherically deformed to have a focal length of 3 mm in order to improve spatial resolution of FL⁻IVUS images. The angle between the beam direction and the axis of rotation is designed to be 30° to effectively visualize calcification within a CTO lesion as well as the blood vessel wall. The experimental results demonstrated that the developed FL⁻IVUS transducer facilitates visualization of calcification within CTO lesions and makes it possible to help the surgeon make decisions about whether to push the guidewire in order to cross the lesion or to change the surgical procedure.",Lee J; Chang JH,atherosclerosis; chronic total occlusion; forward-looking IVUS; guidewire crossing; high-frequency ultrasound; intravascular ultrasound (IVUS); percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); ultrasound transducers,2018,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Journal Article,"10052980/Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy/",
rotating_wall,35924481,ECG-I phenotyping of persistent AF based on driver burden and distribution to predict response to pulmonary vein isolation (PHENOTYPE-AF).,"BACKGROUND: This prospective trial sought to phenotype persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) based on AF mechanisms using electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) mapping to determine whether this would predict long-term freedom from arrhythmia after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). METHODS: Patients with persistent AF of <2 years duration underwent cryoballoon PVI. ECGI mapping was performed before PVI to determine potential drivers (PDs) defined as rotational activations completing ≥1.5 revolutions or focal activations. The coprimary endpoint was the association between (1) PD burden (defined as the number of PD occurrences) and (2) PD distribution (defined as the number of segments on an 18-segment model of the atria harboring PDs) with freedom from arrhythmia at 1-year follow up. RESULTS: Of 100 patients, 97 completed follow up and 52 (53.6%) remained in sinus rhythm off antiarrhythmic drugs. Neither PD burden nor PD distribution predicted freedom from arrhythmia (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99-1.03, p = .164; and HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.91-1.17, p = .591, respectively). Otherwise, the burden of rotational PDs, rotational stability, and the burden of PDs occurring at the pulmonary veins and posterior wall all failed to predict arrhythmia recurrence (all p > .10). CONCLUSIONS: AF mechanisms as determined using ECGI mapping do not predict outcomes after PVI for persistent AF. Further studies using different methodologies to characterize AF mechanisms are warranted (NCT03394404).",Dhillon GS; Honarbakhsh S; Graham A; Abbass H; Welch S; Daw H; Sporton S; Providencia R; Chow A; Earley MJ; Lowe M; Lambiase PD; Schilling RJ; Hunter RJ,ECGI; drivers of AF; mechanisms of persistent AF; noninvasive mapping,2022,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Medtronic/,
rotating_wall,17614322,Oxygen transport and consumption by suspended cells in microgravity: a multiphase analysis.,"A rotating bioreactor for the cell/tissue culture should be operated to obtain sufficient nutrient transfer and avoid damage to the culture materials. Thus, the objective of the present study is to determine the appropriate suspension conditions for the bead/cell distribution and evaluate oxygen transport in the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. A numerical analysis of the RWV bioreactor is conducted by incorporating the Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase and oxygen transport equations. The bead size and rotating speed are the control variables in the calculations. The present results show that the rotating speed for appropriate suspensions needs to be increased as the size of the bead/cell increases: 10 rpm for 200 microm; 12 rpm for 300 microm; 14 rpm for 400 microm; 18 rpm for 600 microm. As the rotating speed and the bead size increase from 10 rpm/200 microm to 18 rpm/600 microm, the mean oxygen concentration in the 80% midzone of the vessel is increased by approximately 85% after 1-h rotation due to the high convective flow for 18 rpm/600 microm case as compared to 10 rpm/200 microm case. The present results may serve as criteria to set the operating parameters for a RWV bioreactor, such as the size of beads and the rotating speed, according to the growth of cell aggregates. In addition, it might provide a design parameter for an advanced suspension bioreactor for 3-D engineered cell and tissue cultures.",Kwon O; Devarakonda SB; Sankovic JM; Banerjee RK,,2008,Biotechnology and bioengineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,22243004,Stabilization of the resistive wall mode by a rotating solid conductor.,"Stabilization of the resistive wall mode (RWM) by high-speed differentially rotating conducting walls is demonstrated in the laboratory. To observe stabilization intrinsic azimuthal plasma rotation must be braked with error fields. Above a critical error field the RWM frequency discontinuously slows (locks) and fast growth subsequently occurs. Wall rotation is found to reduce the locked RWM saturated amplitude and growth rate, with both static (vacuum vessel) wall locked and slowly rotating RWMs observed depending on the alignment of wall to plasma rotation. At high wall rotation RWM onset is found to occur at larger plasma currents, thus increasing the RWM-stable operation window.",Paz-Soldan C; Brookhart MI; Eckhart AT; Hannum DA; Hegna CC; Sarff JS; Forest CB,,2011,Physical review letters,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,30488307,The Atheroprotective Nature of Helical Flow in Coronary Arteries.,"Arterial hemodynamics is markedly characterized by the presence of helical flow patterns. Previous observations suggest that arterial helical blood flow is of physiological significance, and that its quantitative analysis holds promise for clinical applications. In particular, it has been reported that distinguishable helical flow patterns are potentially atheroprotective in the carotid bifurcation as they suppress flow disturbances. In this context, there is a knowledge gap about the physiological significance of helical flow in coronary arteries, a prominent site of atherosclerotic plaque formation. This study aimed at the quantitative assessment of helical blood flow in coronary arteries, and to investigate its possible associations with vascular geometry and with atherogenic wall shear stress (WSS) phenotypes in a representative sample of 30 swine coronary arteries. This study demonstrates that in coronary arteries: (1) the hemodynamics is characterized by counter-rotating bi-helical flow structures; (2) unfavorable conditions of WSS are strongly and inversely associated with helicity intensity (r = - 0.91; p < 0.001), suggesting an atheroprotective role for helical flow in the coronary tree; (3) vascular torsion dictates helical flow features (r = 0.64; p < 0.001). The findings of this work support future studies on the role of helical flow in atherogenesis in coronary arteries.",De Nisco G; Kok AM; Chiastra C; Gallo D; Hoogendoorn A; Migliavacca F; Wentzel JJ; Morbiducci U,Atherosclerosis; Computational fluid dynamics; Geometry; Helicity; Wall shear stress,2019,Annals of biomedical engineering,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,11370806,3D bone tissue engineered with bioactive microspheres in simulated microgravity.,"Three-dimensional (3D) osteoblast cell cultures were obtained in rotating-wall vessels (RWV), simulating microgravity. Three types of bioactive microcarriers, specifically modified bioactive glass particles, bioceramic hollow microspheres, and biodegradable bioactive glass-polymer composite microspheres, were developed and used with osteoblasts. The surfaces of composite microspheres fully transformed into bone apatite after 2-wk immersion in simulated physiological fluid, which demonstrated their bone-bonding ability. The motion of microcarriers in RWVs was photographically recorded and numerically analyzed. The trajectories of hollow microspheres showed that they migrated and eventually stayed around at the central region of the RWV. At their surfaces, shear stresses were low. In contrast, solid glass or polymer particles moved toward and finally bounced off the outer wall of the RWVs. Cell culture studies in the RWV using bone marrow stromal cells showed that the cells attached to and formed 3D aggregates with the hollow microspheres. Extracellular matrix and mineralization were observed in the aggregates. Cell culture studies also confirmed the ability of the composite microspheres to support 3D bone-like tissue formation. These data suggest that the new hollow bioceramic microspheres and degradable composite microspheres can be used as microcarriers for 3D bone tissue engineering in microgravity. They also have potential applications as drug delivery systems.",Qiu QQ; Ducheyne P; Ayyaswamy PS,,2001,In vitro cellular & developmental biology. Animal,Journal Article,,

rotating_wall,31663837,Changes in internal carotid and vertebral arterial wall stiffness with head movement can be detected with shear wave elastography.,"Background: Safe practice is important for patients with neck pain, with the potential for injury to cervical arteries. Cervical manipulation or end range techniques/positions may place considerable strain on the arteries. Altered integrity of the arterial wall may render them more susceptible to minor trauma, particularly in the upper cervical region. Screening of blood flow velocity is limited for predicting those at risk. Examining properties of the cervical arterial wall (stiffness characteristics) and their response to head movement may provide an alternate measure of arterial susceptibility.Objectives: To investigate whether shear wave ultrasound elastography can detect any changes in internal carotid (ICA) and vertebral (VA) arterial wall stiffness in neutral compared with contralateral head rotation.Design: Observational studyMethods: Shear wave ultrasound elastography was used to measure the stiffness of the ICA and VA. Shear wave velocity (m/s), indicative of arterial stiffness, was measured in both arteries proximally (C3-4) and distally (C1-2) in neutral and contralateral head rotation as were intimal thickness (mm) and flow velocity (cm/s).Results: Thirty participants (20-62 years) were successfully imaged. The VA was stiffer than ICA and it became significantly stiffer in contralateral rotation (p = 0.05). The ICA became significantly less stiff (p = 0.01). Effects were more apparent at C1-2 but significant in the ICA only (p = 0.03). Flow velocity and intimal thickness were unchanged in rotation.Conclusions: Changes in VA and ICA arterial wall stiffness can be measured with shear wave ultrasound elastography. This measure may ultimately help identify arteries with greater vulnerability to rotational stresses.",Thomas LC; Chan K; Durbridge G,Cervical artery; elasticity imaging techniques; head movements; vascular stiffness,2020,The Journal of manual & manipulative therapy,"Journal Article; Observational Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,17391901,Evaluation of endovenous radiofrequency ablation and laser therapy with endoluminal optical coherence tomography in an ex vivo model.,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the ability of endovascular optical coherence tomography (eOCT) to detect qualitative tissue alteration and quantitative changes of vein wall thickness and vein lumen diameter comparing endovenous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and endovenous laser therapy (ELT) in an established ex vivo model. METHODS: Endoluminal eOCT was performed by means of a new prototype rotating system (System M1, LightLab Imaging Inc, Boston, Mass) with automatic pullback of 1 mm/s. In the course of an eOCT examination of a 50-mm vein segment, 264 electronic cross section images with a spatial resolution of 15 to 20 mum are acquired. The eOCT scans were performed before and after treatment of each of 13 treated vein segments and of six control vein segments. Thirteen subcutaneous cow foot veins were reperfused in situ, and the defined 50-mm vein segments in the study were treated with RFA (n = 2) and ELT (n = 11). RFA followed the clinical VNUS-Closure protocol (VNUS Medical Technologies, San Jose, Calif) using a 6F 60-mm Closure-Plus catheter. ELT was performed using light of lambda = 980 nm with a laser power of 3 (n = 2), 5 (n = 2), and 7 W (n = 4) with a paced pullback protocol with laser irradiation for 1.5 seconds every 3 mm, resulting in linear endovenous energy densities (LEED) of 15, 25, and 35 J/cm. Using 11 W (n = 3) with a continuous pullback protocol at 3 mm/s resulted in a LEED of 36.5 J/cm. Ten histologic cross sections of each treated and control vein segment were correlated with the corresponding eOCT cross sections to evaluate qualitative representation of vein wall layers and tissue alterations such as ablation and vein wall perforation. In addition, 26 eOCT cross sections of every treated vein segment before and after treatment and every control vein segment were analyzed to calculate quantitative changes in media thickness and vein lumen diameter. RESULTS: In all specimens, qualitative analysis with eOCT demonstrated a clear match with histologic cross sections. A symmetrical, complete, circular disintegration of intima and media structures, without any transmural tissue defects, was shown after RFA. Pronounced semicircular tissue ablations (3 to 14 per 50 mm) and complete vessel wall perforations (0 to 16 per 50 mm) were detected after ELT. The quantitative analysis demonstrated a significant (P < .0001) increase in intima-media thickness after RFA (37.8% to 66.7%) and ELT (11.1% to 45.7%). A significant (P < .0001) reduction of vessel lumen diameter (36.3% to 42.2%) was found after RFA. Owing to the limited number of treated vein segments and inhomogeneous baseline vein lumen diameters, no linear correlation between laser energy level and effects on tissue such as ablation/perforation, media thickening, or vein lumen diameter could be identified. CONCLUSIONS: In our ex vivo cow foot model, eOCT is able to reproduce normal vein wall structures and endovenous acute thermal alterations, such as tissue ablation and vessel wall perforations. Endovenous eOCT images can also be analyzed quantitatively to measure media thickness or vein lumen diameter. Endovascular OCT could become a valuable alternative tool for morphologic investigation of tissue alterations after endovenous thermal procedures.",Schmedt CG; Meissner OA; Hunger K; Babaryka G; Ruppert V; Sadeghi-Azandaryani M; Steckmeier BM; Sroka R,,2007,Journal of vascular surgery,Evaluation Study; Journal Article,,

Three hundred patients were recruited, and ultrasound examination of the SCV was performed. Then, the patients were divided into two groups and SCV catheterization was performed: ultrasound-guided catheterization with the aiming method (group A) and ultrasound-guided catheterization with needle guide (group NG). The success rate, insertion time, number of skin breaks, number of needle redirections, needle visibility and rate of mechanical complications were documented and compared for each procedure. To depict the optimum long-axis view of the SCV, there was a 30° ± 7.3° angle (rotation) between the long axis of the ultrasound probe and the clavicle, while there was a 39° ± 7.4° angle (tilt) between the ultrasound beam plane and the right chest wall. The aiming method was associated with fewer skin breaks [(mean (IQR): 1 (1-1) times vs 1 (1-2) times, P = 0.009], a shorter time to cannulation [(mean (IQR): 39 (32-48.5) s vs 48 (44-54.8) s, P = 0.000] and more needle redirections [(mean (IQR): 0 (0-1) vs 0 (0-0), P = 0.000]. There were no differences between group A and group NG in the overall success rate, first puncture success rate, needle visibility or mechanical complication rate. In conclusion, during ultrasound-guided in-plane catheterization of the SCV, the aiming method provides comparable needle-beam alignment with a lower cannulation time than the needle guide technique.",Mao Q; He H; Lu Y; Hu Y; Wang Z; Gan M; Chen L; Yan H,,2021,Scientific reports,"Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,34104946,Aortic flow dynamics and stiffness in Loeys-Dietz syndrome patients: a comparison with healthy volunteers and Marfan syndrome patients.,"AIMS: To assess aortic flow and stiffness in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) by 4D flow and cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and compare the results with those of healthy volunteers (HV) and Marfan syndrome (MFS) patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-one LDS and 44 MFS patients with no previous aortic dissection or surgery and 35 HV underwent non-contrast-enhanced 4D flow CMR. In-plane rotational flow (IRF), systolic flow reversal ratio (SFRR), and aortic diameters were obtained at 20 planes from the ascending (AAo) to the proximal descending aorta (DAo). IRF and SFRR were also quantified for aortic regions (proximal and distal AAo, arch and proximal DAo). Peak-systolic wall shear stress (WSS) maps were also estimated. Aortic stiffness was quantified using pulse wave velocity (PWV) and proximal AAo longitudinal strain. Compared to HV, LDS patients had lower rotational flow at the distal AAo (P = 0.002), arch (P = 0.002), and proximal DAo (P < 0.001) even after adjustment for age, stroke volume, and local diameter. LDS patients had higher SFRR in the proximal DAo compared to both HV (P = 0.024) and MFS patients (P = 0.015), even after adjustment for age and local diameter. Axial and circumferential WSS in LDS patients were lower than in HV. AAo circumferential WSS was lower in LDS compared to MFS patients. AAo and DAo PWV and proximal AAo longitudinal strain revealed stiffer aortas in LDS patients compared to HV (P = 0.007, 0.005, and 0.029, respectively) but no differences vs. MFS patients. CONCLUSION: Greater aortic stiffness as well as impaired IRF and WSS were present in LDS patients compared to HV. Conversely, similar aortic stiffness and overlapping aortic flow features were found in Loeys-Dietz and Marfan patients. The Author(s) 2021.

rotating_wall,16914036,Microvascular engineering in perfusion culture: immunohistochemistry and CLSM findings.,"BACKGROUND: One of the most challenging problems in tissue engineering is the establishment of vascular supply. A possible approach might be the engineering of microvasculature in vitro and the supply by engineered feeder vessels. METHODS: An in vitro model for a small-diameter vessel was developed and made from adipose tissue stromal cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a tube-like gelatine scaffold. The number of ""branches"" emerging from the central lumen and the morphology of the central lumen of the vessel equivalent were assessed after 16 days of either pulsatile perfusion culture or culture in rotating containers by evaluation of immunohistochemically stained sections (n = 6 pairs of cultures). Intramural capillary network formation was demonstrated in five experiments with confocal laser scanning microscopy. RESULTS: Perfused specimens showed a round or oval lumen lined by a single layer of endothelial cells, whereas following rotation culture the lumen tended to collapse. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed more extended network formation in perfused specimens as compared to specimens after rotation culture. Partially highly interconnected capillary-like networks were imaged which showed orientation around the central lumen. Perfused specimens exhibited significantly more branches emerging from the central lumen. There were, however, hardly any capillary branches crossing the whole vessel wall. CONCLUSION: Pulsatile perfusion supports the development of vascular networks with physiological appearance. Advances in reactor development, acquisition of functional data and imaging procedures are however necessary in order to attain the ultimate goal of a fully functional engineered supplying vessel.",Frerich B; Zückmantel K; Hemprich A,,2006,Head & face medicine,Journal Article,,

In this study, we used a novel photo-curable cytocompatible polyacrylate material (PA) for freeform generation of synthetic vessels. We applied stereolithography for the fabrication of arbitrary 3D tubular structures with total dimensions in the centimeter range, 300 µm wall thickness, inner diameters of 1 to 2 mm and defined pores with a constant diameter of approximately 100 µm or 200 µm. We established a rinsing protocol to remove remaining cytotoxic substances from the photo-cured PA and applied thio-modified heparin and RGDC-peptides to functionalize the PA surface for enhanced endothelial cell adhesion. A rotating seeding procedure was introduced to ensure homogenous endothelial monolayer formation at the inner luminal tube wall. We showed that endothelial cells stayed viable and adherent and aligned along the medium flow under fluid-flow conditions comparable to native capillaries.

rotating_wall,31607265,Decreased rotational flow and circumferential wall shear stress as early markers of descending aorta dilation in Marfan syndrome: a 4D flow CMR study.,"BACKGROUND: Diseases of the descending aorta have emerged as a clinical issue in Marfan syndrome following improvements in proximal aorta surgical treatment and the consequent increase in life expectancy. Although a role for hemodynamic alterations in the etiology of descending aorta disease in Marfan patients has been suggested, whether flow characteristics may be useful as early markers remains to be determined. METHODS: Seventy-five Marfan patients and 48 healthy subjects were prospectively enrolled. In- and through-plane vortexes were computed by 4D flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in the thoracic aorta through the quantification of in-plane rotational flow and systolic flow reversal ratio, respectively. Regional pulse wave velocity and axial and circumferential wall shear stress maps were also computed. RESULTS: In-plane rotational flow and circumferential wall shear stress were reduced in Marfan patients in the distal ascending aorta and in proximal descending aorta, even in the 20 patients free of aortic dilation. Multivariate analysis showed reduced in-plane rotational flow to be independently related to descending aorta pulse wave velocity. Conversely, systolic flow reversal ratio and axial wall shear stress were altered in unselected Marfan patients but not in the subgroup without dilation. In multivariate regression analysis proximal descending aorta axial (p = 0.014) and circumferential (p = 0.034) wall shear stress were independently related to local diameter. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced rotational flow is present in the aorta of Marfan patients even in the absence of dilation, is related to aortic stiffness and drives abnormal circumferential wall shear stress. Axial and circumferential wall shear stress are independently related to proximal descending aorta dilation beyond clinical factors. In-plane rotational flow and circumferential wall shear stress may be considered as an early marker of descending aorta dilation in Marfan patients.",Guala A; Teixido-Tura G; Dux-Santoy L; Granato C; Ruiz-Muñoz A; Valente F; Galian-Gay L; Gutiérrez L; González-Alujas T; Johnson KM; Wieben O; Sao Avilés A; Evangelista A; Rodriguez-Palomares J,4D flow CMR; Aortic aneurysm; Descending aorta; Helical flow; Marfan syndrome; Wall shear stress (WSS),2019,Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Video-Audio Media",,

In this approach, partially cross-linked hollow alginate filaments loading fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells were extruded through a coaxial nozzle and then printed along a rotated rod template, and endothelial cells were seeded into the inner wall. Because of the fusion of adjacent hollow filaments, two-level fluidic channels, including a macro-channel in the middle formed from the cylindrical template and a microchannel around the wall resulted from the hollow filaments were formed. By this method, different shapes of vessellike structures of millimeter diameter were printed. The structures printed using 4% alginate exhibited ultimate strength of 0.184 MPa, and L929 mouse fibroblasts encapsulated in the structures showed over 90% survival within 1 week.

rotating_wall,30830909,Effect of valve lesion on venous valve cycle: A modified immersed finite element modeling.,"The present study aimed to understand the effect of venous valve lesion on the valve cycle. A modified immersed finite element method was used to model the blood-tissue interactions in the pathological vein. The contact process between leaflets or between leaflet and sinus was evaluated using an adhesive contact method. The venous valve modeling was validated by comparing the results of the healthy valve with those of experiments and other simulations. Four valve lesions induced by the abnormal elasticity variation were considered for the unhealthy valve: fibrosis, atrophy, incomplete fibrosis, and incomplete atrophy. The opening orifice area was inversely proportional to the structural stiffness of the valve, while the transvalvular flow velocity was proportional to the structural stiffness of the valve. The stiffening of the fibrotic leaflet led to a decrease in the orifice area and a stronger jet. The leaflet and blood wall shear stress (WSS) in fibrosis was the highest. The softening of the atrophic leaflet resulted in overly soft behavior. The venous incompetence and reflux were observed in atrophy. Also, the atrophic leaflet in incomplete atrophy exhibited weak resistance to the hemodynamic action, and the valve was reluctant to be closed owing to the large rotation of the healthy leaflet. Low blood WSS and maximum leaflet WSS existed in all the cases. A less biologically favorable condition was found especially in the fibrotic leaflet, involving a higher mechanical cost. This study provided an insight into the venous valve lesion, which might help understand the valve mechanism of the diseased vein. These findings will be more useful when the biology is also understood. Thus, more biological studies are needed.",Liu X; Liu L,,2019,PloS one,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Polyurethane (PU) grafts were fabricated by electrospinning as fine-mesh, low-porosity grafts (void fraction (VF) 53%) and coarse-mesh, high-porosity grafts (VF 80%). The fabricated grafts were evaluated in vitro for endothelial cell attachment and proliferation. Prostheses were investigated in a rat model for either 7 days, 1, 3 or 6 months (n=7 per time point) and analyzed after retrieval by biomechanical analysis and various histological techniques. Cell migration was calculated by computer-assisted morphometry. In vitro, fine-pore mesh favored early cell attachment. In vivo, coarse mesh grafts revealed significantly higher cell populations at all time points in all areas of the conduit wall. Biomechanical tests indicated sufficient compliance, tensile and suture retention strength before and after implantation. Increased porosity improves host cell ingrowth and survival in electrospun conduits.

rotating_wall,25062932,Curvature effect on hemodynamic conditions at the inner bend of the carotid siphon and its relation to aneurysm formation.,"Although high-impact hemodynamic forces are thought to lead to cerebral aneurysmal change, little is known about the aneurysm formation on the inner aspect of vascular bends such as the internal carotid artery (ICA) siphon where wall shear stress (WSS) is expected to be low. This study evaluates the effect of vessel curvature and hemodynamics on aneurysm formation along the inner carotid siphon. Catheter 3D-rotational angiographic volumes of 35 ICA (10 aneurysms, 25 controls) were evaluated in 3D for radius of curvature and peak curvature of the siphon bend, followed by univariate statistical analysis. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed on patient-derived models after aneurysm removal and on synthetic variants of increasing curvature. Peak focal siphon curvature was significantly higher in aneurysm bearing ICAs (0.36 ± 0.045 vs. 0.30 ± 0.048 mm(-1), p=0.003), with no difference in global radius of curvature (p=0.36). In CFD simulations, increasing parametric curvature tightness (from 5 to 3mm radius) resulted in dramatic increase of WSS and WSS gradient magnitude (WSSG) on the inner wall of the bend. In patient-derived data, the location of aneurysms coincided with regions of low WSS (<4 Pa) flanked by high WSS and WSSG peaks. WSS peaks correlated with the aneurysm neck. In contrast, control siphon bends displayed low, almost constant, WSS and WSSG profiles with little spatial variation. High bend curvature induces dynamically fluctuating high proximal WSS and WSSG followed by regions of flow stasis and recirculation, leading to local conditions known to induce destructive vessel wall remodeling and aneurysmal initiation.",Lauric A; Hippelheuser J; Safain MG; Malek AM,Aneurysm formation; Internal carotid artery; Intracranial aneurysm; Vessel curvature,2014,Journal of biomechanics,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",R21 HL102685/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; R21HL102685/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,18367381,Maturation of capillary-like structures in a tube-like construct in perfusion and rotation culture.,"In an effort to engineer capillary-like networks in vitro, different cultivation methods were compared. Five small-diameter tube-like constructs ('vessel equivalents') were fabricated from porcine gelatin scaffolds and seeded with human adipose tissue stromal cells and umbilical vein endothelial cells. After initial growth, the vessel equivalents were divided. One segment was exposed to pulsatile perfusion and the other was kept in rotating culture. Specimens harvested at the start of the experiments and after 16 days of rotation or perfusion were compared histomorphometrically with respect to capillary-like network formation in the vessel wall. Most capillary-like structures were found in the luminal portion of perfused vessel equivalents.

rotating_wall,35027345,4D Flat Panel Conebeam CTA for Analysis of the Angioarchitecture of Cerebral AVMs with a Novel Software Prototype.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Time-resolved 3DRA (4D-DSA) and flat panel conebeam CTA are new methods for visualizing the microangioarchitecture of cerebral AVMs. We applied a 4D software prototype to a series of cases of AVMs to assess the utility of this method in relation to treatment planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 33 patients with AVMs, 4D volumes and flat panel conebeam CTA images were recalculated from existing 3D rotational angiography data. The multiplanar reconstructions were used to determine intranidal arteriovenous branching patterns, categorize them according to common classifications of AVM angioarchitecture, and compare the results with those from 2D-DSA. RESULTS: 4D flat panel conebeam CTA showed angioarchitectural features equal to or better than those of 2D-DSA in 30 of 33 cases. In particular, the reconstructions helped in understanding the intranidal microvasculature. Fistulous direct arteriovenous connections with a low degree of arterial branching (n = 22) could be distinguished from plexiform arterial networks before the transition to draining veins (n = 11). We identified AVMs with a single draining vein (n = 20) or multiple draining veins (n = 10). Arteriovenous shunts in the lateral wall of the draining veins (n = 22) could be distinguished from cases with increased venous branching and shunts between corresponding intranidal arteries and veins (n = 11). Limitations were the time-consuming postprocessing and the difficulties in correctly tracing intranidal vessels in larger and complex AVMs. CONCLUSIONS: 4D flat panel conebeam CTA reconstructions allow detailed analysis of the nidal angioarchitecture of AVMs. However, further improvements in temporal resolution and automated reconstruction techniques are needed to use the method generally in clinical practice.",Keil F; Bergkemper A; Birkhold A; Kowarschik M; Tritt S; Berkefeld J,,2022,AJNR.

rotating_wall,8964115,Arterial remodeling after coronary angioplasty: a serial intravascular ultrasound study.,"BACKGROUND: Restenosis occurs after 30% to 50% of transcatheter coronary procedures; however, the natural history and pathophysiology of restenosis are still incompletely understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: Serial (postintervention and follow-up) intravascular ultrasound imaging was used to study 212 native coronary lesions in 209 patients after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, directional coronary atherectomy, rotational atherectomy, or excimer laser angioplasty. The external elastic membrane (EEM) and lumen cross-sectional areas (CSA) were measured; plaque plus media (P+M) CSA was calculated as EEM minus lumen CSA. The anatomic slice selected for serial analysis had an axial location within the target lesion at the smallest follow-up lumen CSA. At follow-up, 73% of the decrease in lumen (from 6.6+/-2.5 to 4.0+/-3.7 mm2, P<.0001) was due to a decrease in EEM (from 20.1+/-6.4 to 18.2+/-6.4 mm2, P<.0001); 27% was due to an increase in P+M (from 13.5+/-5.5 to 14.2+/-5.4 mm2, P<.0001). Delta Lumen CSA correlated more strongly with delta EEM CSA (r=.751, P<.0001) than with delta P+M CSA (r=.284, P<.0001). Delta EEM was bidirectional; 47 lesions (22%) showed an increase in EEM. Despite a greater increase in P+M (1.5+/-2.5 versus 0.5+/-2.0 mm2, P=.0009), lesions exhibiting an increase in EEM had (1) no change in lumen (-0.1+/-3.3 versus 3.6+/-2.3 mm2, P<.0001), (2) a reduced restenosis rate (26% versus 62%, P<.0001), and (3) a 49% frequency of late lumen gain (versus 1%, P<.0001) compared with lesions with no increase in EEM. CONCLUSIONS: Restenosis appears to be determined primarily by the direction and magnitude of vessel wall remodeling (delta EEM). An increase in EEM is adaptive, whereas a decrease in EEM contributes to restenosis.",Mintz GS; Popma JJ; Pichard AD; Kent KM; Satler LF; Wong C; Hong MK; Kovach JA; Leon MB,,1996,Circulation,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

We sought to generate normal values and elucidate changes of helical flow (duration, volume, length, velocities and rotational direction) and flow jet (displacement, flow angle) as well as wall shear stress (WSS). METHODS: We assessed the temporal helical existence (TH(EX)), maximum helical volume (HV(max)), accumulated helical volume (HV(acc)), accumulated helical volume length (HVL(acc)), maximum forward velocity (maxV(for)), maximum circumferential velocity (maxV(circ)), rotational direction (RD) and maximum wall shear stress (WSS) as reported elsewhere using the software tool Bloodline in 86 healthy volunteers (46 females, mean age 41 ± 13 years). RESULTS: WSS decreased by 42.1% and maxV(for) by 55.7% across age. There was no link between age and gender regarding the other parameters. CONCLUSION: This study provides age-dependent normal values regarding WSS and maxV(for) and age- and gender-independent normal values regarding TH(EX), HV(max), HV(acc), HVL(acc), RD and (max)V(circ).

After the failure of a sartorious rotational muscle flap transposition into the infected groin wound, this 'high-grade' vascular graft infection was finally treated successfully by wrapping a great saphenous vein patch reinforcement circumferentially around the damaged biological vascular conduit and filling the infected wound with a rectus abdominis myocutaneous muscle flap transposition. The aim of this report is to illustrate this novel, to our knowledge, 'perivascular venous banding' technique and to evaluate the prospective of future testing of this surgical procedure. Starting from this singular case, we will also review the role of the rotational muscle flaps in the conservative management of major vascular graft infections.",De Santis F; Chaves Brait CM; Caravelli G; Pompei S; Di Cintio V,,2013,Vascular,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,,
rotating_wall,24116140,Effect of change in spindle structure on proliferation inhibition of osteosarcoma cells and osteoblast under simulated microgravity during incubation in rotating bioreactor.,"In order to study the effect of microgravity on the proliferation of mammalian osteosarcoma cells and osteoblasts, the changes in cell proliferation, spindle structure, expression of MAD2 or BUB1, and effect of MAD2 or BUB1 on the inhibition of cell proliferation is investigated by keeping mammalian osteosarcoma cells and osteoblasts under simulated microgravity in a rotating wall vessel (2D-RWVS) bioreactor. Experimental results indicate that the effect of microgravity on proliferation inhibition, incidence of multipolar spindles, and expression of MAD2 or BUB1 increases with the extension of treatment time. And multipolar cells enter mitosis after MAD2 or BUB1 is knocked down, which leads to the decrease in DNA content, and decrease the accumulation of cells within multipolar spindles. It can therefore be concluded that simulated microgravity can alter the structure of spindle microtubules, and stimulate the formation of multipolar spindles together with multicentrosomes, which causes the overexpression of SAC proteins to block the abnormal cells in metaphase, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. By clarifying the relationship between cell proliferation inhibition, spindle structure and SAC changes under simulated microgravity, the molecular mechanism and morphology basis of proliferation inhibition induced by microgravity is revealed, which will give experiment and theoretical evidence for the mechanism of space bone loss and some other space medicine problems.",Wei L; Diao Y; Qi J; Khokhlov A; Feng H; Yan X; Li Y,,2013,PloS one,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) served as the standard of reference, using a quantitative approach. METHODS: CTA studies were performed using CT equipment with 320 detector-rows, each 0.5 mm wide, and a gantry rotation time of 0.35 s. All grafts, recipient and nongrafted vessels were deemed interpretable or uninterpretable. The presence of significant (≥50%) stenosis and occlusion were determined on vessel and patient basis. Results were compared to ICA using quantitative coronary angiography. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients (28 men, 76 ± 15 years), with 89 grafts, were included in the study. On a graft analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values in the evaluation of significant stenosis were 96%, 92%, 83% and 98% respectively. The diagnostic accuracy for the assessment of recipient and nongrafted vessels was 89% and 80%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy for the assessment of graft, recipient and nongrafted vessel occlusion was 96%, 92% and 100%, respectively.

The greatest impact of intravascular ultrasound upon clinical decisions may be in the area of cardiac and vascular interventions. To evaluate the utility of intravascular ultrasound, we prospectively studied 45 patients, 11 of whom underwent interventional procedures. Intravascular ultrasound imaging was performed before and after interventions using a 20 MHz, mechanically rotating transducer on either 6.5 Fr or 8.0 Fr catheter systems. Interventions included seven peripheral vessel balloon angioplasties (Femoral artery-two, Renal artery-two, Arteriovenous fistula-two, Aortic coarctation-one), two Femoral artery rotational atherectomies, and two balloon valvuloplasties (Pulmonic valve-1, Mitral valve-1). Intravascular ultrasound and digital angiography provided similar information about vessel size. However, morphological information about the vessel wall, plaque composition, plaque topography, luminal thrombus, and vessel dissections was better appreciated by intravascular ultrasound. Intravascular ultrasound was determined to have provided unique and clinically useful information in 10/11 (91%) interventions. These preliminary data illustrate the potential value of intravascular ultrasound for the evaluation of the vascular system and in particular its value in interventional procedures.",Sheikh KH; Kisslo K; Davidson CJ,,1990,"Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)",Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,33649423,Training model for the intraluminal continuous suturing technique for microvascular anastomosis.,"Microvascular anastomosis is a critical procedure in cerebral bypass surgeries. In some rare cases, the extraluminal interrupted technique is not optimal because the vessels are immobile and cannot be rotated, and anastomosis can be performed effectively through the intraluminal continuous suturing technique. The authors reported the application of the intraluminal continuous suturing technique in microanastomosis training with silicone tube, rat's common iliac arteries and abdominal aorta. A silicone tube with a diameter of 1.5 mm was used to practice microanastomosis in intraluminal continuous suturing technique. Then the technique was applied in side-to-side, end-to-side anastomoses of common iliac arteries and the end-to-end abdominal aorta anastomoses of rat. The suturing time and patency rates were compared with an alternative intraluminal continuous suturing technique and one-way-up interrupted suturing technique in silicone tube and rat vessel anastomoses. The intraluminal continuous suturing technique could be gained through practicing with silicone tube, and the technique has also been demonstrated effective in side-to-side, end-to-side anastomoses of common iliac arteries of rat and the abdominal aorta end-to-end anastomoses. In all the animal experimental groups with different suturing techniques, there was no difference between the patency rates, all the immediate patency rate was 100%. There was no significant suturing time difference between the two intraluminal continuous suturing techniques, but the two intraluminal continuous suturing techniques were faster than the interrupted technique. The intraluminal continuous suturing technique described in the study could be used as an efficient method for side-to-side, end-to-side and end-to-end anastomosis, especially under the situation the posterior wall of the anastomosis could not be rotated. Proficiency of the technique could be achieved through practicing in laboratory with silicone tube and live animals.",Xiao Z; Samii M; Wang J; Pan Q; Xu Z; Ju H,,2021,Scientific reports,Journal Article,,

The development of in vitro systems in which to coculture these cells as multicellular aggregates is very critical. Cell lines were established from cervical tumor cells (n = 6) and two from HUVEC (n = 2) and they were cultured as three-dimensional (3-D) multicellular-cultures using Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads in the rotating wall vessel (RWV). After a 240-h incubation, TEC and HUVEC proliferated exponentially to 4.2 x 10(7) and 2.2 x 10(7) cells/ml, respectively, without requiring a feeder layer; in contrast to the two-dimensional (2-D) cultures that average about 8 x 10(5) cells/ml. Phase contrast microscopy indicated formation of 3-D aggregates that varied in size from 0.5 to 5 mm. The size of the aggregates (1-5 mm, 6-14 microcarriers) increased over time; however, the number of aggregates (0.5-1 mm, 2-5 microcarriers) decreased over a long-term incubation (240 h) because the cells merged to form large clumps. Maximum aggregation was observed with TEC at 120 h and HUVEC at 96 h. The culture of TEC in the absence of HUVEC produced minimal differentiation in contrast to cocultures. The TEC and HUVEC as cocultures in RWV proliferated at an accelerated rate (1.3 x 10(7) cells/ml, 96 h). The TEC-HUVEC coculture presented tubular structures penetrating the tumor cell masses, forming aggregates larger in size than the monocultures and typically with greater cell mass and number. The cells were viable (trypan blue exclusion) and metabolically active (glucose utilization) until 240 h.

rotating_wall,26835725,Experimental and CFD flow studies in an intracranial aneurysm model with Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.,"BACKGROUND: According to the clinical data, flow conditions play a major role in the genesis of intracranial aneurysms. The disorder of the flow structure is the cause of damage of the inner layer of the vessel wall, which leads to the development of cerebral aneurysms. Knowledge of the alteration of the flow field in the aneurysm region is important for treatment. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to study quantitatively the flow structure in an patient-specific aneurysm model of the internal carotid artery using both experimental and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods with Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. METHODS: A patient-specific geometry of aneurysm of the internal carotid artery was used. Patient data was segmented and smoothed to obtain geometrical model. An elastic true-to-scale silicone model was created with stereolithography. For initial investigation of the blood flow, the flow was visualized by adding particles into the silicone model. The precise flow velocity measurements were done using 1D Laser Doppler Anemometer with a spatial resolution of 50 μ m and a temporal resolution of 1 ms. The local velocity measurements were done at a distance of 4 mm to each other. A fluid with non-Newtonian properties was used in the experiment. The CFD simulations for unsteady-state problem were done using constructed hexahedral mesh for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. RESULTS: Using 1D laser Doppler Anemometer the minimum velocity magnitude at the end of systole -0.01 m/s was obtained in the aneurysm dome while the maximum velocity 1 m/s was at the center of the outlet segment. On central cross section of the aneurysm the maximum velocity value is only 20% of the average inlet velocity. The average velocity on the cross-section is only 11% of the inlet axial velocity. Using the CFD simulation the wall shear stresses for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid at the end of systolic phase (t= 0.25 s) were computed. The wall shear stress varies from 3.52 mPa (minimum value) to 10.21 Pa (maximum value) for the Newtonian fluid. For the non-Newtonian fluid the wall shear stress minimum is 2.94 mPa; the maximum is 9.14 Pa. The lowest value of the wall shear stress for both fluids was obtained at the dome of the aneurysm while the highest wall shear stress was at the beginning of the outlet segment. The vortex in the aneurysm region is unstable during the cardiac cycle. The clockwise rotation of the streamlines at the inlet segment for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid is shown. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study are in agreement with the hemodynamics theory of aneurysm genesis. Low value of wall shear stress is observed at the aneurysm dome which can cause a rupture of an aneurysm.",Frolov SV; Sindeev SV; Liepsch D; Balasso A,Hemodynamics; aneurysm genesis; cardiovascular system; cerebral circulation; experimental set-up; flow visualization; laser doppler anemometer; mathematical model,2016,Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,31959203,Highly accelerated 4D flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance using a pseudo-spiral Cartesian acquisition and compressed sensing reconstruction for carotid flow and wall shear stress.,"BACKGROUND: 4D flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) enables visualization of complex blood flow and quantification of biomarkers for vessel wall disease, such as wall shear stress (WSS). Because of the inherently long acquisition times, many efforts have been made to accelerate 4D flow acquisitions, however, no detailed analysis has been made on the effect of Cartesian compressed sensing accelerated 4D flow CMR at different undersampling rates on quantitative flow parameters and WSS. METHODS: We implemented a retrospectively triggered 4D flow CMR acquisition with pseudo-spiral Cartesian k-space filling, which results in incoherent undersampling of k-t space. Additionally, this strategy leads to small jumps in k-space thereby minimizing eddy current related artifacts. The pseudo-spirals were rotated in a tiny golden-angle fashion, which provides optimal incoherence and a variable density sampling pattern with a fully sampled center. We evaluated this 4D flow protocol in a carotid flow phantom with accelerations of R = 2-20, as well as in carotids of 7 healthy subjects (27 ± 2 years, 4 male) for R = 10-30. Fully sampled 2D flow CMR served as a flow reference. Arteries were manually segmented and registered to enable voxel-wise comparisons of both velocity and WSS using a Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: Magnitude images, velocity images, and pathline reconstructions from phantom and in vivo scans were similar for all accelerations. For the phantom data, mean differences at peak systole for the entire vessel volume in comparison to R = 2 ranged from - 2.3 to - 5.3% (WSS) and - 2.4 to - 2.2% (velocity) for acceleration factors R = 4-20. For the in vivo data, mean differences for the entire vessel volume at peak systole in comparison to R = 10 were - 9.9, - 13.4, and - 16.9% (WSS) and - 8.4, - 10.8, and - 14.0% (velocity), for R = 20, 25, and 30, respectively. Compared to single slice 2D flow CMR acquisitions, peak systolic flow rates of the phantom showed no differences, whereas peak systolic flow rates in the carotid artery in vivo became increasingly underestimated with increasing acceleration. CONCLUSION: Acquisition of 4D flow CMR of the carotid arteries can be highly accelerated by pseudo-spiral k-space sampling and compressed sensing reconstruction, with consistent data quality facilitating velocity pathline reconstructions, as well as quantitative flow rate and WSS estimations. At an acceleration factor of R = 20 the underestimation of peak velocity and peak WSS was acceptable (< 10%) in comparison to an R = 10 accelerated 4D flow CMR reference scan. Peak flow rates were underestimated in comparison with 2D flow CMR and decreased systematically with higher acceleration factors.",Peper ES; Gottwald LM; Zhang Q; Coolen BF; van Ooij P; Nederveen AJ; Strijkers GJ,4D flow MRI; Acceleration; Cartesian; Compressed sensing; Incoherent sampling; Pseudo-spiral sampling; Total variation; Undersampling,2020,Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Video-Audio Media",,
rotating_wall,16397144,Rotation of the myocardial wall of the outflow tract is implicated in the normal positioning of the great arteries.,"Congenital heart defects frequently involve a failure of outflow tract (OFT) formation during development. We analyzed the remodeling of the OFT, using the y96-Myf5-nlacZ-16 transgene, which marks a subpopulation of myocardial cells of the pulmonary trunk. Expression analyses of reporter transcript and protein suggest that the myocardial wall of the OFT rotates before and during the formation of the great arteries. Rotational movement was confirmed by Di-I injection experiments with cultured embryos. We subsequently examined the expression of the transgene in mouse models for OFT defects. In hearts with persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA), double outlet right ventricle (DORV), or transposition of the great arteries, rotation of the myocardial wall of the OFT is arrested or fails to initiate. This is observed in Splotch (Pax3) mutants with PTA or DORV and may be a result of defects in neural crest migration, known to affect OFT septation. However, in Pitx2deltac mutant embryos, where cardiac neural crest cells are present in the heart, PTA and DORV are again associated with a rotation defect. This is also seen in Pitx2deltac mutants, which have transposition of the great arteries. Because Pitx2c is involved in left-right signaling, these results suggest that embryonic laterality affects rotation of the myocardial wall during OFT maturation. We propose that failure of normal rotation of OFT myocardium may underlie major forms of congenital heart disease.",Bajolle F; Zaffran S; Kelly RG; Hadchouel J; Bonnet D; Brown NA; Buckingham ME,,2006,Circulation research,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

On addition of dextran, which changes medium density and viscosity but not shear, vitamin D receptor assay showed no differences from controls.

rotating_wall,29695249,Aortic flow patterns and wall shear stress maps by 4D-flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance in the assessment of aortic dilatation in bicuspid aortic valve disease.,"BACKGROUND: In patients with bicuspid valve (BAV), ascending aorta (AAo) dilatation may be caused by altered flow patterns and wall shear stress (WSS). These differences may explain different aortic dilatation morphotypes. Using 4D-flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), we aimed to analyze differences in flow patterns and regional axial and circumferential WSS maps between BAV phenotypes and their correlation with ascending aorta dilatation morphotype. METHODS: One hundred and one BAV patients (aortic diameter ≤ 45 mm, no severe valvular disease) and 20 healthy subjects were studied by 4D-flow CMR. Peak velocity, flow jet angle, flow displacement, in-plane rotational flow (IRF) and systolic flow reversal ratio (SFRR) were assessed at different levels of the AAo. Peak-systolic axial and circumferential regional WSS maps were also estimated. Unadjusted and multivariable adjusted linear regression analyses were used to identify independent correlates of aortic root or ascending dilatation. Age, sex, valve morphotype, body surface area, flow derived variables and WSS components were included in the multivariable models. RESULTS: The AAo was non-dilated in 24 BAV patients and dilated in 77 (root morphotype in 11 and ascending in 66). BAV phenotype was right-left (RL-) in 78 patients and right-non-coronary (RN-) in 23. Both BAV phenotypes presented different outflow jet direction and velocity profiles that matched the location of maximum systolic axial WSS. RL-BAV velocity profiles and maximum axial WSS were homogeneously distributed right-anteriorly, however, RN-BAV showed higher variable profiles with a main proximal-posterior distribution shifting anteriorly at mid-distal AAo. Compared to controls, BAV patients presented similar WSS magnitude at proximal, mid and distal AAo (p = 0.764, 0.516 and 0.053, respectively) but lower axial and higher circumferential WSS components (p < 0.001 for both, at all aortic levels). Among BAV patients, RN-BAV presented higher IRF at all levels (p = 0.024 proximal, 0.046 mid and 0.002 distal AAo) and higher circumferential WSS at mid and distal AAo (p = 0.038 and 0.046, respectively) than RL-BAV. However, axial WSS was higher in RL-BAV compared to RN-BAV at proximal and mid AAo (p = 0.046, 0.019, respectively). Displacement and axial WSS were independently associated with the root-morphotype, and circumferential WSS and SFRR with the ascending-morphotype. CONCLUSIONS: Different BAV-phenotypes present different flow patterns with an anterior distribution in RL-BAV, whereas, RN-BAV patients present a predominant posterior outflow jet at the sinotubular junction that shifts to anterior or right anterior in mid and distal AAo. Thus, RL-BAV patients present a higher axial WSS at the aortic root while RN-BAV present a higher circumferential WSS in mid and distal AAo. These results may explain different AAo dilatation morphotypes in the BAV population.",Rodríguez-Palomares JF; Dux-Santoy L; Guala A; Kale R; Maldonado G; Teixidó-Turà G; Galian L; Huguet M; Valente F; Gutiérrez L; González-Alujas T; Johnson KM; Wieben O; García-Dorado D; Evangelista A,4D flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance (4D flow CMR); Aorta hemodynamics; Aortic dilatation; Ascending aorta; Bicuspid aortic valve; Wall shear stress,2018,Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Video-Audio Media",,

Arterial wall shear rate (ultrasound technique, profilmeter FRP III), the systo-diastolic diameter (echotracking technique) and the mean blood flow velocity and volume of the common carotid artery, the blood viscosity (rotational viscometer) and the finger arterial blood pressure (Finapress Ohmeda) were measured in 12 young volunteers (aged 25+/-2 years) and in 12 elderly hypertensives (aged 80+/-4 years) treated with short-acting calcium antagonists up to 24h before the study, both at baseline and after intravenous furosemide infusion (0.5mg/min), when the haematocrit had increased by at least two percentage points. After furosemide administration the mean arterial blood pressure decreased and blood viscosity and carotid systolic shear stress increased in both groups. However, common carotid artery diameter increased only in the young controls but not in the elderly hypertensives. These data show that an increase in carotid shear stress caused by haemoconcentration induces carotid vasodilatation only in young healthy subjects, and not in elderly hypertensives.

The predictive capacity for future myocardial infarction (MI) was compared with that of established quantitative coronary angiography (QCA)-derived predictors. Angiography-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed on 80 human coronary lesions culprit of MI within 5 years and 108 non-culprit lesions for future MI. Blood flow energy transformations were assessed in the converging flow segment of the lesion as ratios of kinetic and rotational energy values (KER and RER, respectively) at the QCA-identified minimum lumen area and proximal lesion sections. The anatomical and functional lesion severity were evaluated with QCA to derive percentage area stenosis (%AS), vessel fractional flow reserve (vFFR), and translesional vFFR (ΔvFFR). Wall shear stress profiles were investigated in terms of topological shear variation index (TSVI). KER and RER predicted MI at 5 years (AUC = 0.73, 95% CI 0.65-0.80, and AUC = 0.76, 95% CI 0.70-0.83, respectively; p < 0.0001 for both). The predictive capacity for future MI of KER and RER was significantly stronger than vFFR (p = 0.0391 and p = 0.0045, respectively). RER predictive capacity was significantly stronger than %AS and ΔvFFR (p = 0.0041 and p = 0.0059, respectively).

rotating_wall,9119807,Flow patterns in dog aortic arch under a steady flow condition simulating mid-systole.,"To elucidate the possible connection between blood flow and localized pathogenesis and the development of atherosclerosis in humans, we studied the flow patterns and the distribution of fluid axial velocity and wall shear stress in the aortic arch in detail. This was done by means of flow visualization and high-speed cinemicrographic techniques, using transparent aortic trees prepared from the dog. Under a steady flow condition at inflow Reynolds numbers of 700-1600, which simulated physiologic conditions at early- to mid-systole, slow, spiral secondary, and recirculation flows formed along the left anterior wall of the aortic arch and at the entrance of each side branch adjacent to the vessel wall opposite the flow divider, respectively. The flow in the aortic arch consisted of three major components, namely, an undisturbed parallel flow located close to the common median plane of the arched aorta and its side branches, a clockwise rotational flow formed along the left ventral wall, and the main flow to the side branches, located along the right dorsal wall of the ascending aorta. Thus, looking down the aorta from its origin, the flow in the aortic arch appeared as a single helical flow revolving in a clockwise direction. Regions of low wall shear stress were located along the leading edge of each side branch opposite the flow divider where slow recirculation flows formed, and along the left ventral wall where slow spiral secondary flows formed. If we assume that the flow patterns in the human aortic arch well resemble those observed in the dog, then it is likely that atherosclerotic lesions develop preferentially at these sites of low wall shear stress in the same manner as in human coronary and cerebral arteries.",Endo S; Sohara Y; Karino T,,1996,Heart and vessels,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",HL-29502/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,12067451,Tri-dimensional prostate cell cultures in simulated microgravity and induced changes in lipid second messengers and signal transduction.,"The high aspect rotating-wall vessel (HARV) was designed to cultivate cells in an environment that simulate microgravity. We studied previously the effects of HARV cultivation on DU-145 human prostate carcinoma cells. We determined that HARV cultivation produced a less aggressive, slower growing, less proliferative, more differentiated and less pliant cell than other cell cultivation methods. The result was a 3-dimensional (3D) growth model of prostate cancer which mimics in vivo tissue growth. This work examines the signal transduction-second messenger pathways existing temporarily in these HARV cells and correlates these features with the special properties in growth and 3D spheroid formation. We found an initial very active ceramide, a diacylglycerol increase together with increases in PI-PLC and PLA(2) a central defect in PLD (no phosphatic acid or phosphatidylethanol at any time during 15 days of HARV cultivation). There is a cross-talk between ceramide and PI3K pathways with activation of PI3K, after 6 days of HARV growth concomitant with down-regulation of ceramide. At this time, there is also an increase of cAMP (seen by increases in arachidonic acid). Taken together these results can explain the 3D organoid-like growth. We therefore developed a model for growth in HARV prostate cancer cells which involve temporal ""switches"" between second messengers, activation and cross-talk between multiplicity of signaling pathways and a central defect in PLD pathways. Essential to the late slow growth, and 3D organotypic formation are the apoptotic, anti-survival, anti-proliferation and differentiation pathways in the first days of HARV, with growth of ""new"" different types of prostate cancer cells which set-up for later ""switch"" in ceramide-PI3K to survival and proliferation.",Clejan S; O'Connor K; Rosensweig N,,2001,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",5M01 RR 5096-10/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,17676399,Vascular dynamics of a shape memory polymer foam aneurysm treatment technique.,"The vascular dynamics of a shape memory polymer foam aneurysm treatment technique are assessed through the simulated treatment of a generic basilar aneurysm using coupled fluid dynamics and heat transfer calculations. The shape memory polymer foam, which expands to fill the aneurysm when heated, is modeled at three discrete stages of the treatment procedure. To estimate an upper bound for the maximum amount of thermal damage due to foam heating, a steady velocity is specified through the basilar artery, corresponding to a minimum physiological flow velocity over a cardiac cycle. During expansion, the foam alters the flow patterns within the aneurysm by shielding the aneurysm dome from a confined jet that issues from the basilar artery. The time scales for thermal damage to the artery walls and surrounding blood flow are computed from the temperature field. The flow through the post-treatment bifurcation is comprised of two counter-rotating vortex tubes that are located beneath the aneurysm neck and extend downstream into the outlet arteries. Beneath the aneurysm neck, a marked increase in the wall shear stress is observed due to the close proximity of the counter-rotating vortex tubes to the artery wall.",Ortega J; Maitland D; Wilson T; Tsai W; Savaş O; Saloner D,,2007,Annals of biomedical engineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",R01 EB000462/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States; R01EB000462/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,8712386,Head rotation during internal jugular vein cannulation and the risk of carotid artery puncture.,"We undertook a prospective laboratory study to examine the effect of head position on the relative positions of the carotid artery and the internal jugular vein (IJV). Volunteers (n = 12) from departmental staff, 18-60 yr of age, who had never undergone cannulation of the IJV underwent imaging of their IJV and carotid artery. With the subject in a 15 degrees Trendelenburg position, two-dimensional ultrasound images of the IJV and the carotid artery were obtained on the left and right sides of the neck at 2 and 4 cm from the clavicle along the lateral border of the sternal head of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at 0 degrees, 40 degrees, and 80 degrees of head rotation from the midline. The percent overlap of the carotid artery and IJV increased significantly at 40 degrees and 80 degrees head rotation to both the right and left (P < 0.05). Data from 2 and 4 cm above the clavicle did not differ and were pooled. The percent overlap was larger on the left than the right only with 80 degrees of head rotation (P < 0.05). The increased overlap of carotid artery and IJV with head rotation > 40 degrees increases the risk of inadvertent puncture of the carotid artery associated with the common occurrence of transfixion of the IJV before it is identified during needle withdrawal. The IJV frequently collapses with needle insertion. This may result in puncture of the posterior wall of the vessel, and thus of the carotid artery when the two vessels overlap. To decrease this risk, the head should be kept in as neutral a position as possible, that is < 40 degrees rotation, during IJV cannulation.",Sulek CA; Gravenstein N; Blackshear RH; Weiss L,,1996,Anesthesia and analgesia,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,30243498,Errors in power-law estimations of inflow rates for intracranial aneurysm CFD.,"Patient-specific inflow rates are rarely available for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies of intracranial aneurysms. Instead, inflow rates are often estimated from parent artery diameters via power laws, i.e. Q ∝ D(n), reflecting adaptation of conduit arteries to demanded flow. The present study aimed to validate the accuracy of these power laws. Internal carotid artery (ICA) flow rates were measured from 25 ICA aneurysm patients via 2D phase contrast MRI. ICA diameters, derived from 3D segmentation of rotational angiograms, were used to estimate inflow rates via power laws from the aneurysm CFD literature assuming the same inlet wall shear stress (WSS) (n = 3), velocity (n = 2) or flow rate (n = 0) for all cases. To illustrate the potential impact of errors in flow rate estimates, pulsatile CFD was carried out for four cases having large errors for at least one power law. Flow rates estimated by n = 3 and n = 0 power laws had significant (p < 0.01) mean biases of -22% to +32%, respectively, but with individual errors ranging from -78% to +120%. The n = 2 power law had no significant bias, but had non-negligible individual errors of -58% to +71%. CFD showed similarly large errors for time-averaged sac WSS; however, these were reduced after normalizing by parent artery WSS. High frequency WSS fluctuations, evident in 2/4 aneurysms, were also sensitive to inflow rate errors. Care should therefore be exercised in the interpretation of aneurysm CFD studies that rely on power law estimates of inflow rates, especially if absolute (vs. normalized) WSS, or WSS instabilities, are of interest.",Chnafa C; Bouillot P; Brina O; Najafi M; Delattre BMA; Vargas MI; Pereira VM; Steinman DA,Aneurysm; Computational fluid dynamics; Flow rates; Magnetic resonance imaging; Wall shear stress,2018,Journal of biomechanics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,29107725,Proximal Stenosis Is Associated with Rupture Status in Middle Cerebral Artery Aneurysms.,"BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic factors impact cerebral aneurysm development and progression. Parent vessel architectural features, such as caliber, curvature, and angle, can affect downstream pressure and shear stress. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between proximal parent vessel stenosis and aneurysm rupture status at the middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation. METHODS: Catheter 3-dimensional rotational angiographic datasets from 69 Japanese patients with MCA aneurysms (58 unruptured/11 ruptured) were analyzed. The narrowest cross-sectional area of the M1 segment was evaluated through equidistant cross-sectional plane cuts along the M1 length. The degree of stenosis relative to M1 size (StenosisIndex) and the distance from stenosis to the aneurysm neck (StenosisAnDist) were statistically evaluated. The effects of StenosisIndex and StenosisAnDist were determined in parametric aneurysm models with/without stenosis using computational fluid dynamic and fluid-structure interaction simulations. RESULTS: MCA harboring ruptured aneurysms had significantly greater StenosisIndex (0.31 ± 0.21 vs. 0.17 ± 0.14, P = 0.01), indicative of greater narrowing, and shorter StenosisAnDist (4.26 ± 1.91 vs. 6.94 ± 4.06 mm, P = 0.02) compared with unruptured aneurysms. Multivariate analysis combining StenosisIndex and StenosisAnDist resulted in P = 0.003, area under the curve = 0.81 (80% sensitivity, 74% specificity). Computational fluid dynamic and fluid-structure interaction simulations identified a synergetic effect of high stenosis and short StenosisAnDist in inducing greater aneurysm inflow velocity and deeper jet penetration, greater dome pressure, and greater tensile stress in the aneurysm wall. CONCLUSIONS: Ruptured status in bifurcation MCA aneurysms was associated with severity of proximal M1 stenosis and its proximity to the aneurysm neck, a novel risk factor, which acts by increasing aneurysm dome wall tension, and should be considered in investigations of rupture risk stratification.",Antonov A; Kono K; Greim-Kuczewski K; Hippelheuser JE; Lauric A; Malek AM,Aneurysm formation; Aneurysm rupture; Intracranial aneurysms; Stenosis,2018,World neurosurgery,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,36758423,Effect of aging on the biaxial mechanical behavior of human descending thoracic aorta: Experiments and constitutive modeling considering collagen crosslinking.,"Collagen crosslinking, an important contributor to the stiffness of soft tissues, was found to increase with aging in the aortic wall. Here we investigated the mechanical properties of human descending thoracic aorta with aging and the role of collagen crosslinking through a combined experimental and modeling approach. A total of 32 samples from 17 donors were collected and divided into three age groups: <40, 40-60 and > 60 years. Planar biaxial tensile tests were performed to characterize the anisotropic mechanical behavior of the aortic samples. A recently developed constitutive model incorporating collagen crosslinking into the two-fiber family model (Holzapfel and Ogden, 2020) was modified to accommodate biaxial deformation of the aorta, in which the extension and rotation kinematics of bonded fibers and crosslinks were decoupled. The mechanical testing results show that the aorta stiffens with aging with a more drastic change in the longitudinal direction, which results in altered aortic anisotropy. Our results demonstrate a good fitting capability of the constitutive model considering crosslinking for the biaxial aortic mechanics of all age groups. Furthermore, constitutive modeling results suggest an increased contribution of crosslinking and strain energy density to the biaxial stress-stretch behaviors with aging and point to excessive crosslinking as a prominent contributor to aortic stiffening.",Wang R; Mattson JM; Zhang Y,Aging; Aortic stiffening; Biaxial tensile testing; Constitutive model; Crosslinking,2023,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",R01 HL098028/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,32997677,Validation of a novel cardiac motion correction algorithm for x-ray computed tomography: From phantom experiments to initial clinical experience.,"A novel cardiac motion correction algorithm has been introduced recently. Unlike other segmentation-based approaches it is fully automatic and capable of correcting motion artifacts of myocardial wall and other moving structures as well as coronary arteries of the heart. In addition, it requires raw data of only less than a single rotation for motion estimation and correction, which is a significant advantage from the perspective of x-ray exposure and workflow. The aim of this study is to explore the capability of the proposed method through phantoms and in-vivo experiments. Motion correction of coronary arteries and other heart structures including myocardial wall is the main focus of the evaluation. First, we provide a brief introduction to the concept of the motion correction algorithm. Next we address the procedure of our studies using an XCAT phantom and commercially available physical phantoms. Results of XCAT phantom demonstrate that our solution significantly improves the structural similarity of coronary arteries compared to FBP (proposed: 0.94, FBP: 0.77, p<0.001). Besides, it provides significantly lower root mean square error (proposed: 20.27, FBP: 25.33, p = 0.01) of the whole heart image. Mocomo phantom study shows that the proposed method improves the visualization of coronary arteries estimated based on motion score (1: worst, 5: best) from two experienced radiologists (proposed: 3.5, FBP: 2.1, p<0.001). The results of these phantom studies reveal that the proposed has a great potential in handling motion artifacts of other heart structures as well as coronary arteries. Finally, we provide the results of in-vivo animal and human studies. The 3D and 4D heart images show a consistently superior performance in the visualization of coronary arteries along with myocardial wall and other cardiothoracic structures. Based on these findings of our studies, we are of the opinion that our solution has a considerable potential to improve temporal resolution of cardiac CT imaging. This would open the door to innovations in structural or functional diagnosis of the heart.",Lee D; Choi J; Kim H; Cho M; Lee KY,,2020,PloS one,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over the last 4 years, 22 patients (14 men and 8 women; mean age 62.6 years) affected by 5 acute (<14 days) thrombotic occlusions of the native arteries (4 plaque thromboses in the common iliac artery and one on a dissection intimal flap of the external iliac artery), 17 subacute and chronic thromboses affecting 4 femoro-popliteal by-pass grafts, 10 stents (7 in the common iliac artery and 3 in the superficial femoral artery) and 3 stents-grafts were studied. Acute thromboses of native arteries were follow-up with colour-Doppler ultrasound (US) examination at 1 and 3 months. Subacute and chronic thrombotic occlusions were follow-up with colour-Doppler US examination at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months and yearly thereafter. RESULTS: Immediate technical success was achieved without any need for additional procedures in all acute occlusions of native arteries (4/22 cases). In the subacute and chronic occlusions, the procedure was completed with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (8/22), cutting balloon (6/22) and stenting (5/22). The complication rate was 4.8% (1 rupture of the external iliac artery repaired with a stent-graft). CONCLUSIONS: Arterial recanalisation with RT is the treatment of choice for acute thrombosis of healthy native arteries (4-7 mm); the treatment of thrombosis complicating calcified plaques or dissection intimal flaps may cause rupture of the arterial wall. In subacute and chronic occlusions of by-pass grafts, stents and stent grafts, additional procedures are necessary to achieve complete recanalisation.",Laganà D; Carrafiello G; Lumia D; Fontana F; Mangini M; Vizzari FA; Piffaretti G; Fugazzola C,,2011,La Radiologia medica,Journal Article,,

Nevertheless, concern has been expressed over the variability of predicted WSS and inconsistent associations with rupture. Previous challenges, and studies from individual groups, have focused on individual aspects of the image-based CFD pipeline. The aim of this Challenge was to quantify the total variability of the whole pipeline. METHODS: 3D rotational angiography image volumes of five middle cerebral artery aneurysms were provided to participants, who were free to choose their segmentation methods, boundary conditions, and CFD solver and settings. Participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire about their solution strategies and experience with aneurysm CFD, and provide surface distributions of WSS magnitude, from which we objectively derived a variety of hemodynamic parameters. RESULTS: A total of 28 datasets were submitted, from 26 teams with varying levels of self-assessed experience. Wide variability of segmentations, CFD model extents, and inflow rates resulted in interquartile ranges of sac average WSS up to 56%, which reduced to < 30% after normalizing by parent artery WSS. Sac-maximum WSS and low shear area were more variable, while rank-ordering of cases by low or high shear showed only modest consensus among teams. Experience was not a significant predictor of variability. CONCLUSIONS: Wide variability exists in the prediction of intracranial aneurysm WSS. While segmentation and CFD solver techniques may be difficult to standardize across groups, our findings suggest that some of the variability in image-based CFD could be reduced by establishing guidelines for model extents, inflow rates, and blood properties, and by encouraging the reporting of normalized hemodynamic parameters.",Valen-Sendstad K; Bergersen AW; Shimogonya Y; Goubergrits L; Bruening J; Pallares J; Cito S; Piskin S; Pekkan K; Geers AJ; Larrabide I; Rapaka S; Mihalef V; Fu W; Qiao A; Jain K; Roller S; Mardal KA; Kamakoti R; Spirka T; Ashton N; Revell A; Aristokleous N; Houston JG; Tsuji M; Ishida F; Menon PG; Browne LD; Broderick S; Shojima M; Koizumi S; Barbour M; Aliseda A; Morales HG; Lefèvre T; Hodis S; Al-Smadi YM; Tran JS; Marsden AL; Vaippummadhom S; Einstein GA; Brown AG; Debus K; Niizuma K; Rashad S; Sugiyama SI; Owais Khan M; Updegrove AR; Shadden SC; Cornelissen BMW; Majoie CBLM; Berg P; Saalfield S; Kono K; Steinman DA,Intracranial aneurysm; Patient-specific modelling; Rupture risk; Uncertainty quantification; Wall shear stress,2018,Cardiovascular engineering and technology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

The mechanical considerations are first discussed and equations are developed for calculating the forces affecting catheter passage in a blood vessel. These equations are applied to the problem of Judkins (transfemoral) coronary artery catheterization, using previously described anatomical information and catheter moduli values. The introduction force is calculated for each position along the vessel for both a high and low value of estimated catheter-wall friction (coefficient values of 0.04 and 0.2, respectively). Next, the problem of catheter or transducer rotation is analytically described. The advantages of spiral drive cables with high torsional rigidity and low bending stiffness are numerically shown. Finally, several methods and considerations are given for electrical connection to the transducer.

In this study, we elucidated kinetics on aggregate behaviors of two types of hiPSCs (253G1 and 201B7 lines) to clarify the influence of aggregate behaviors on cell growth by comparing aggregate morphology, size of cell aggregates, and kinetic parameters in 72 h culture under static and floating conditions, which were realized by multi-dimple plate and rotating wall vessel, respectively. In the case of 253G1 line under floating condition, aggregate number decreased and size increased drastically during culture time, t = 0-24 h due to coalescence between cell aggregates. The apparent specific growth rate decreased after t = 24 h although cell number and aggregate size gradually increased under static condition. In the case of 201B7 line under floating condition, cell and aggregate number, and aggregate size kept constant levels during t = 24-72 h due to collapse of cell aggregates by stripping of single cells from aggregate, suggesting that specific death rate increased after t = 24 h despite constant levels of apparent specific growth rate and aggregate number under static condition. Our kinetic analysis concluded that excessive increase of aggregate size due to coalescence and cell death due to collapse critically affected growth of hiPSCs in suspension culture.

We used this technique for the reconstruction of a complex soft-tissue and bony defect of rhino-oropharinx. CASE REPORT: Osteoradionecrosis of rhino-oropharingeal posterior wall with C2 necrotic body exposure occurred in a 77-year-old woman. After the failure of reconstruction with a Hadad-Bassagasteguy flap, a submental island flap with cervical spine stabilization was planned to be performed in a one-stage operation. The anterior arc of C1 and odontoid process of C2 were removed and, according to the defect size, a submental island flap was designed in an elliptical fashion. The flap was rotated 180° and tunnelized under the left parapharingeal-prevertebral space, then it was positioned in the rhino-oropharinx and fixed with reabsorbable sutures. The donor site was closed primarily. No peri- or post-operative complications occurred, neither in the recipient nor in the donor-site. At the latest follow-up, 15 months postoperatively, the patient was able to speak without any impairment and started swallowing rehabilitation with good results and an aesthetically satisfactory outcome. CONCLUSION: The submental island flap may be a reliable and versatile flap for reconstruction of head and neck defects, even though in the rhino-oropharingeal posterior wall.",Lucattelli E; Menichini G; Luparello P; Boschi A; Maggiore G; Innocenti M; Innocenti A,head and neck; microsurgery; pedicled flap; rhino-oropharinx; submental flap,2023,British journal of neurosurgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,,

The aorta model geometry is based on anatomical shape and dimensions involving aortic arch with twist and branches. Unsteady numerical simulations have been carried out to investigate the peak systolic flow in aorta through a BMHV installed at three different orientations, marked as 0°, 45°, and 90°. Velocity, vorticity, and strain fields were obtained in various cross sectional planes for all the cases to examine the spatial flow evolution starting from the sinus along the aortic arch. The valve leaflets were seen to produce small-scale stream wise contra-rotating vortices. These vortices changed their positions around the axis of aorta while advecting from one cross-sectional plane to another; thereby, clearly indicating swirl in the aortic flow. The net viscous dissipation energy loss (EL), obtained from strain field, was found to rise because of the presence of BMHV. The increase in the EL varied depending on the valve orientation as it changed from 43% for 0° to a maximum of 53% for 90° compared with no valve case. Similarly, the wall shear stress registered an increase by up to 4 Pa in the ascending aorta because the presence of BMHV; however, no significant effect of the valve orientation was noticed.",Satheesh KH; Sharma SD,,2021,ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992),Journal Article,,

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Academic tertiary referral center. PATIENT: Adults that underwent attempted reconstruction of various partial canal wall defects with the MTA flap by a single surgeon. INTERVENTION(S): Review of demographic data, defect etiology and location, operative technique, subject wound healing risk factors, and time/success of canal wall healing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Rate of complete canal wall healing/epithelialization by 8 weeks postoperation. RESULTS: Eighteen cases were reviewed. Underlying canal wall pathology included the following: cholesteatoma, penetrating trauma, malignancy, osteonecrosis, and canal-mastoid fistula. In all cases, the canal wall was completely healed and epithelialized by 8 weeks postoperation, and there were no flap-related complications. Many cases (56%) involved previous intact-canal wall mastoidectomy surgery in the past with apparent degeneration of thinned canal wall bone. In 2 cases, the MTA pedicle had been violated by previous surgery; however, a smaller vascularized flap based on remnant blood supply was successfully used in each instance. CONCLUSION: The MTA flap is useful as a thin, pliable flap that can be applied for reconstruction of various partial canal wall defects. This technique may be particularly useful in the settings of osteonecrosis and chronic infection where introduction of vascularized canal wall lining is particularly desirable. Although short-term outcomes are encouraging, the long-term outcomes of this technique are unknown.",Gluth MB; Sunde J,,2014,"Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society,",Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,38609132,THE ROLE OF DISTAL LOCKING IN INTRAMEDULLARY NAILS FOR HIP FRACTURE FIXATION: A REVIEW OF CURRENT LITERATURE.,"Traditionally, it was believed that both proximal and distal locking are essential for achieving stability during intra-medullary fixation for extra-capsular hip fractures. However, recent literature has presented varying perspectives on the necessity of distal locking. Distal locking plays a significant role in managing hip fractures with uncertainties regarding longitudinal and rotational stability. This includes cases of comminuted intertrochanteric fractures with subtrochanteric extension, reverse oblique and high oblique fractures, broad medullary canals, comminution of the lateral wall, diaphyseal fractures, and large posteromedial fragments extending below the level of the lesser trochanter. In stable pertrochanteric fractures, with the lag screw passing through the lateral cortex of the distal fragment, may not require a distal locking screw. Distal locking has been associated with potential complications, including irritation of the fascia lata, prolonged operation time, increased radiation exposure, greater blood loss, implant loosening, secondary femoral stress fractures, and damage to the femoral artery. Thus, although distal locking is of doubtful significance in stable pertrochanteric fractures it is essential in unstable fracture patterns.",Sain A; Metry A; Manzoor N; Wattage K; Elkilany A; Halasa M; Chia J; Arif S; Hussain F; Aisabokhale O; Sohail Z,,2024,Georgian medical news,Journal Article; Review,,

Results of a series of experiments in which cell concentration, viscosity and gas composition of the suspending medium and rotation speed of the exposure vessel were varied combined with observations of sonoluminescence are all consistent with a hypothesis that cells are lysed by inertial (transient) acoustic cavitation. For the proposed mechanism to operate in cell suspensions, it is necessary that bubbles be brought into contact with the cells. Rotation of the chamber recycles bubbles that are driven by radiation forces to the far wall of the chamber in a matter of milliseconds.

This rare mechanism of injury demands a high index of suspicion to enable prompt specialist management. CASE REPORT: A 22-year-old man presented to hospital after sustaining blunt neck trauma. Rapid onset of stridor necessitated an emergency tracheostomy. Computed tomography angiography demonstrated a tear of the right internal carotid artery, which was repaired surgically. DISCUSSION: Blunt carotid vessel injury, although rare, has a high mortality rate. Mechanisms of injury include hyperextension and contralateral neck rotation, a direct blow to the vessel, and laceration by adjacent bony structures. The 'gold standard' investigation for suspected blunt carotid vessel injury is catheter angiography, although this carries a small risk of stroke. Computed tomography angiography is a less invasive, alternative investigation which has almost equivalent accuracy. The extent of damage to the vessel wall will dictate treatment. In our literature review, we discuss the presentation, investigation and different treatment modalities available. CONCLUSION: This case highlights an unusual mechanism of carotid artery injury, with a delayed, potentially fatal presentation. Such injury demands a high index of suspicion, and confirmation with specific investigations.

The system consists of a single element transducer, rotated with a motor mounted on an 8F catheter tip. Cross sections obtained with ultrasound were matched with the corresponding histologic sections. The arterial specimens were histologically classified as of the muscular or elastic type. Muscular arteries interrogated with ultrasound presented with a hypoechoic media, coinciding with the smooth muscle cells. In contrast, the media of an elastic artery densely packed with elastin fibers was as echogenic as the intima and the adventitia. On the basis of the cross-sectional image, it was possible to determine the nature of the atherosclerotic plaque. The location and thickness of the lesion measured from the histologic sections correlated well with the data derived from the corresponding ultrasound images. This study indicates that characterization of the type of artery and detection of arterial wall disease are possible with use of an intravascular ultrasound imaging technique.",Gussenhoven EJ; Essed CE; Lancée CT; Mastik F; Frietman P; van Egmond FC; Reiber J; Bosch H; van Urk H; Roelandt J; et al.,,1989,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,34658417,"The effect of Dean, Reynolds and Womersley numbers on the flow in a spherical cavity on a curved round pipe. Part 2. The haemodynamics of intracranial aneurysms treated with flow-diverting stents.","The flow in a spherical cavity on a curved round pipe is a canonical flow that describes well the flow inside a sidewall aneurysm on an intracranial artery. Intracranial aneurysms are often treated with a flow-diverting stent (FDS), a low-porosity metal mesh that covers the entrance to the cavity, to reduce blood flow into the aneurysm sac and exclude it from mechanical stresses imposed by the blood flow. Successful treatment is highly dependent on the degree of reduction of flow inside the cavity, and the resulting altered fluid mechanics inside the aneurysm following treatment. Using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry, we characterize the fluid mechanics in a canonical configuration representative of an intracranial aneurysm treated with a FDS: a spherical cavity on the side of a curved round pipe covered with a metal mesh formed by an actual medical FDS. This porous mesh coverage is the focus of Part 2 of the paper, characterizing the effects of parent vessel Re, De and pulsatility, Wo, on the fluid dynamics, compared with the canonical configuration with no impediments to flow into the cavity that is described in Part 1 (Chassagne et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 915, 2021, A123). Coverage with a FDS markedly reduces the flow Re in the aneurysmal cavity, creating a viscous-dominated flow environment despite the parent vessel Re > 100. Under steady flow conditions, the topology that forms inside the cavity is shown to be a function of the parent vessel De. At low values of De, flow enters the cavity at the leading edge and remains attached to the wall before exiting at the trailing edge, a novel behaviour that was not found under any conditions of the high-Re, unimpeded cavity flow described in Part 1. Under these conditions, flow in the cavity co-rotates with the direction of the free-stream flow, similar to Stokes flow in a cavity. As De increases, the flow along the leading edge begins to separate, and the recirculation zone grows with increasing De, until, above De ≈ 180, the flow inside the cavity is fully recirculating, counter-rotating with respect to the free-stream flow. Under pulsatile flow conditions, the vortex inside the cavity progresses through the same cycle - switching from attached and co-rotating with the free-stream flow at the beginning of the cycle (low velocity and positive acceleration) to separated and counter-rotating as De reaches a critical value. The location of separation within the harmonic cycle is shown to be a function of both De and Wo. The values of aneurysmal cavity Re based on both the average velocity and the circulation inside the cavity are shown to increase with increasing values of De, while Wo is shown to have little influence on the time-averaged metrics. As De increases, the strength of the secondary flow in the parent vessel grows, due to the inertial instability in the curved pipe, and the flow rate entering the cavity increases. Thus, the effectiveness of FDS treatment to exclude the aneurysmal cavity from the haemodynamic stresses is compromised for aneurysms located on high-curvature arteries, i.e. vessels with high De, and this can be a fluid mechanics criterion to guide treatment selection.",Barbour MC; Chassagne F; Chivukula VK; Machicoane N; Kim LJ; Levitt MR; Aliseda A,biomedical flows; blood flow,2021,Journal of fluid mechanics,Journal Article,18CDA34110295/AHA/American Heart Association-American Stroke Association/United; R01 NS088072/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States; R01 NS105692/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States; R03 NS078539/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States,

Chondrocytes cultured in monolayer were released and placed without any scaffold as a single cell suspension in a rotating bioreactor for 12 weeks. Samples were analyzed with immunohistochemistry, molecular biology and electron microscopy. During serial monolayer cultures chondrocytes dedifferentiated to a ""fibroblast-like"" structure and produced predominantly collagen type I. When these dedifferentiated cells were transferred to the rotating bioreactor, the cells showed a spontaneous aggregation and formation of solid tissue during the culture time. Expression of collagen type II and other components critical for the extracellular cartilage matrix could be detected. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a fine network of randomly distributed collagen fibrils. This rotating bioreactor proves to be a useful tool for providing an environment that enables dedifferentiated chondrocytes to redifferentiate and produce a cartilage-specific extracellular matrix.",Marlovits S; Tichy B; Truppe M; Gruber D; Schlegel W,,2003,The International journal of artificial organs,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,11928994,Loss of signal transduction and inhibition of lymphocyte locomotion in a ground-based model of microgravity.,"Inflammatory adherence to, and locomotion through the interstitium is an important component of the immune response. Conditions such as microgravity and modeled microgravity (MMG) severely inhibit lymphocyte locomotion in vitro through gelled type I collagen. We used the NASA rotating wall vessel bioreactor or slow-turning lateral vessel as a prototype for MMG in ground-based experiments. Previous experiments from our laboratory revealed that when lymphocytes (human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]) were first activated with phytohemaglutinin followed by exposure to MMG, locomotory capacity was not affected. In the present study, MMG inhibits lymphocyte locomotion in a manner similar to that observed in microgravity. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) treatment of PBMCs restored lost locomotory capacity by a maximum of 87%. Augmentation of cellular calcium flux with ionomycin had no restorative effect. Treatment of lymphocytes with mitomycin C prior to exposure to MMG, followed by PMA, restored locomotion to the same extent as when nonmitomycin C-treated lymphocytes were exposed to MMG (80-87%), suggesting that deoxyribonucleic acid replication is not essential for the restoration of locomotion. Thus, direct activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with PMA was effective in restoring locomotion in MMG comparable to the normal levels seen in Ig cultures. Therefore, in MMG, lymphocyte calcium signaling pathways were functional, with defects occurring at either the level of PKC or upstream of PKC.",Sundaresan A; Risin D; Pellis NR,NASA Discipline Cell Biology; Non-NASA Center,2002,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

rotating_wall,121939,[In vivo and in vitro methods of studying platelet adhesion to the components of the vascular wall].,"Platelet adhesion to the subendothelium of the vessel wall and to its collagen component plays a key role in hemostasis, thrombosis, and the development of atherosclerosis. In order to study the mechanisms of platelet adhesion and eventually to inhibit adhesion, it has been necessary to develop methods that measure platelet adhesion quantitatively in vivo and in vitro. In this article, the methods that are used to measure platelet adhesion are reviewed critically with emphasis on their aims, advantages, and disadvantages. The methods that are used to measure platelet adhesion can be divided in five groups: (1) methods that use an aggregometer to measure platelet adhesion to collagen in the presence of EDTA; (2) methods that use binding of radiolabeled collagen, affinity chromatography, or gel filtration; (3) the morphometric method of Baumgartner that measures platelet interaction with the subendothelium of an aorta exposed to flow in an annular perfusion chamber; (4) the quantitative isotopic measurement of platelet adhesion to collagen-coated surfaces and to subendothelium with the rotating probe device of Cazenave; and (5) in vivo platelet adhesion to the subendothelium measured by the morphometric method or with platelets radiolabeled with 51Cr or 111In. With these methods is has been possible to study the factors (Ca2+; VIII: von Willebrand factor; hemodynamic factors: red cells, shear rate; components of the vessel wall) governing platelet adhesion to subendothelium and to collagen. It has also been possible to screen and study drugs inhibiting platelet adhesion, which is the first step in the formation of a thrombus at the site of vascular injury.",Cazenave JP,,1979,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,"English Abstract; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",,

rotating_wall,1606610,High-speed rotational angioplasty-induced echo contrast in vivo and in vitro optical analysis.,"High-speed rotational angioplasty is being evaluated as an alternative interventional device for the endovascular treatment of chronic coronary occlusions. It has been postulated that this type of angioplasty device may produce particulate debris or cavitations that induce myocardial ischemia. To determine the clinical presence of myocardial ischemia during rotational angioplasty, echocardiographic monitoring for wall motion abnormalities was performed in 9 patients undergoing rotational atheroablation using the Auth Rotablator for 10-sec intervals at 150,000 and 170,000 rpm. No wall motion abnormalities were detected in 5 patients evaluated with transesophageal echocardiography or in 4 patients monitored transthoracically, although AV block developed in one patient. Video intensitometry of the myocardial contrast effect for rotation times ranging from 3 to 20 sec found transient contrast enhancement of the myocardium supplied by the treated vessel. Intensity varied over time with half-time decay between 5.6 and 40 sec, indicating the likelihood of microcavitation. An in vitro model was constructed to measure the cavitation potential of the Auth Rotablator. A burr of 1.25 mm diameter rotating at 160,000 rpm achieves a velocity in excess of the 14.7 m/sec critical cavitation velocity. Testing the device in fresh human blood and distilled water produced microcavitations responsible for the enhanced echo effect, with the intensity and longevity of cavitation more pronounced in blood and proportional to the rotation time and speed. The mean size of the microcavitation bubbles in water was 90 +/- 33 (52-145) microns measured from photographs taken with a copper vapour laser emitting light pulses of 50 nsec duration as light source. The mean velocity of bubbles was found to be 0.62 +/- 0.30 ranging from 0.23 to 1.04 m/sec. It was measured via the motion of the bubbles during 5 laser pulses within 800 nsec. Clearly, microcavitations are associated with enhanced myocardial echo contrast effect.",Zotz RJ; Erbel R; Philipp A; Judt A; Wagner H; Lauterborn W; Meyer J,,1992,Catheterization and cardiovascular diagnosis,Journal Article,,

Any technological innovation and advancement in small-diameter artificial blood vessels is of great interest to the biomedical field. Here a novel technique is used to produce artificial blood vessels with a caliber of less than 6 mm and a wall thickness of less than 0.5 mm by rotational exposure, and to form a bionic inner wall with a periodically micro-nano structure inside the tube by laser double-beam interference. The polyethylene glycol diacrylate used is a widely recognized versatile biomaterial with good hydrophilicity, biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. The effect of the bionic structure on the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells was investigated, and it was demonstrated that the prepared vessels with the bionic structure could largely promote the endothelialization process of the cells inside them.

rotating_wall,32732256,How patient-specific do internal carotid artery inflow rates need to be for computational fluid dynamics of cerebral aneurysms?,"BACKGROUND: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become a popular tool for studying 'patient-specific' blood flow dynamics in cerebral aneurysms; however, rarely are the inflow boundary conditions patient-specific. We aimed to test the impact of widespread reliance on generalized inflow rates. METHODS: Internal carotid artery (ICA) flow rates were measured via 2D cine phase-contrast MRI for 24 patients scheduled for endovascular therapy of an ICA aneurysm. CFD models were constructed from 3D rotational angiography, and pulsatile inflow rates imposed as measured by MRI or estimated using an average older-adult ICA flow waveform shape scaled by a cycle-average flow rate (Q(avg)) derived from the patient's ICA cross-sectional area via an assumed inlet velocity. RESULTS: There was good overall qualitative agreement in the magnitudes and spatial distributions of time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), and spectral power index (SPI) using generalized versus patient-specific inflows. Sac-averaged quantities showed moderate to good correlations: R(2)=0.54 (TAWSS), 0.80 (OSI), and 0.68 (SPI). Using patient-specific Q(avg) to scale the generalized waveform shape resulted in near-perfect agreement for TAWSS, and reduced bias, but not scatter, for SPI. Patient-specific waveform had an impact only on OSI correlations, which improved to R(2)=0.93. CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysm CFD demonstrates the ability to stratify cases by nominal hemodynamic 'risk' factors when employing an age- and vascular-territory-specific recipe for generalized inflow rates. Q(avg) has a greater influence than waveform shape, suggesting some improvement could be achieved by including measurement of patient-specific Q(avg) into aneurysm imaging protocols. permissions.

rotating_wall,22965244,Local hemodynamics at the rupture point of cerebral aneurysms determined by computational fluid dynamics analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Cerebral aneurysms carry a high risk of rupture and so present a major threat to the patient's life. Accurate criteria for predicting aneurysm rupture are important for therapeutic decision-making, and some clinical and morphological factors may help to predict the risk for rupture of unruptured aneurysms, such as sex, size and location. Hemodynamic forces are considered to be key in the natural history of cerebral aneurysms, but the effect on aneurysm rupture is uncertain, and whether low or high wall shear stress (WSS) is the most critical in promoting rupture remains extremely controversial. This study investigated the local hemodynamic features at the aneurysm rupture point. METHODS: Computational models of 6 ruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysms with intraoperative confirmation of rupture point were constructed from 3-dimensional rotational angiography images. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed under pulsatile flows using patient-specific inlet flow conditions. Time-averaged WSS (TAWSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI) were calculated, and compared at the rupture point and at the aneurysm wall without the rupture point. We performed an additional CFD simulation of a bleb-removed model for a peculiar case in which bleb formation could be confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography. RESULTS: All rupture points were located at the body or dome of the aneurysm. The TAWSS at the rupture point was significantly lower than that at the aneurysm wall without the rupture point (1.10 vs. 4.96 Pa, p = 0.031). The OSI at the rupture point tended to be higher than at the aneurysm wall without the rupture point, although the difference was not significant (0.0148 vs. 0.0059, p = 0.156). In a bleb-removed simulation, the TAWSS at the bleb-removed area was 6.31 Pa, which was relatively higher than at the aneurysm wall (1.94 Pa). CONCLUSION: The hemodynamics of 6 ruptured cerebral aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery were examined using retrospective CFD analysis. We could confirm the rupture points in all cases. With those findings, local hemodynamics of ruptured aneurysms were quanti-tatively investigated. The rupture point is located in a low WSS region of the aneurysm wall. Bleb-removed simulation showed increased WSS of the bleb-removed area, associated with the flow impaction area. Although the number of subjects in this study was relatively small, our findings suggest that the location of the rupture point is related to a low WSS at the aneurysm wall. Further investigations will elucidate the detailed hemodynamic effects on aneurysm rupture.",Omodaka S; Sugiyama S; Inoue T; Funamoto K; Fujimura M; Shimizu H; Hayase T; Takahashi A; Tominaga T,,2012,"Cerebrovascular diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",Case Reports; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,22463037,Automatic three-dimensional registration of intravascular optical coherence tomography images.,"Intravascular optical coherence tomography (IV-OCT) is a catheter-based high-resolution imaging technique able to visualize the inner wall of the coronary arteries and implanted devices in vivo with an axial resolution below 20 μm. IV-OCT is being used in several clinical trials aiming to quantify the vessel response to stent implantation over time. However, stent analysis is currently performed manually and corresponding images taken at different time points are matched through a very labor-intensive and subjective procedure. We present an automated method for the spatial registration of IV-OCT datasets. Stent struts are segmented through consecutive images and three-dimensional models of the stents are created for both datasets to be registered. The two models are initially roughly registered through an automatic initialization procedure and an iterative closest point algorithm is subsequently applied for a more precise registration. To correct for nonuniform rotational distortions (NURDs) and other potential acquisition artifacts, the registration is consecutively refined on a local level. The algorithm was first validated by using an in vitro experimental setup based on a polyvinyl-alcohol gel tubular phantom. Subsequently, an in vivo validation was obtained by exploiting stable vessel landmarks. The mean registration error in vitro was quantified to be 0.14 mm in the longitudinal axis and 7.3-deg mean rotation error. In vivo validation resulted in 0.23 mm in the longitudinal axis and 10.1-deg rotation error. These results indicate that the proposed methodology can be used for automatic registration of in vivo IV-OCT datasets. Such a tool will be indispensable for larger studies on vessel healing pathophysiology and reaction to stent implantation. As such, it will be valuable in testing the performance of new generations of intracoronary devices and new therapeutic drugs.",Ughi GJ; Adriaenssens T; Larsson M; Dubois C; Sinnaeve PR; Coosemans M; Desmet W; D'hooge J,,2012,Journal of biomedical optics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,20004258,Bioresorbable elastomeric vascular tissue engineering scaffolds via melt spinning and electrospinning.,"Current surgical therapy for diseased vessels less than 6mm in diameter involves bypass grafting with autologous arteries or veins. Although this surgical practice is common, it has significant limitations and complications, such as occlusion, intimal hyperplasia and compliance mismatch. As a result, cardiovascular biomaterials research has been motivated to develop tissue-engineered blood vessel substitutes. In this study, vascular tissue engineering scaffolds were fabricated using two different approaches, namely melt spinning and electrospinning. Small diameter tubes were fabricated from an elastomeric bioresorbable 50:50 poly(l-lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone) copolymer having dimensions of 5mm in diameter and porosity of over 75%. Scaffolds electrospun from two different solvents, acetone and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol were compared in terms of their morphology, mechanical properties and cell viability. Overall, the mechanical properties of the prototype tubes exceeded the transverse tensile values of natural arteries of similar caliber. In addition to spinning the polymer separately into melt-spun and electrospun constructs, the approach in this study has successfully demonstrated that these two techniques can be combined to produce double-layered tubular scaffolds containing both melt-spun macrofibers (<200microm in diameter) and electrospun submicron fibers (>400nm in diameter). Since the vascular wall has a complex multilayered architecture and unique mechanical properties, there remain several significant challenges before a successful tissue-engineered artery is achieved.",Chung S; Ingle NP; Montero GA; Kim SH; King MW,,2010,Acta biomaterialia,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

This study is the first try to numerically find out what hemodynamic parameters are predisposed to the initiation and formation of thrombus after CVC insertion. And the potential relationship between hemodynamic parameters and the incidence rates of thrombosis occurrence was explored. The results revealed that the CVC insertion led to a significant increase of hydraulic resistance, wide-ranging abnormally high wall shear stress (WSS), and a great loss of flow rotation in the vein. Moreover, the clinical data showed that thrombosis mainly occurred at sections where most blood flow lost spiral rotation after the CVC insertion, but no corresponding match was observed between the occurrence of thrombosis and the flow velocity or WSS. We speculate that the destruction of the flow rotation in the central vein is a precursor to the thrombus formation around CVC, and an introduction of spiral flow with the CVC insertion may possibly help to protect the central vein from thrombosis. Further animal and clinical experiments should be carried out to test and verify this speculation.",Peng L; Qiu Y; Huang Z; Xia C; Dai C; Zheng T; Li Z,,2017,Scientific reports,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,20539183,Analysis of the mechanism of lateral impact aortic isthmus disruption in real-life motor vehicle crashes using a computer-based finite element numeric model: with simulation of prevention strategies.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite advances in the surgical therapy of aortic injury (AI) using endovascular prostheses, more than 60% of motor vehicle crash (MVC) induced AIs die at the scene. In 80 cases of MVC AI, both change in velocity on impact (Delta V) and impact energy (IE) were correlated with autopsy or surgical findings. Of the 34 AIs due to lateral impact MVCs (LMVC), 91% had an aortic isthmus laceration. Computer simulation is used to study the cause of LMVC AI. METHODS: To delineate AI mechanism, 10 real life LMVCs (8 left, 2 right) were simulated using a computer-based finite element numerical model. Each began with the initial vehicle impact with another vehicle or fixed object, followed by the vehicle's compartment structures' impact with the patient's chest wall, causing a rise in intra-aortic pressure and the resulting location and pattern of aortic wall stresses and strains. In the real LMVCs, the Delta V ranged from 27.5 to 62 kph with impact energies of from 46,051 to 313,502 joules. In both real-life and the model, the main cause of the chest wall impact was intrusion of the car's B-pillar. Dynamic simulations delineate increased stress and strains at the aortic Isthmus. In some LMVCs, the B-pillar intrusion was also seen to impact the head in the AI cases. RESULTS: In the simulations, aortic pressure rose from 100 mm Hg precrash to as high as 1,322 mm Hg. Both the maximum aortic longitudinal tensile strain and the von Mises Stress were proportional to the maximum force impacted on the chest wall. Aortic isthmus maximum stresses ranged from 1.1 Mega Pascal (MPa) to 3.2 MPa, with longitudinal tensile strains ranging from 8.2% to 48.5%. The simulation dynamics demonstrated that the proximal pressurized turgid aorta initially moves toward the LMVC impact. As a result, the ascending aorta and aortic arch (proximal ascending aorta) rotate about the fulcrum of the great vessels, so that this aortic unit, acting as the long-arm of an Archimedes lever system, exerts the maximum stress and strain at the aortic isthmus or short-arm, where the real-life aortic rupture occurs. CONCLUSION: Simulation supports the lever hypothesis that the force on the short-arm aortic isthmus is proportionally greater than at the long-arm proximal aorta. Simulation also suggests improved vehicle construction techniques, which increase the strength and resistance to deformation of the B-pillar and vehicle side structure plus a B-pillar airbag will limit the intrusion forces causing LMVC AIs and reduce the incidence of associated head injuries.",Siegel JH; Belwadi A; Smith JA; Shah C; Yang K,,2010,The Journal of trauma,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,20972626,Computational hemodynamics in cerebral aneurysms: the effects of modeled versus measured boundary conditions.,"Modeling of flow in intracranial aneurysms (IAs) requires flow information at the model boundaries. In absence of patient-specific measurements, typical or modeled boundary conditions (BCs) are often used. This study investigates the effects of modeled versus patient-specific BCs on modeled hemodynamics within IAs. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of five IAs were reconstructed from three-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA). BCs were applied using in turn patient-specific phase-contrast-MR (pc-MR) measurements, a 1D-circulation model, and a physiologically coherent method based on local WSS at inlets. The Navier-Stokes equations were solved using the Ansys®-CFX™ software. Wall shear stress (WSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), and other hemodynamic indices were computed. Differences in the values obtained with the three methods were analyzed using boxplot diagrams. Qualitative similarities were observed in the flow fields obtained with the three approaches. The quantitative comparison showed smaller discrepancies between pc-MR and 1D-model data, than those observed between pc-MR and WSS-scaled data. Discrepancies were reduced when indices were normalized to mean hemodynamic aneurysmal data. The strong similarities observed for the three BCs models suggest that vessel and aneurysm geometry have the strongest influence on aneurysmal hemodynamics. In absence of patient-specific BCs, a distributed circulation model may represent the best option when CFD is used for large cohort studies.",Marzo A; Singh P; Larrabide I; Radaelli A; Coley S; Gwilliam M; Wilkinson ID; Lawford P; Reymond P; Patel U; Frangi A; Hose DR,,2011,Annals of biomedical engineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,21310001,"Characteristics of left ventricular rotational mechanics in patients with systemic amyloidosis, systemic hypertension and normal left ventricular mass.","INTRODUCTION:   Recently, two-dimensional (2D) speckle-tracking echocardiography has enabled assessment of a particular behaviour of left ventricular (LV) motion defined as twisting/untwisting. The aim of our study is to evaluate whether in early stage of hypertension and systemic amyloidosis, subclinical alteration of LV twist and untwist is already present even if no LV hypertrophy is evidenced. METHODS:   Forty-seven patients with light chain immunoglobulin amyloidosis (AL) entered the study and were classified having cardiac amyloidosis (CA) or not (NCA) if the mean value of LV wall thickness was ≥12 mm or not. Twenty-two consecutive patients with history of arterial essential hypertension (Hyp Group) and no sign of LV hypertrophy were enrolled. A total of 26 asymptomatic healthy subjects, age-matched, were analysed as control group. All three groups of patients and healthy subjects underwent traditional and 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography evaluation. LV diameters, volumes, wall thickness, mass, ejection fraction, E/A and E/E' ratio were evaluated. RESULTS:   Twisting and untwisting rates were significantly increased in NCA and Hyp group when compared with CA and control group. Moreover, despite similar LV mass and diastolic dysfunction degree, untwisting rate peak was significantly delayed in NCA when compared with Hyp group. In patients with CA, untwisting rate delay was similar to patients with NCA. CONCLUSION:   Our results show that amyloidosis and systemic hypertension produce both LV twist and untwist rate enhancement before LV hypertrophy is developed. In patients with amyloidosis irrespectively of LV infiltration degree, a significant LV untwisting rate peak delay occurs suggesting that different aetiology of cardiac involvement could differently affect LV untwisting rate.

We present a very unusual type of aneurysm arising from the ophthalmic artery itself. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old man presented with a sudden onset of headache and was transferred to a local hospital. Computed tomography demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage around the left anterior clinoid process, but digital subtraction angiography failed to localize the source of the hemorrhage. The patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. Conventional cerebral angiography did not reveal the source of the hemorrhage, but three-dimensional rotational angiography clearly demonstrated an aneurysm arising from the ophthalmic artery trunk, apart from the internal carotid artery. INTERVENTION: The patient underwent microsurgical clipping of the aneurysm via a left pterional craniotomy. The aneurysm originated from the bifurcation of the ophthalmic artery and a perforating artery to the optic nerve. The aneurysm was successfully obliterated, and the postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSION: This report is the first to describe a case of a ruptured aneurysm arising from the ophthalmic artery trunk. We discuss the clinical significance of an aneurysm at this site, as well as the role of three-dimensional rotational angiography in determining the source of subarachnoid hemorrhage.",Yanaka K; Matsumaru Y; Kamezaki T; Nose T,,2002,Neurosurgery,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,,

Therefore, prophylactic treatment is used, which leads to unnecessary potential complications. A new modality enabling a more accurate risk assessment is needed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new-generation imaging technology that has astonishing resolution for vascular imaging. In this study, OCT was used for the evaluation of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: In vivo OCT imaging was performed for aneurysms induced in 6 rabbits and in 9 intracranial aneurysm patients. Catheters were cut short to prevent any extra length from damaging aneurysms and tissues. Images of both the parent artery and the aneurysm at multiple viewing angles were obtained using rotational OCT scanning. RESULTS: The OCT images of rabbits correlated well with histologic sections. The 3-layered architecture of the parent arteries was explicitly shown. Ruptured intracranial aneurysms manifested complete breakdown of the wall structure; however, this was not observed in any unruptured aneurysms. The OCT images of unruptured intracranial aneurysms demonstrated a trend of degradation by showing the gradual disappearance of the demarcation between the layers or incomplete apoptosis in layer structures. CONCLUSION: OCT is the most precise imaging modality because it provides detailed information regarding the aneurysm structures, thus enabling more distinct insight into the vascular construction of intracranial aneurysms.",Liu Y; Zheng Y; An Q; Song Y; Leng B,Intracranial aneurysm; Optical coherence tomography; Pathology,2019,World neurosurgery,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,27561388,The influence of the aortic valve angle on the hemodynamic features of the thoracic aorta.,"Since the first observation of a helical flow pattern in aortic blood flow, the existence of helical blood flow has been found to be associated with various pathological conditions such as bicuspid aortic valve, aortic stenosis, and aortic dilatation. However, an understanding of the development of helical blood flow and its clinical implications are still lacking. In our present study, we hypothesized that the direction and angle of aortic inflow can influence helical flow patterns and related hemodynamic features in the thoracic aorta. Therefore, we investigated the hemodynamic features in the thoracic aorta and various aortic inflow angles using patient-specific vascular phantoms that were generated using a 3D printer and time-resolved, 3D, phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI). The results show that the rotational direction and strength of helical blood flow in the thoracic aorta largely vary according to the inflow direction of the aorta, and a higher helical velocity results in higher wall shear stress distributions. In addition, right-handed rotational flow conditions with higher rotational velocities imply a larger total kinetic energy than left-handed rotational flow conditions with lower rotational velocities.",Ha H; Kim GB; Kweon J; Lee SJ; Kim YH; Kim N; Yang DH,,2016,Scientific reports,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,11284665,Factors influencing blood flow patterns in the human right coronary artery.,"Evidence suggests that atherogenesis is linked to local hemodynamic factors such as wall shear stress. We investigated the velocity and wall shear stress patterns within a human right coronary artery (RCA), an important site of atherosclerotic lesion development. Emphasis was placed on evaluating the effect of flow waveform and inlet flow velocity profile on the hemodynamics in the proximal, medial, and distal arterial regions. Using the finite-element method, velocity and wall shear stress patterns in a rigid, anatomically realistic model of a human RCA were computed. Steady flow simulations (ReD=500) were performed with three different inlet velocity profiles; pulsatile flow simulations utilized two different flow waveforms (both with Womersley parameter=1.82, mean ReD=233), as well as two of the three inlet profiles. Velocity profiles showed Dean-like secondary flow features that were remarkably sensitive to the local curvature of the RCA model. Particularly noteworthy was the ""rotation"" of these Dean-like profiles, which produced large local variations in wall shear stress along the sidewalls of the RCA model. Changes in the inlet velocity profiles did not produce significant changes in the arterial velocity and wall shear stress patterns. Pulsatile flow simulations exhibited remarkably similar cycle-average wall shear stress distributions regardless of waveform and inlet velocity profile. The oscillatory shear index was very small and was attributed to flow reversal in the waveform, rather than separation. Cumulatively, these results illustrate that geometric effects (particularly local three-dimensional curvature) dominate RCA hemodynamics, implying that studies attempting to link hemodynamics with atherogenesis should replicate the patient-specific RCA geometry.",Myers JG; Moore JA; Ojha M; Johnston KW; Ethier CR,,2001,Annals of biomedical engineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,19218736,A study of coronary artery rotational motion with dense scale-space optical flow in intravascular ultrasound.,"This paper describes a novel method for estimating tissue motion in two-dimensional intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) images of a coronary artery. It is based on the classical Lukas-Kanade (LK) algorithm for optical flow (OF). The OF vector field quantifies the amount of misalignment between two consecutive frames in a sequence of images. From the theoretical standpoint, two fundamental improvements are proposed in this paper. First, using a simplified representation of the vessel wall as a medium with randomly distributed scatterers, it was shown that the OF equation satisfies the integral brightness conservation law. Second, a scale-space embedding for the OF equation was derived under the assumption of spatial consistency in IVUS acquisitions. The spatial coherence is equivalent to a locally affine motion model. The latter effectively captures and appropriately describes a complex deformation pattern of the coronary vessel wall under the varying physiological conditions (i.e. pulsatile blood pressure). The accuracy of OF tracking was estimated on the tissue-mimicking phantoms subjected to the controlled amount of angular deviation. Moreover, the performance of the classical LK and proposed approach was compared using the simulated IVUS images with an atherosclerotic lesion. The experimental results showed robust and reliable performance of up to 5 degrees of rotation, which is within the plausible range of circumferential displacement of the coronary arteries. Subsequently, the algorithm was used to analyze vessel wall motion in 18 IVUS pullbacks from 16 patients. The in vivo experiments revealed that the motion of coronary arteries is primarily determined by the cardiac contraction.",Danilouchkine MG; Mastik F; van der Steen AF,,2009,Physics in medicine and biology,Journal Article,,

rotating_wall,10829699,Angle matching in intravascular elastography.,"Intravascular elastography is a new technique to obtain mechanical properties of the vessel wall and plaque. Mechanical information of vascular tissue is important for characterisation of different plaque components, detection of plaque vulnerability and thus choosing the proper interventional technique. The feasibility of the technique is investigated using phantoms and diseased human arteries. These studies demonstrated that elastography reveals information that is unavailable or inconclusive from the echogram alone. The technique is based on the principle that tissue strain is directly related to its mechanical properties. In intravascular elastography, the tissue is compressed using different intravascular pressures. The strain is determined using cross-correlation techniques of the radio frequency (r.f.) signals. Reliable strain estimates are only obtained when signals of corresponding tissue are correlated. Owing to catheter motion, off-centre position and non-uniform rotation of the intravascular transducer, the r.f. traces at low and at high pressure may be misaligned. Four algorithms are tested to track the corresponding ultrasound signals. Three methods (l1norm, l2norm and cross-correlation) are applied on the r.f. signal and one (l1norm) on the envelope (speckle tracking). Simulations are performed to obtain a data set with a priori knowledge of the scattering particles positions in the tissue at high and low pressure. Different positions of the catheter in the lumen, compression levels of the material and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are investigated. Finally, these findings are corroborated with a phantom experiment in a water tank. From the simulations, it can be concluded that the speckle tracking algorithm has the best performance, under all circumstances. The performance decreases with larger eccentricity of the catheter and larger compression of the material. The SNR is only of minor influence. The speckle tracking algorithm has also the best performance in the phantom experiment. The performance of the speckle tracking algorithm is better than the three r.f.-based algorithms. For intravascular elastography, implementation of this method may improve the quality of the elastogram.",Janssen CR; de Korte CL; van der Heiden MS; Wapenaar CP; van der Steen AF,,2000,Ultrasonics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,14504146,Intra-atrial ECG is not a reliable method for positioning left internal jugular vein catheters.,"BACKGROUND: ECG guidance is widely used for positioning central venous catheters (CVCs) in the superior vena cava. We noticed a higher incidence of a more perpendicular angle between the catheter tip and the vessel wall after left-sided ECG-guided catheter positioning. To investigate the value of left-sided ECG guidance, we performed this prospective study. METHODS: Of 114 patients, 53 were randomized to right and 61 to left internal jugular vein catheterization using a triple lumen catheter. Three methods to ascertain catheter tip position were sequentially applied in each patient, and the insertion depths (ID) obtained using each of the three methods were recorded: (i). ECG guidance with a Seldinger guide wire (ID-A); (ii). ECG guidance with saline 10% used as an exploring electrode (ID-B); (iii). from position ID-B, the catheter was rotated and advanced until all three lumina could be aspirated easily. The catheter was fixed in that position (ID-C). To determine final catheter tip position, intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) and a postoperative chest X-ray (CXR) were performed. RESULTS: The depth of insertion of a catheter using the three methods varied significantly in left-sided (P<0.001), but not in right-sided catheters. Forty-eight of 57 (84%) left-sided CVCs, correctly positioned according to ECG guidance, had to be advanced further to achieve free aspiration through all three lumina. By this stage, five of the catheter tips had been positioned in the upper right atrium as demonstrated by TOE. There were 13 malpositions (23%) after left-sided insertion. In nine catheter malpositions, undetected by ECG guidance, the angle between the catheter tip and the lateral wall of the superior vena cava exceeded 40 degrees on CXR. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-atrial ECG does not detect the junction between the superior vena cava and right atrium. It is not a reliable method for confirming position of left-sided CVCs. Post-procedural CXRs are recommended for left-sided, but not right-sided CVCs.",Schummer W; Herrmann S; Schummer C; Funke F; Steenbeck J; Fuchs J; Uhlig T; Reinhart K,,2003,British journal of anaesthesia,Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial,,
rotating_wall,32359198,Hemodynamics and tissue biomechanics of the thoracic aorta with a trileaflet aortic valve at different phases of valve opening.,"In a normal cardiac cycle, the trileaflet aortic valve opening is progressive, which correlates with the phasic blood flow. Therefore, we aimed to determine the impact of including an anatomically accurate reconstructed trileaflet aortic valve within a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulation model and determine the cyclical hemodynamic forces imposed on the thoracic aortic walls from aortic valve opening to closure. A pediatric patient with a normal trileaflet valve was recruited. Using the Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Data (CMR), a 3D model of the aortic valve and thoracic aorta was reconstructed. FSI simulations were employed to assess the tissue stress during a cardiac cycle as the result of changes in the valve opening. The blood flow was simulated as a mixture of blood plasma and red blood cells to account for non-Newtonian effects. The computation was validated with phase-contrast CMR. Windkessel boundary conditions were employed to ensure physiological pressures during the cardiac cycle. The leaflets' dynamic motion during the cardiac cycle was defined with an analytic grid velocity function. At the beginning of the valve opening a thin jet is developing. From mid-open towards full opening the stress level increases where the jet impinges the convex wall. At peak systole two counter-rotating Dean-like vortex cores manifest in the ascending aorta, which correlates with increased integrated mean stress levels. An accurate trileaflet aortic valve is needed for capturing of both primary and secondary flow features that impact the forces on the thoracic aorta wall. Omitting the aortic valve underestimates the biomechanical response.",Sundström E; Jonnagiri R; Gutmark-Little I; Gutmark E; Critser P; Taylor MD; Tretter JT,aorta; aortic valve; ascending aorta; fluid-structure interaction; magnetic resonance,2020,International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,16500953,A comparison of two techniques for ultrasound guided infraclavicular block.,"BACKGROUND: There is some debate about the proper site and arm position and the direction of the needle for the performance of ultrasound guided infraclavicular block. METHODS: Using ultrasound, we compared the ease and success rate of a medial or a lateral approach to the brachial plexus for performing infraclavicular block in two groups of patients (n=202). The proximity of the needle to the lung in each group was also measured with and without the arm abducted from the side. RESULTS: The medial approach was quicker to perform compared with the lateral approach (9 min vs 13 min). The medial approach also had a faster onset. On average, the three cords were more readily imaged with the medial technique (92%) compared with the lateral technique (82%) and the medial technique prevented tourniquet pain more reliably (97%) vs the lateral technique (83%). In the medial technique, the plexus was also closer to the skin (3.7 cm) compared with the lateral technique (4.5 cm). The lateral approach more frequently avoided the chest wall (49%) compared with the medial technique (35%) but resulted in more frequent vascular puncture. Both approaches provided good anesthesia at the surgical site. Abducting the arm 110 degrees and externally rotating the shoulder moves the plexus away from the thorax and closer to the surface of the skin. CONCLUSION: For infraclavicular block using ultrasound guidance the medial approach is faster and easier to perform, has lower incidence of tourniquet pain and vascular puncture, and brings the plexus closer to the skin. We recommend abducting the arm 110 degrees to minimize the risk of pneumothorax. Externally rotating the shoulder also brings the plexus closer to the skin.",Bigeleisen P; Wilson M,,2006,British journal of anaesthesia,"Comparative Study; Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,15644348,Modeling of phosphate ion transfer to the surface of osteoblasts under normal gravity and simulated microgravity conditions.,"We have modeled the transport and accumulation of phosphate ions at the remodeling site of a trabecular bone consisting of osteoclasts and osteoblasts situated adjacent to each other in straining flows. Two such flows are considered; one corresponds to shear levels representative of trabecular bone conditions at normal gravity, the other corresponds to shear level that is representative of microgravity conditions. The latter is evaluated indirectly using a simulated microgravity environment prevailing in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor (RWV) designed by NASA. By solving the hydrodynamic equations governing the particle motion in a RWV using a direct numerical simulation (DNS) technique, the shear stress values on the surface of the microcarriers are found. In our present species transfer model, osteoclasts release phosphate ions (Pi) among other ions at bone resorption sites. Some of the ions so released are absorbed by the osteoblast, some accumulate at the osteoblast surface, and the remainder are advected away. The consumption of Pi by osteoblasts is assumed to follow Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics aided by a NaPi cotransporter system. MM kinetics views the NaPi cotransporter as a system for transporting extracellular Pi into the osteoblast. Our results show, for the conditions investigated here, the net accumulation of phosphate ions at the osteoblast surface under simulated microgravity conditions is higher by as much as a factor of three. Such increased accumulation may lead to enhanced apoptosis and may help explain the increased bone loss observed under microgravity conditions.",Mukundakrishnan K; Ayyaswamy PS; Risbud M; Hu HH; Shapiro IM,NASA Discipline Cell Biotechnology; Non-NASA Center,2004,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,38457932,Patient-specific analysis of bicuspid aortic valve hemodynamics using a fully coupled fluid-structure interaction model.,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), the most common congenital heart disease, is prone to develop significant valvular dysfunction and aortic wall abnormalities such as ascending aortic aneurysm. Growing evidence has suggested that abnormal BAV hemodynamics could contribute to disease progression. In order to investigate BAV hemodynamics, we performed 3D patient-specific fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations with fully coupled blood flow dynamics and valve motion throughout the cardiac cycle. Results showed that the hemodynamics during systole can be characterized by a systolic jet and two counter-rotating recirculation vortices. At peak systole, the jet was usually eccentric, with asymmetric recirculation vortices and helical flow motion in the ascending aorta. The flow structure at peak systole was quantified using the vorticity, flow rate reversal ratio and local normalized helicity (LNH) at four locations from the aortic root to the ascending aorta. The systolic jet was evaluated with the peak velocity, normalized flow displacement, and jet angle. It was found that peak velocity and normalized flow displacement (rather than jet angle) gave a strong correlation with the vorticity and LNH in the ascending aorta, which suggests that these two metrics could be used for clinical noninvasive evaluation of abnormal blood flow patterns in BAV patients.",Qin T; Mao W; Caballero A; Kamioka N; Lerakis S; Lain S; Elefteriades J; Liang L; Sun W,Aortic disease; Ascending aorta; Bicuspid aortic valve; Fluid-structure interaction; Helical flow; Hemodynamics; Patient-specific modeling,2024,Computers in biology and medicine,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,18998497,Canal wall-down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction using the pedicled temporoparietal fascial flap: technique and preliminary results.,"OBJECTIVES: We compared the use of the pedicled temporoparietal fascial flap (TPFF) with the use of free deep temporal fascia (DTF) in soft-wall reconstruction after canal wall-down tympanoplasty. METHODS: In the TPFF group (6 ears), the pedicled TPFF that includes the superficial temporal artery and vein was raised ipsilaterally and rotated into the eradicated mastoid cavity. The tympanic membrane and external auditory canal (EAC) were reconstructed by gluing one side of the TPFF to the mucosal layer of the tympanic membrane and the reverse side of the posterior EAC skin. In the DTF group (21 ears), reconstruction was performed similarly with free DTF. The postoperative period for epithelialization of the tympanic membrane and EAC skin, postoperative complications, and reaeration in the middle ear revealed by computed tomography were reviewed in both groups. RESULTS: In the TPFF group, the mean (+/- SD) period to epithelialization was 25.5 +/- 2.8 days versus 38.4 +/- 12.0 days in the DTF group; the two groups differed statistically (Welch's t-test, p = 0.0002). No postoperative complications occurred in the TPFF group, whereas 2 patients in the DTF group underwent graft necrosis with infection. Three of the 6 patients in the TPFF group showed reaeration not only in the tympanic cavity, but also in the mastoid cavity. However, no statistical differences between the two groups were observed in terms of postoperative complications or reaeration of the mastoid cavity. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that the pedicled TPFF has positive effects on quick epithelialization. Further prospective studies are needed to reveal the superiority of the pedicled TPFF over free DTF with regard to postoperative infection and recovery of mastoid aeration.",Haginomori S; Nonaka R; Takenaka H; Ueda K,,2008,"The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",Comparative Study; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,19035734,In vivo assessment of rapid cerebrovascular morphological adaptation following acute blood flow increase.,"OBJECT: Pathological extremes in cerebrovascular remodeling may contribute to basilar artery (BA) dolichoectasia and fusiform aneurysm development. Factors regulating cerebrovascular remodeling are poorly understood. To better understand hemodynamic influences on cerebrovascular remodeling, we examined BA remodeling following common carotid artery (CCA) ligation in an animal model. METHODS: Rabbits were subjected to sham surgery (3 animals), unilateral CCA ligation (3 animals), or bilateral CCA ligation (5 animals). Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and rotational angiography were used to compute BA flow, diameter, wall shear stress (WSS), and a tortuosity index on Days 0, 1, 4, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 84. Basilar artery tissues were stained and analyzed at Day 84. Statistical analysis was performed using orthogonal contrast analysis, repeated measures analysis of variance, or mixed regression analysis of repeated measures. Statistical significance was defined as a probability value < 0.05. RESULTS: Basilar artery flow and diameter increased significantly after the procedure in both ligation groups, but only the bilateral CCA ligation group demonstrated significant differences between groups. Wall shear stress significantly increased only in animals in the bilateral CCA ligation group and returned to baseline by Day 28, with 52% of WSS correction occurring by Day 7. Only the bilateral CCA ligation group developed significant BA tortuosity, occurring within 7 days postligation. Unlike the animals in the sham and unilateral CCA ligation groups, the animals in the bilateral CCA ligation group had histological staining results showing a substantial internal elastic lamina fragmentation. CONCLUSIONS: Increased BA flow results in adaptive BA remodeling until WSS returns to physiological baseline levels. Morphological changes occur rapidly following flow alteration and do not require chronic insult to affect substantial and significant structural transformation. Additionally, it appears that there exists a flow-increase threshold that, when surpassed, results in significant tortuosity.",Hoi Y; Gao L; Tremmel M; Paluch RA; Siddiqui AH; Meng H; Mocco J,,2008,Journal of neurosurgery,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",NS043924/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States; R01 EB002873/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States; NS047242/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States; K25 NS047242-05/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States; R01 NS043924/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States; K25 NS047242/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States; EB002873/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,10876185,Successful hepatic vein reconstruction in 42 consecutive living related liver transplantations.,"BACKGROUND: In living related liver transplantation (LRLT), reconstruction of the hepatic vein (HV) by end-to-end anastomosis has been reported to be associated with acute or late outflow block. METHODS: We reviewed 42 patients who underwent LRLT from January 1996 to September 1998. RESULTS: In 7 (27%) of the 26 donor grafts obtained from left lateral segmentectomy or extended lateral segmentectomy and in 9 (56%) of the 16 grafts obtained from left lobectomy, venoplasty was required. In the remaining 26 grafts, 1-orifice left HV was obtained. In addition to the division of the duct of Arantius, the left inferior phrenic vein was divided routinely in 16 patients, which contributed to reducing the venoplasty rate from 46% to 25% (P =.1704). In all 42 patients, HV was reconstructed successfully by end-to-end anastomosis. The median ratio of the diameter of the recipient's HV to that of the graft's HV was 1.2 (range, 0.8-2.1). The grafts were fixed to the abdominal wall by using the falciform and round ligaments at a site where Doppler ultrasound showed sufficient flow in the respective vessels. Three patients developed late-onset HV obstruction and required balloon dilatation either by means of a venous route or a transhepatic route: 1 patient received a new liver on the 232nd postoperative day, 1 patient died of sepsis without outflow block, and the last patient is doing well. CONCLUSIONS: In LRLT, the division of the duct of Arantius and the left inferior phrenic vein followed by extensive clamping of the common trunk contributed to obtaining a 1-orifice HV. This facilitates anastomosis of the HVs of the grafts to the recipients' HVs, and fixation of the grafts by using the falciform and round ligaments prevents rotation of the grafts and subsequent acute outflow block.",Kubota K; Makuuchi M; Takayama T; Harihara Y; Watanabe M; Sano K; Hasegawa K; Kawarasaki H,,2000,Surgery,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,35976395,Machine learning for the automatic assessment of aortic rotational flow and wall shear stress from 4D flow cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.,"OBJECTIVE: Three-dimensional (3D) time-resolved phase-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance (4D flow CMR) allows for unparalleled quantification of blood velocity. Despite established potential in aortic diseases, the analysis is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge, hindering clinical application. The present research aimed to develop and test a fully automatic machine learning-based pipeline for aortic 4D flow CMR analysis. METHODS: Four hundred and four subjects were prospectively included. Ground-truth to train the algorithms was generated by experts. The cohort was divided into training (323 patients) and testing (81) sets and used to train and test a 3D nnU-Net for segmentation and a Deep Q-Network algorithm for landmark detection. In-plane (IRF) and through-plane (SFRR) rotational flow descriptors and axial and circumferential wall shear stress (WSS) were computed at ten planes covering the ascending aorta and arch. RESULTS: Automatic aortic segmentation resulted in a median Dice score (DS) of 0.949 and average symmetric surface distance of 0.839 (0.632-1.071) mm, comparable with the state of the art. Aortic landmarks were located with a precision comparable with experts in the sinotubular junction and first and third supra-aortic vessels (p = 0.513, 0.592 and 0.905, respectively) but with lower precision in the pulmonary bifurcation (p = 0.028), resulting in precise localisation of analysis planes. Automatic flow assessment showed excellent (ICC > 0.9) agreement with manual quantification of SFRR and good-to-excellent agreement (ICC > 0.75) in the measurement of IRF and axial and circumferential WSS. CONCLUSION: Fully automatic analysis of complex aortic flow dynamics from 4D flow CMR is feasible. Its implementation could foster the clinical use of 4D flow CMR. KEY POINTS: • 4D flow CMR allows for unparalleled aortic blood flow analysis but requires aortic segmentation and anatomical landmark identification, which are time-consuming, limiting 4D flow CMR widespread use. • A fully automatic machine learning pipeline for aortic 4D flow CMR analysis was trained with data of 323 patients and tested in 81 patients, ensuring a balanced distribution of aneurysm aetiologies. • Automatic assessment of complex flow characteristics such as rotational flow and wall shear stress showed good-to-excellent agreement with manual quantification.",Garrido-Oliver J; Aviles J; Córdova MM; Dux-Santoy L; Ruiz-Muñoz A; Teixido-Tura G; Maso Talou GD; Morales Ferez X; Jiménez G; Evangelista A; Ferreira-González I; Rodriguez-Palomares J; Camara O; Guala A,Aneurysm; Aorta; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Magnetic resonance,2022,European radiology,Journal Article,"PI14/01062, PI17/00381 and PI20/01727/Instituto de Salud Carlos III/; RTC2019-007280-1/Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades/; RTI2018-101193-B-I00/Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades/; IJC2018-037349-I/Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades/; PRE2018-084062/Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad/; SEC/FEC-INV-CLI 20/015 and SEC/FEC-INV-CLI 21/030/Sociedad Española de; 2020-FI-B-00690/Agència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca/; LCF/BQ/PR22/11920008/""la Caixa"" Foundation/",

Although some studies have reported that 3D printing of large-sized blood vessels in the human body has been achieved, there are still some problems to be solved urgently, such as the unfulfilled microvascular simulation and inferior biocompatibility and mechanical strength of scaffold materials. In this paper, the hybrid bioink prepared with gelatin, sodium alginate and carbon nanotubes were manufactured into cylindrical scaffolds through the collaboration between the vertical directional extrusion of printing nozzle and axial rotation of stepper motor module. Mouse epidermal fibroblasts were inoculated into the inner and outer walls of hollow tubular scaffolds to fabricate engineered blood vessels. The internal diameters of the bionic circular tubes printed in batches were 3 mm with an average wall thickness of 0.5 mm and a length of 7-10 cm. Results demonstrated that the proper doping of carbon nanotubes could effectively increase the mechanical properties of the composite scaffolds.

rotating_wall,15560681,Morphological analysis of in vivo velocity field in the alteration of the vasomotor tone.,"Vessel wall remodeling is involved in atherogenesis and in several important vascular diseases affecting mainly aged and prosthetic implanted patients. This adaptive response to pathological states in arterial hemodynamics strongly suggests that flow-derived stresses act as mechanical stimuli to the release of endothelium-derived vasoactive factors, leading to vascular alterations. As the correlation of intimal hyperplasia (IH) with blood flow alterations in arteries has been shown to be significant, and as it is well-known that clinical procedures carry a substantial risk of development of vascular disease, the relevance of local hemodynamics must be investigated to describe changes in compliance matching in prosthetic applications. The aim of our research is to investigate the use of principal components analysis, together with varimax rotation, in the individuation process of morphological characteristics of real time ultrasound in in vivo recordings of blood flow velocities, as provided by two different carotid perivascular manipulations. This would be of use in the clinical assessment of atherogenesis, hypertension, prosthetic replacement or more in general in all applications in which vascular tone may be impaired. Data recordings refer to previous animal experiments where the Moncada model was investigated by means of an ultrasound profilometer.

Tropical cyclones, pools of water, and storms all exhibit rotational movement. The current investigation aims to analyse the micro polar fluid flow between two infinite vertical discs enclosing Hall impact, varying thermal conductivity, heat flux as well as anomalous heat generation. The implication of a chemical change combined with chemical potential improves mass propagation. Suitable similarity conversions are used to convert the defined problems into conventional differential equations (ODEs). Furthermore, by introducing new variables the ODEs are transformed into nonlinear coupled ODEs and then solved numerically by the RK 4(th) order along with the shooting technique. The velocity profiles decrease as suction parameter increases. The temperature field exhibits a rising behaviour for the increasing values of thermophoresis, Brownian and radiations parameters while the concentration field shows a decreasing behaviour. Shear stress at the upper wall increases when the rotation variable and suction variable are augmented. Heat transmission escalations at the bottom wall when Prandtl number and radiation factor are enhanced.

They are connected to a flexible hose placed inside a flexible polyvinyl sheath whose outer diameter is 6.8 mm and length is 50 cm. A cylindrical latex balloon is mounted on this sheath which is water inflated to minimum pressure, ensuring a good ultrasonic coupling between the transducers and the oesophageal wall. Connection between the probe and the apparatus is made by three coaxial cables. Three isolator-transformers are built into the connector cable to ensure a safe electrical circuit. After having bled the probe of any air, the balloon is deflated. The probe is gently introduced into the oesophagus by nasal or oral route until the transducers are situated between the 5th and 6th vertebra. The balloon is then inflated to minimum pressure with 10 ml of distilled water contained in a syringe. To find the aorta, the velocimeter is first used like a Doppler stethoscope. The probe is rotated into a position corresponding to the maximum level of Doppler signal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Cathignol D; Lavandier B; Muchada R,,1985,Annales francaises d'anesthesie et de reanimation,English Abstract; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,1761717,Orthostatic function during a stand test before and after head-up or head-down bedrest.,"Astronauts may exhibit orthostatic dysfunction upon returning to 1 g after space flight. Understanding cardiovascular changes at 0 G will provide insights into the mechanisms of the loss of orthostatic tolerance, whether due to space flight or bedrest. Bedrest is one model used to produce cardiovascular changes that are associated with space flight. In the current study, young male adults were placed at -5 degrees, +10, +20, or +42 degrees bedrest (0, 1/6, 1/3, and 2/3g, respectively) for 6 hours on 4 different days. This was preceded and followed by a stand test: 5 minutes in the supine position, and then 5 minutes in the standing position, with the feet 9 inches apart and 6 inches from the wall. Cardiovascular values were measured at 1-minute intervals. Systolic and diastolic pressures were measured using an automated blood pressure device; mean arterial pressure (MAP; mm Hg) was calculated. Heart rate (bpm) and cardiac parameters were measured with a thoracic impedance device. Minute 3, 4, and 5 values were used to determine whether there were time or angle effects. Of six subjects, one reported nausea upon 3 minutes of standing after 6 hours of bedrest at -5 degrees. The same subject was lightheaded in the first minute of standing after 6 hours of bedrest at +10 degrees. Mean heart rate pre-bedrest in the supine position was 63 and increased by 24 bpm on standing. Heart rate post-bedrest in the supine position was 65 and increased by 35 bpm on standing; standing heart rate increased 11 bpm after -5 degrees bedrest. The increases after +10 degrees, +20 degrees, and +42 degrees tilts were 4, 3, and 4 bpm, respectively. Changes in the mean arterial blood pressure were minimal. Results from the stand test pre- and post- 6 hours of bedrest at -5 degrees but not at +10 degrees, +20 degrees, or +42 degrees are similar to those after space flight.",Lathers CM; Diamandis PH; Riddle JM; Mukai C; Elton KF; Bungo MW; Charles JB,NASA Center JSC; NASA Discipline Cardiopulmonary; NASA Discipline Number 14-10; NASA Program Space Physiology and Countermeasures,1991,Journal of clinical pharmacology,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,24719392,Strategy for analysis of flow diverting devices based on multi-modality image-based modeling.,"Quantification and characterization of the hemodynamic environment created after flow diversion treatment of cerebral aneurysms is important to understand the effects of flow diverters and their interactions with the biology of the aneurysm wall and the thrombosis process that takes place subsequently. This paper describes the construction of multi-modality image-based subject-specific CFD models of experimentally created aneurysms in rabbits and subsequently treated with flow diverters. Briefly, anatomical models were constructed from 3D rotational angiography images, flow conditions were derived from Doppler ultrasound measurements, stent models were created and virtually deployed, and the results were compared with in vivo digital subtraction angiography and Doppler ultrasound images. The models were capable of reproducing in vivo observations, including velocity waveforms measured in the parent artery, peak velocity values measured in the aneurysm, and flow structures observed with digital subtraction angiography before and after deployment of flow diverters. The results indicate that regions of aneurysm occlusion after flow diversion coincide with slow and smooth flow patterns, whereas regions still permeable at the time of animal sacrifice were observed in parts of the aneurysm exposed to larger flow activity, that is, higher velocities, more swirling, and more complex flow structures.",Cebral JR; Mut F; Raschi M; Ding YH; Kadirvel R; Kallmes D,CFD; cerebral aneurysm; flow diversion; hemodynamics; rabbit model,2014,International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",R01 NS076491/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States; NS076491/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States,

The IMAP flaps were used in two patients who had unhealed, localised ulcers of the chest wall with exposure of the ribs after radical mastectomy. The lesion was excised widely, and the flap, based on a perforator vessel in the second or third intercostal space of the opposite chest wall, was raised. The flap was rotated from 90° to 180° along the vascular axis to the chest wall defect. The donor site was closed primarily. Both flaps showed stable postoperative circulation and survived completely. Defects of the chest wall could be covered with healthy, well-vascularised tissue on one perforator without deep infection. The IMAP flap is a reliable and less invasive option to be considered for medial, localised, reconstruction of the chest wall.",Takeuchi M; Sakurai H,,2013,Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,32447300,Increased focal internal carotid artery angulation in patients with posterior communicating artery aneurysms.,"BACKGROUND: Aneurysms at the posterior communicating artery (PCOM) origin represent the most common location on the internal carotid artery (ICA), and are associated with greater recurrence following endovascular treatment. We evaluate the association between ICA angulation in three-dimensional (3D) space and PCOM aneurysmal development, using high-resolution 3D rotational angiography (3DRA) studies. METHODS: 3DRA datasets were evaluated in 70 patients with PCOM aneurysms, 31 non-aneurysmal contralateral, and 86 healthy controls (187 total). The local angle formed by upstream and downstream ICA segments at the PCOM origin, α(ICA@PCOM), was measured using 3DRA multiplanar reconstruction. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed on parametric and patient-based models. RESULTS: α(ICA@PCOM) was significantly larger in aneurysm-bearing ICA segments (68.14±11.91°) compared with non-aneurysmal contralateral (57.17±10.76°, p<0.001) and healthy controls (48.13±13.68°, p<0.001). A discriminant threshold α(ICA@PCOM) value of 61° (87% specificity, 80% sensitivity) was established (area under the curve (AUC)=0.88). Ruptured PCOM aneurysms had a significantly larger α(ICA@PCOM) compared to unruptured (72.65±15.16° vs 66.35±9.94°, p=0.04). In parametric and patient-based CFD analysis, a large α(ICA@PCOM) induces high focal pressure at the PCOM origin, relatively low wall shear stress (WSS), and high proximal WSS spatial gradients (WSSG). CONCLUSION: ICA angulation at PCOM origin is significantly higher in vessels harboring PCOM aneurysms compared with contralateral and healthy ICAs. This sharper bend in the ICA leads to high focal pressure at the aneurysm neck, low focal WSS and high proximal WSSG. These findings underline the importance of morphological ICA variations and the likelihood of PCOM aneurysm, an association which can inform clinical decisions and may serve in predictive analytics. permissions.

rotating_wall,30249257,Relation of arterial stiffness to left ventricular structure and function in healthy women.,"BACKGROUND: Interactions between the left ventricular (LV) and the arterial system, (ventricular-arterial coupling) are key determinants of cardiovascular function. However, most of studies covered multiple cardiovascular risk factors, which also contributed to the morphological and functional changes of LV. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between arterial stiffness and LV structure and function in healthy women with a low burden of risk factors. METHODS: Healthy women from the Twins UK cohort (n = 147, mean age was 54.07 ± 11.90 years) were studied. Arterial stiffness was evaluated by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV). LV structure and function were assessed by two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. RESULTS: cf-PWV was significantly associated with most measures of LV geometry and function, including relative wall thickness (RWT), E/e' ratio, global circumferential and radial strain, apical rotation and LV twist (each p <  0.05), but bore no relation to global longitudinal strain. After adjustment for age, body mass index, blood pressure and heart rate, cf-PWV was significantly correlated with RWT, global circumferential strain, apical rotation and LV twist (β = 0.011, - 0.484, 1.167 and 1.089, respectively, each p ≤  0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In healthy women with a low burden of risk factors, elevated arterial stiffness was intimately interwoven with increased LV twisting even before LV dysfunction becomes clinically evident.",Zhang J; Chowienczyk PJ; Spector TD; Jiang B,Arterial stiffness; Left ventricular hypertrophy; Left ventricular twist; Speckle tracking echocardiography,2018,Cardiovascular ultrasound,Journal Article,"PG/06/032/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom; FP-7/2007-2013/Welcome Trust, European Community's Seventh Framework Programmes/",
rotating_wall,1466321,Classification of morphologic effects of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty assessed by intravascular ultrasound.,"The aim of this study was the assessment and classification of the morphologic effects of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA) by intravascular ultrasound (IU). Fifty-eight patients were examined immediately after PTCA with a 4.8Fr, 20 MHz rotational tip IU system. In 10 patients (17%), IU images could not be analyzed due to failure of the imaging system or poor image quality. In 48 patients (83%; 40 men and 8 women, aged 55 +/- 9 years), IU images of 48 PTCA segments, as well as 41 distal and 44 proximal sites, were analyzed. The left anterior descending artery was studied in 30 patients, the right coronary artery in 17 and the left main coronary artery in 1. Calcium was present in 32 of 48 PTCA segments (67%). Plaque morphology was concentric in 18 patients (38%) and eccentric in 30 (62%). Seven distinct morphologic patterns were observed. In concentric plaques, plaque compression without significant wall alterations (type 1) was found in 2 patients (4%), superficial tears within the plaque (type 2) in 1 (2%) and deep tears (type 3) in 8 (17%). Deep tearing associated with submedial or subintimal dissection (type 4) was found in 2 patients (4%). Dissection between plaque and vessel wall without noticeable intimal tearing (type 5) was the most common morphology (n = 15; 31%) and occurred in concentric and eccentric plaques. In eccentric plaques, no significant tearing of the plaque (type 6) was found in 6 patients (13%), and tearing of the plaque close to its base with dissection (type 7) in 14 (29%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Gerber TC; Erbel R; Görge G; Ge J; Rupprecht HJ; Meyer J,,1992,The American journal of cardiology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,23540271,Colocalization of thin-walled dome regions with low hemodynamic wall shear stress in unruptured cerebral aneurysms.,"OBJECT: Wall shear stress (WSS) plays a role in regulating endothelial function and has been suspected in cerebral aneurysm rupture. The aim of this study was to evaluate the spatial relationship between localized thinning of the aneurysm dome and estimated hemodynamic factors, hypothesizing that a low WSS would correlate with aneurysm wall degeneration. METHODS: Steady-state computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed on 16 aneurysms in 14 patients based on rotational angiographic volumes to derive maps of WSS, its spatial gradient (WSSG), and pressure. Local dome thickness was estimated categorically based on tissue translucency from high-resolution intraoperative microscopy findings. Each computational model was oriented to match the corresponding intraoperative view and numerically sampled in thin and normal adjacent dome regions, with controls at the neck and parent vessel. The pressure differential was computed as the difference between aneurysm dome points and the mean neck pressure. Pulsatile time-dependent confirmatory analysis was carried out in 7 patients. RESULTS: Matched-pair analysis revealed significantly lower levels of WSS (0.381 Pa vs 0.816 Pa; p<0.0001) in thin-walled dome areas than in adjacent baseline thickness regions. Similarly, log WSSG and log WSS×WSSG were both lower in thin regions (both p<0.0001); multivariate logistic regression analysis identified lower WSS and higher pressure differential as independent correlates of lower wall thickness with an area under the curve of 0.80. This relationship was observed in both steady-state and time-dependent pulsatile analyses.

rotating_wall,23456453,The preparation and performance of a new polyurethane vascular prosthesis.,"We investigated the performance of small-caliber polyurethane (PU) small-diameter vascular prosthesis generated using the electrospinning technique. PU was electrospun into small-diameter, small-caliber tubular scaffolds for potential application as vascular grafts. We investigated the effects of electrospinning conditions (solution concentration, mandrel rotation speed) on the microstructure and porosity of the scaffolds for the purpose of preparing scaffolds with optimum microstructures and properties. We evaluated the mechanical properties of the scaffolds by tensile tests and the cytotoxicity of the PU small-diameter, small-caliber PU synthetic vascular graft by the MTT assay. The adhesion of endothelial cells to the PU scaffold was characterized by Hoechst staining and fluorescence microscopy, and we measured endothelial cell proliferation on the PU scaffold by the CCK-8 assay. We analyzed the prosthesis microstructure and endothelial cell morphology using scanning electron microscopy. With increasing PU concentration in the electrospinning solution, the fiber diameter of the vascular graft increased and the porosity decreased. In addition, with increasing electrospinning time, the wall thickness increased and the porosity decreased. We found that regular fiber orientation can be obtained by adjusting the rotation speed of the mandrel. Cell proliferation was not inhibited as the small-caliber PU synthetic vascular grafts showed little cytotoxicity. The endothelial cells had faster adherence to the PU scaffolds than to the PTFE surface during the initial contact. After prolonged cell culture, significantly higher endothelial cell proliferation rate was observed in the PU scaffold groups than the PTFE group. We obtained small-caliber PU vascular grafts with optimal fiber arrangement, excellent mechanical properties, and optimal biocompatibility by optimizing the electrospinning conditions. This study provides in vitro biocompatibility data that is helpful for the clinical application of the PU small-diameter, small-caliber PU vascular grafts.",He W; Hu Z; Xu A; Liu R; Yin H; Wang J; Wang S,,2013,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

We investigated the application of microg to human umbilical cord blood stem cells (CBSC) in the induction of vascular endothelial phenotype expression and cellular proliferation. CD34+ mononuclear cells were isolated from waste human umbilical cord blood samples and cultured in simulated microg for 14 days. The cells were seeded in rotary wall vessels (RWV) with or without microcarrier beads (MCB) and vascular endothelial growth factor was added during culture. Controls consisted of culture in 1 G. The cell cultures in RWV were examined by inverted microscopy. Cell counts, endothelial cell and leukocyte markers performed by flow cytometry and FACS scan were assayed at days 1, 4, 7 and at the termination of the experiments. Culture in RWV revealed significantly increased cellular proliferation with three-dimensional (3D) tissue-like aggregates. At day 4, CD34+ cells cultured in RWV bioreactor without MCB developed vascular tubular assemblies and exhibited endothelial phenotypic markers. These data suggest that CD34+ human umbilical cord blood progenitors are capable of trans-differentiation into vascular endothelial cell phenotype and assemble into 3D tissue structures. Culture of CBSC in simulated microg may be potentially beneficial in the fields of stem cell biology and somatic cell therapy.",Chiu B; Wan JZ; Abley D; Akabutu J,,2005,Acta astronautica,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,30737298,In Vivo Translation of the CIRPI System: Revealing Molecular Pathology of Rabbit Aortic Atherosclerotic Plaques.,"Thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) are the unstable lesions in coronary artery disease that are prone to rupture, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, their small size and complex morphologic and biologic features make early detection and risk assessment difficult. We tested our newly developed catheter-based Circumferential-Intravascular-Radioluminescence-Photoacoustic-Imaging (CIRPI) system in vivo to enable detection and characterization of vulnerable plaque structure and biology in rabbit abdominal aorta. Methods: The CIRPI system includes a novel optical probe combining circumferential radioluminescence imaging and photoacoustic tomography (PAT). The probe's CaF(2):Eu-based scintillating imaging window captures radioluminescence images (360° view) of plaques by detecting β-particles during (18)F-FDG decay. A tunable laser-based PAT characterizes tissue constituents of plaque at 7 different wavelengths-540 and 560 nm (calcification), 920 nm (cholesteryl ester), 1040 nm (phospholipids), 1180 nm (elastin/collagen), 1210 nm (cholesterol), and 1235 nm (triglyceride). A single B-scan is concatenated from 330 A-lines captured during a 360° rotation. The abdominal aorta was imaged in vivo in both atherosclerotic rabbits (Watanabe Heritable Hyper Lipidemic [WHHL], 13-mo-old male, n = 5) and controls (New Zealand White, n = 2). Rabbits were fasted for 6 h before 5.55 × 10(7) Bq (1.5 mCi) of (18)F-FDG were injected 1 h before the imaging procedure. Rabbits were anesthetized, and the right or left common carotid artery was surgically exposed. An 8 French catheter sheath was inserted into the common carotid artery, and a 0.035-cm (0.014-in) guidewire was advanced to the iliac artery, guided by x-ray fluoroscopy. A bare metal stent was implanted in the dorsal abdominal aorta as a landmark, followed by the 7 French imaging catheters that were advanced up to the proximal stent edge. Our CIRPI and clinical optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed using pullback and nonocclusive flushing techniques. After imaging with the CIRPI system, the descending aorta was flushed with contrast agent, and OCT images were obtained with a pullback speed of 20 mm/s, providing images at 100 frames/s. Results were verified with histochemical analysis. Results: Our CIRPI system successfully detected the locations and characterized both stable and vulnerable aortic plaques in vivo among all WHHL rabbits. Calcification was detected from the stable plaque (540 and 560 nm), whereas TCFA exhibited phospholipids/cholesterol (1040 nm, 1210 nm). These findings were further verified with the clinical OCT system showing an area of low attenuation filled with lipids within TCFA. PAT images illustrated broken elastic fiber/collagen that could be verified with the histochemical analysis. All WHHL rabbits exhibited sparse to severe macrophages. Only 4 rabbits showed both moderate-to-severe level of calcifications and cholesterol clefts. However, all rabbits exhibited broken elastic fibers and collagen deposition. Control rabbits showed normal wall thickness with no presence of plaque tissue compositions. These findings were verified with OCT and histochemical analysis. Conclusion: Our novel multimodality hybrid system has been successfully translated to in vivo evaluation of atherosclerotic plaque structure and biology in a preclinical rabbit model. This system proposed a paradigm shift that unites molecular and pathologic imaging technologies. Therefore, the system may enhance the clinical evaluation of TCFA, as well as expand our understanding of coronary artery disease.",Zaman RT; Yousefi S; Chibana H; Ikeno F; Long SR; Gambhir SS; Chin FT; McConnell MV; Xing L; Yeung A,TCFA; cardiology (basic/technical); instrumentation; molecular imaging; multi-mode catheter based imaging system; optical; optical imaging; photoacoustic imaging; radioluminescence imaging,2019,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",K99 HL127180/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; R00 HL127180/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,23275070,Cerebral arterial fenestrations: a common phenomenon in unexplained subarachnoid haemorrhage.,"BACKGROUND: Fenestrations of intracranial arteries are variants resulting from incomplete fusion of vessels during development with unknown clinical significance. They are best visualised with 3D rotational angiography (3DRA). OBJECTIVE: In a prospective consecutive series of patients with suspected aneurysms, 3DRA was performed to identify not only the potential bleeding source but also to assess the frequency and location of any fenestrations of intracranial arteries. METHODS: In 287 consecutive patients with possible intracranial aneurysms (accidental discovery or previous history of SAH), 3DRAs were prospectively performed, and the location of subarachnoid haemorrhage was assessed by CT. RESULTS: Of 174 patients presenting with SAH, 153 had saccular aneurysms, and in 21 cases (12.1 %), no source of bleeding was found. In 20 of these 21 patients with ""unexplained SAH"" (95.2 %) an arterial fenestration was detected in the neighbourhood of the clot. The incidence of fenestration in the 153 aneurysmal SAH patients was 22.9 %, and it was 23.3 % in 266 patients with intracranial aneurysms (113 accidental and 153 ruptured). CONCLUSIONS: Arterial fenestration was detected in 22.9 % of ruptured cerebral aneurysms, in contrast with 95.2 % in patients with unexplained SAH, the difference being statisctically significant (p < 0.01). Fenestration is a developmental defect, a structural wall weakness possibly making the vessel prone to rupture. Its incidence of nearly 100 % may suggest a connection with idiopathic SAH. The presented data indicate that arterial fenestrations are generally overlooked, and they can be considered as one of the candidates for the source of idiopathic SAH.",Hudák I; Lenzsér G; Lunenkova V; Dóczi T,,2013,Acta neurochirurgica,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,30969431,Analysis of procedural data of pulmonary vein isolation for atrial fibrillation with the second-generation laser balloon.,"BACKGROUND: The procedural data of pulmonary vein (PV) isolation (PVI) for patients with atrial fibrillation using the second-generation laser balloon (LB2), which became available recently, remains unclear and were evaluated. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients (116 PVs) underwent PVI using LB2 (LB2 group) and were matched to 30 patients (116 PVs) treated with the first-generation laser balloon (LB1 group). The left atrial isolated surface area (ISA) (ratio of the total isolated antral surface area excluding PV to the total isolated antral surface area including the posterior wall) was also measured after LB2 PVI. RESULTS: PVI was achieved in 103/116 (89%) PVs and 108/116 (93%) PVs in the LB2 and LB1 groups, respectively, after the initial circular ablation (P = 0.360) and in 115/116 (99%) PVs and 116/116 (100%) PVs in the LB2 and LB1 groups, respectively, at the end of the procedure (P = 1.000). PV occlusion grade, categorized by the degree of PV occlusion, was significantly better in the LB2 group than in the LB1 group (P < 0.001). Zero rotational maneuver was applicable in 23/116 (20%) PVs and 8/116 (7%) in the LB2 and LB1 groups, respectively (P = 0.007). There was no significant difference in the procedural time, fluoroscopic time, or complications. The mean ISA after LB2 PVI was 53 ± 14%. The application number was the only independent predictor of successful PVI after initial circular LB2 ablation (adjusted odds ratio 0.860; 95% confidence interval 0.764-0.968; P = 0.013).

rotating_wall,2299747,"Endoscopic intravascular surgery removes intraluminal flaps, dissections, and thrombus.","Over the last 3 years angioscopic techniques have been used to guide intraluminal instrumentation in 73 patients undergoing thrombectomy, nine patients with vascular trauma, and 32 patients during laser angioplasty and balloon dilation. After balloon-catheter thromboembolectomy residual, occlusive thrombi tightly adherent to the arterial wall were removed with flexible biopsy forceps in 13 of 73 (18%) patients; underlying intimal flaps were removed in another four. In nine patients traumatic intimal defects caused by iatrogenic cannulation injuries (n = 5) or external trauma (n = 4) were managed by thrombectomy followed by complete or partial intravascular removal of the intimal flap (n = 6) or dissection plane (n = 3) with long flexible forceps and rotating brushes. Traumatic intimal defects observed in two additional patients were judged to be too severe for endoscopic manipulation and required immediate bypass grafting. Inspection after angioplasty in 32 patients revealed wall charring and obvious thermal damage after laser procedures in 28 (87%) and plaque cracking, intimal flaps, and fragmentation in 26 (81%). These defects were underestimated on intraoperative angiography. Large flaps and thrombus were removed endoscopically in three. We conclude that angioscopic study reveals the extent of intimal injury and gives insights into mechanisms of instrumentation. Adherent thrombus after embolectomy by balloon catheter and intimal flaps caused by trauma or angioplasty are common and, if severe, can be successfully treated by endoscopic intravascular manipulation in selected patients.",White GH; White RA; Kopchok GE; Colman PD; Wilson SE,,1990,Journal of vascular surgery,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,6627609,Carotid bifurcation atherosclerosis. Quantitative correlation of plaque localization with flow velocity profiles and wall shear stress.,"The distribution of nonstenosing, asymptomatic intimal plaques in 12 adult human carotid bifurcations obtained at autopsy was compared with the distribution of flow streamline patterns, flow velocity profiles, and shear stresses in corresponding scale models. The postmortem specimens were fixed while distended to restore normal in vivo length, diameter, and configuration. Angiograms were used to measure branch angles and diameters, and transverse histological sections were studied at five standard sampling levels. Intimal thickness was determined at 15 degrees intervals around the circumference of the vessel sections from contour tracings of images projected onto a digitizing plate. In the models, laser-Doppler anemometry was used to determine flow velocity profiles and shear stresses at levels corresponding to the standard specimen sampling sites under conditions of steady flow at Reynolds numbers of 400, 800, and 1200, and flow patterns were visualized by hydrogen bubble and dye-washout techniques. Intimal thickening was greatest and consistently eccentric in the carotid sinus. With the center of the flow divider as the 0 degree index point, mid-sinus sections showed minimum intimal thickness (0.05 +/- 0.02 mm) within 15 degrees of the index point, while maximum thickness (0.9 +/- 0.1 mm) occurred at 161 +/- 16 degrees, i.e., on the outer wall opposite the flow divider. Where the intima was thinnest, along the inner wall, flow streamlines in the model remain axially aligned and unidirectional, with velocity maxima shifted toward the flow divider apex. Wall shear stress along the inner wall ranged from 31 to 600 dynes/cm2 depending on the Reynolds number. Where the intima was thickest, along the outer wall opposite the flow divider apex, the pattern of flow was complex and included a region of separation and reversal of axial flow as well as the development of counter-rotating helical trajectories. Wall shear stress along the outer wall ranged from 0 to -6 dynes/cm2. Intimal thickening at the common carotid and distal internal carotid levels of section was minimal and was distributed uniformly about the circumference. We conclude that in the human carotid bifurcation, regions of moderate to high shear stress, where flow remains unidirectional and axially aligned, are relatively spared of intimal thickening. Intimal thickening and atherosclerosis develop largely in regions of relatively low wall shear stress, flow separation, and departure from axially aligned, unidirectional flow. Similar quantitative evaluations of other atherosclerosis-prone locations and corresponding flow profile studies in geometrically accurate models may reveal which of these hemodynamic conditions are most consistently associated with the development of intimal disease.",Zarins CK; Giddens DP; Bharadvaj BK; Sottiurai VS; Mabon RF; Glagov S,,1983,Circulation research,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",15062-11/PHS HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,12325155,RWPV bioreactor mass transport: earth-based and in microgravity.,"Mass transport and mixing of perfused scalar quantities in the NASA Rotating Wall Perfused Vessel bioreactor are studied using numerical models of the flow field and scalar concentration field. Operating conditions typical of both microgravity and ground-based cell cultures are studied to determine the expected vessel performance for both flight and ground-based control experiments. Results are presented for the transport of oxygen with cell densities and consumption rates typical of colon cancer cells cultured in the RWPV. The transport and mixing characteristics are first investigated with a step change in the perfusion inlet concentration by computing the time histories of the time to exceed 10% inlet concentration. The effects of a uniform cell utilization rate are then investigated with time histories of the outlet concentration, volume average concentration, and volume fraction starved. It is found that the operating conditions used in microgravity produce results that are quite different then those for ground-based conditions. Mixing times for microgravity conditions are significantly shorter than those for ground-based operation. Increasing the differential rotation rates (microgravity) increases the mixing and transport, while increasing the mean rotation rate (ground-based) suppresses both. Increasing perfusion rates enhances mass transport for both microgravity and ground-based cases, however, for the present range of operating conditions, above 5-10 cc/min there are diminishing returns as much of the inlet fluid is transported directly to the perfusion exit. The results show that exit concentration is not a good indicator of the concentration distributions in the vessel.

rotating_wall,31202677,Randomized Controlled Study of an Absorbable Vena Cava Filter in a Porcine Model.,"PURPOSE: To compare the safety and efficacy of an absorbable inferior vena cava (IVC) filter and a benchmark IVC filter in a porcine model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled Good Laboratory Practice study was performed in Domestic Yorkshire cross swine. Sixteen swine were implanted with an absorbable IVC filter (test device; Adient Medical, Pearland, Texas); 8 were implanted with a benchmark metal IVC filter (control device; Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana). All animals underwent rotational digital subtraction pulmonary angiography and cavography (anteroposterior and lateral) before filter deployment and 5 and 32 weeks after deployment. Terminal procedures and necropsy were performed at 32 weeks. The IVC, heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys were harvested at necropsy. The reported randomized controlled GLP animal study was conducted at Synchrony Labs, Durham, North Carolina. RESULTS: One animal died early in the test cohort of a recurring hemorrhage at the femoral access site resulting from a filter placement complication. All other animals remained clinically healthy throughout the study. No pulmonary embolism was detected at the 5- and 32-week follow-up visits. The absorbable filter subjects experienced less caval wall perforation (0% vs 100%) and thrombosis (0% vs 75%). The control device routinely perforated the IVC and occasionally produced collateral trauma to adjacent tissues (psoas muscle and aorta). The veins implanted with the absorbable filter were macroscopically indistinguishable from normal adjacent veins at 32 weeks except for the presence of radiopaque markers. Nontarget tissues showed no device-related changes. CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of the absorbable IVC filter in swine proved safe with no pulmonary emboli detected. There was complete to near-complete resorption of the filter polymer by 32 weeks with restoration of the normal appearance and structure of the IVC.",Eggers M; Rousselle S; Urtz M; Albright R; Will A; Jourden B; Godshalk C; Dria S; Huang S; Steele J,,2019,Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,Comparative Study; Journal Article,R44 HL127734/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,18663520,Three-dimensional rotational angiography of the inferior vena cava as an adjunct to inferior vena cava filter retrieval.,"The objective of this study was to explore the role of three-dimensional (3-D) rotational angiography (RA) of the inferior vena cava (IVC; 3-D CV) before filter retrieval and its impact on treatment planning compared with standard anteroposterior cavography (sCV). Thirty patients underwent sCV and 3-D CV before IVC filter retrieval. Parameters assessed were: projection of filter arms or legs beyond the caval lumen, thrombus burden within the filter and IVC, and orientation of the filter within IVC. Skin and effective radiation doses were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using paired Student t test and nonparametric McNemar's test. Standard anteroposterior cavography detected 49 filter arms or legs projecting beyond the caval lumen in 25 patients. Three-dimensional CV demonstrated 89 filter arms or legs projecting beyond the caval lumen in 28 patients. Twenty-two patients had additional filter arms or legs projecting beyond the caval lumen detected on 3-D CV that were not detected on sCV (p < 0.001). Filter apex tilt detection differed significantly (p < 0.001) between sCV and 3-D CV, with 3-D CV being more accurate. The filter apex abutted the IVC wall in 10 patients (33%) on 3-D CV, but this was diagnosed in only 3 patients (10%) with sCV. Thrombus was detected in 8 patients (27%), 1 thrombus of which was seen only on 3-D CV, and treatment was changed in this patient because of thrombus size. Mean effective radiation doses for 3-D CV were approximately two times higher than for sCV (1.68 vs. 0.86 mSv), whereas skin doses were three times lower (12.87 vs. 35.86 mGy). Compared with sCV, performing 3-D CV before optional IVC filter retrieval has the potential to improve assessment of filter arms or legs projecting beyond the caval lumen, filter orientation, and thrombus burden.",Bozlar U; Edmunds JS; Turba UC; Hartwell GD; Housseini AM; Hagspiel KD,,2009,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,Comparative Study; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,3217782,[Endarterectomy using a Simpson catheter in arterial insufficiency of the lower limbs].,"Treatment of arterial stenoses by the Simpson atherectomy catheter is carried out by resecting the atheroma. A rotating cutter housed in a cylindrical chamber with a lateral opening is applied against the arterial wall by a low-pressure balloon. Several cuts are made until a large enough diameter of arterial lumen is obtained. We report the results in the first 6 patients treated by this technique using 7F and 9F catheters. All had short (less than 2 cm) and narrow (greater than or equal to 70%) stenoses of iliac, superficial femoral or popliteal arteries. To reduce the stenoses to 30% or less, 4 to 11 cuts were necessary. Histological study of the fragments was performed. The result was inadequate in the only case of stenotic iliac artery and we proceeded with balloon dilatation. The small fragments obtained in this particular case were very hard and calcified. 4 patients with claudication (superficial femoral or popliteal stenosis) were asymptomatic after treatment, whereas one patient suffering from Burger's disease with acral necrotic lesions did not benefit from the procedure in spite of a good morphological result. No complication was encountered. This efficient technique is especially indicated in short segmental stenoses of femoro-popliteal or possibly iliac arteries. It avoids the usual intimal cracks associated with balloon angioplasty and produces a smooth surface whose long term benefit has still to be demonstrated.",Schneider PA; Bounameaux H; Cox JN,,1988,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,English Abstract; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,29843730,The effect of inlet and outlet boundary conditions in image-based CFD modeling of aortic flow.,"BACKGROUND: Computational modeling of cardiovascular flow is a growing and useful field, but such simulations usually require the researcher to guess the flow's inlet and outlet conditions since they are difficult and expensive to measure. It is critical to determine the amount of uncertainty introduced by these assumptions in order to evaluate the degree to which cardiovascular flow simulations are accurate. Our work begins to address this question by examining the sensitivity of flow to several different assumed velocity inlet and outlet conditions in a patient-specific aorta model. METHODS: We examined the differences between plug flow, parabolic flow, linear shear flows, skewed cubic flow profiles, and Womersley flow at the inlet. Only the shape of the inlet velocity profile was varied-all other parameters were identical among these simulations. Secondary flow in the form of a counter-rotating pair of vortices was also added to parabolic axial flow to study its effect on the solution. In addition, we examined the differences between two-element Windkessel, three element Windkessel and the outflow boundary conditions. In these simulations, only the outlet boundary condition was varied. RESULTS: The results show axial and in-plane velocities are considerably different close to the inlet for the cases with different inlet velocity profile shapes. However, the solutions are qualitatively similar beyond 1.75D, where D is the inlet diameter. This trend is also observed in other quantities such as pressure and wall shear stress. Normalized root-mean-square deviation, a measure of axial velocity magnitude differences between the different cases, generally decreases along the streamwise coordinate. The linear shear inlet velocity boundary condition and plug velocity boundary condition solution exhibit the highest time-averaged wall shear stress, approximately [Formula: see text] higher than the parabolic inlet velocity boundary condition. Upstream of 1D from the inlet, adding secondary flow has a significant impact on temporal wall shear stress distributions. This is especially observable during diastole, when integrated wall shear stress magnitude varies about [Formula: see text] between simulations with and without secondary flow. The results from the outlet boundary condition study show the Windkessel models differ from the outflow boundary condition by as much as [Formula: see text] in terms of time-averaged wall shear stress. Furthermore, normalized root-mean-square deviation of axial velocity magnitude, a measure of deviation between Windkessel and the outflow boundary condition, increases along the streamwise coordinate indicating larger variations near outlets. CONCLUSION: It was found that the selection of inlet velocity conditions significantly affects only the flow region close to the inlet of the aorta. Beyond two diameters distal to the inlet, differences in flow solution are small. Although additional studies must be performed to verify this result, the data suggest that it is important to use patient-specific inlet conditions primarily if the researcher is concerned with the details of the flow very close to the inlet. Similarly, the selection of outlet conditions significantly affects the flow in the vicinity of the outlets. Upstream of five diameters proximal to the outlet, deviations between the outlet boundary conditions examined are insignificant. Although the inlet and outlet conditions only affect the flow significantly in their respective neighborhoods, our study indicates that outlet conditions influence a larger percentage of the solution domain.",Madhavan S; Kemmerling EMC,Inlet boundary conditions; Outlet boundary conditions; Windkessel; Womersley,2018,Biomedical engineering online,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,21944911,Prevention of neointimal hyperplasia associated with modified stretch expanded polytetrafluoroethylene hemodialysis grafts (Gore) in an experimental preclinical study in swine.,"OBJECTIVE: Stenosis is the main cause of hemodialysis vascular graft failure and it is primarily caused by neointimal hyperplasia (NH) development at the vein-graft anastomosis. Even though NH development factors are well known, their activation pathway still remains disputed and the real role of the mismatch compliance between the vein and the graft wall has not yet been resolved. The purpose of this experimental study in swine was to verify the possibility of preventing the development of NH at the vein-graft anastomosis using a modified commercially available longitudinal stretch expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) Gore (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) graft (either standard or heparin-bonded) with an added handmade ePTFE radial stretch cuff at one end to reduce the compliance between the graft and the vein wall. METHODS: Twelve ePTFE stretch grafts (6 modified and 6 unmodified) were surgically placed as arterovenous grafts (AVGs) between the carotid artery and the external jugular vein in 6 pigs. In each pig, one modified graft was placed on one side and one corresponding unmodified graft on the other side as a control. In 4 pigs, standard stretch ePTFE Gore grafts were used, and in 2 pigs, heparin-bonded stretch Gore grafts were used; 2 pigs were also treated with antiplatelet drugs. All the implanted grafts had a total length of 8 cm and a diameter of 6 mm. The modified graft was realized by cutting a short segment of the commercially available graft lengthwise which was then sewn crosswise (rotated 90°) with the same diameter as the original graft and was then added to it. A Doppler ultrasound scan was used for monitoring the graft patency immediately, weekly, and before death. At death (21-28 days after implantation), artery, vein, and graft specimens were collected ""en bloc"" for histopathology. RESULTS: The modified grafts in the antiplatelet-treated animals were able to completely prevent NH development on vein wall (100% in 2 subjects) which was also reduced in antiplatelet untreated animals (66.5%, 96.4%, and 100% in 3 subjects, respectively). The modified standard stretch grafts and similarly modified heparin-bonded stretch grafts obtained the same good results in NH prevention. CONCLUSION: Data provide evidence of the efficacy of modified stretch ePTFE grafts with an added radial stretch cuff for the prevention of NH in swine models and support the hypothesis of the pivotal role of mismatch compliance between the graft and the vein wall in NH development. rights reserved.",Gessaroli M; Bombardi C; Giunti M; Bacci ML,,2012,Journal of vascular surgery,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,31309526,Design and Computational Validation of a Novel Bioreactor for Conditioning Vascular Tissue to Time-Varying Multidirectional Fluid Shear Stress.,"PURPOSE: The cardiovascular endothelium experiences pulsatile and multidirectional fluid wall shear stress (WSS). While the effects of non-physiologic WSS magnitude and pulsatility on cardiovascular function have been studied extensively, the impact of directional abnormalities remains unknown due to the challenge to replicate this characteristic in vitro. To address this gap, this study aimed at designing a bioreactor capable of subjecting cardiovascular tissue to time-varying WSS magnitude and directionality. METHODS: The device consisted of a modified cone-and-plate bioreactor. The cone rotation generates a fluid flow subjecting tissue to desired WSS magnitude, while WSS directionality is achieved by altering the alignment of the tissue relative to the flow at each instant of time. Computational fluid dynamics was used to verify the device ability to replicate the native WSS of the proximal aorta. Cone and tissue mount velocities were determined using an iterative optimization procedure. RESULTS: Using conditions derived from cone-and-plate theory, the initial simulations yielded root-mean-square errors of 22.8 and 8.4% in WSS magnitude and angle, respectively, between the predicted and the target signals over one cycle, relative to the time-averaged target values. The conditions obtained after two optimization iterations reduced those errors to 3.5 and 0.5%, respectively, and generated 0.2% and 0.01% difference in time-averaged WSS magnitude and angle, respectively, relative to the target waveforms. CONCLUSIONS: A bioreactor capable of generating simultaneously desired time-varying WSS magnitude and directionality was designed and validated computationally. The ability to subject tissue to in vivo-like WSS will provide new insights into cardiovascular mechanobiology and disease.",Liu J; Cornelius K; Graham M; Leonard T; Tipton A; Yorde A; Sucosky P,Cardiovascular; Directionality; Fluid wall shear stress; Hemodynamics; Mechanobiology,2019,Cardiovascular engineering and technology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Validation Study",,

However, the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of in vivo PA images are major challenges that prevent PAI from finding its place in clinics. This paper investigates the merit of spatial compounding of PA images in arterial phantoms and the achievable improvements of SNR, when in vivo conditions are mimicked. The analysis of the compounding technique was performed on a polyvinyl alcohol vessel phantom with black threads embedded in its wall. The in vivo conditions were mimicked by limiting the rotation range in ±30°, adding turbid surrounding medium, and filling the lumen with porcine blood. Finally, the performance of the technique was evaluated in ex vivo human carotid plaque samples. Results showed that spatial compounding elevates the SNR by 5-10 dB and CNR by 1-5 dB, depending on the location of the absorbers.

rotating_wall,11332738,Suppression of antigen-specific lymphocyte activation in modeled microgravity.,"Various parameters of immune suppression are observed in lymphocytes from astronauts during and after a space flight. It is difficult to ascribe this suppression to microgravity effects on immune cells in crew specimens, due to the complex physiological response to space flight and the resultant effect on in vitro immune performance. Use of isolated immune cells in true and modeled microgravity in immune performance tests, suggests a direct effect of microgravity on in vitro cellular function. Specifically, polyclonal activation of T-cells is severely suppressed in true and modeled microgravity. These recent findings suggest a potential suppression of oligoclonal antigen-specific lymphocyte activation in microgravity. We utilized rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors as an analog of microgravity for cell cultures to analyze three models of antigen-specific activation. A mixed-lymphocyte reaction, as a model for a primary immune response, a tetanus toxoid response and a Borrelia burgdorferi response, as models of a secondary immune response, were all suppressed in the RWV bioreactor.

rotating_wall,22156050,Multi-feature-based plaque characterization in ex vivo MRI trained by registration to 3D histology.,"We present a new method for automated characterization of atherosclerotic plaque composition in ex vivo MRI. It uses MRI intensities as well as four other types of features: smoothed, gradient magnitude and Laplacian images at several scales, and the distances to the lumen and outer vessel wall. The ground truth for fibrous, necrotic and calcified tissue was provided by histology and μCT in 12 carotid plaque specimens. Semi-automatic registration of a 3D stack of histological slices and μCT images to MRI allowed for 3D rotations and in-plane deformations of histology. By basing voxelwise classification on different combinations of features, we evaluated their relative importance. To establish whether training by 3D registration yields different results than training by 2D registration, we determined plaque composition using (1) a 2D slice-based registration approach for three manually selected MRI and histology slices per specimen, and (2) an approach that uses only the three corresponding MRI slices from the 3D-registered volumes. Voxelwise classification accuracy was best when all features were used (73.3 ± 6.3%) and was significantly better than when only original intensities and distance features were used (Friedman, p < 0.05). Although 2D registration or selection of three slices from the 3D set slightly decreased accuracy, these differences were non-significant.",van Engelen A; Niessen WJ; Klein S; Groen HC; Verhagen HJ; Wentzel JJ; van der Lugt A; de Bruijne M,,2012,Physics in medicine and biology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,16571875,Shear stress induces preimplantation embryo death that is delayed by the zona pellucida and associated with stress-activated protein kinase-mediated apoptosis.,"In this study, we discovered that embryos sense shear stress and sought to characterize the kinetics and the enzymatic mechanisms underlying induction of embryonic lethality by shear stress. Using a rotating wall vessel programmed to produce 1.2 dynes/cm2 shear stress, it was found that shear stress caused lethality within 12 h for E3.5 blastocysts. Embryos developed an approximate 100% increase in mitogen-activated protein kinase 8/9 (formerly known as stress-activated protein kinase/junC kinase 1/2) phosphorylation by 6 h of shear stress that further increased to approximately 350% by 12 h. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labeling/apoptosis was at baseline levels at 6 h and increased to approximately 500% of baseline at 12 h, when irreversible commitment to death occurred. A mitogen-activated protein kinase 8/9 phosphorylation inhibitor, D-JNKI1, was able to inhibit over 50% of the apoptosis, suggesting a causal role for mitogen-activated protein kinase 8/9 phosphorylation in the shear stress-induced lethality. The E2.5 (compacted eight-cell/early morula stage) embryo was more sensitive to shear stress than the E3.5 (early blastocyst stage) embryo. Additionally, zona pellucida removal significantly accelerated shear stress-induced lethality while having no lethal effect on embryos in the static control. In conclusion, preimplantation embryos sense shear stress, chronic shear stress is lethal, and the zona pellucida lessens the lethal and sublethal effects of shear stress. Embryos in vivo would not experience as high a sustained velocity or shear stress as induced experimentally here. Lower shear stresses might induce sufficient mitogen-activated protein kinase 8/9 phosphorylation that would slow growth or cause premature differentiation if the zona pellucida were not intact.",Xie Y; Wang F; Zhong W; Puscheck E; Shen H; Rappolee DA,,2006,Biology of reproduction,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",R01-HD40972/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,7609477,Bending of blood vessel wall: stress-strain laws of the intima-media and adventitial layers.,"In order to determine the stress-strain relationship of the inner (intima and media) and outer (adventitia) layers of blood vessels in the neighborhood of the zero-stress state, bending experiments were performed on aortic strips of rats. In the experiments, one end of a strip was clamped, and a force was applied on the other end. The deflection curves of the strips were measured. By regarding the aortic strip as a curved beam, the classical beam theory was employed to analyze the strain distribution from the experimental data. A computer program dealing with nonlinear equations and nonlinear least squares optimization was developed. Strains were referred to the zero-stress state. The load-deflection relationship was then used to determine the stress-strain relationship. Certain forms of the stress-strain laws were assumed. The linear laws fit the experimental data accurately, probably because the strains during bending are quite small, although the rotations are large. The Young's modulus of the inner layer, which consists of endothelial and smooth muscle cells and elastic lamina, was found to be three to four times larger than that of the outer layer which consists of collagen with a small amount of fibroblasts and elastin. The residual stresses and strains at the no-load state were calculated from the deduced stress-strain relationship. It is shown that large errors (up to 50 percent) in the values of the residual strains will occur if the wall material was treated as homogeneous, i.e., if the layered constitution was ignored.",Xie J; Zhou J; Fung YC,,1995,Journal of biomechanical engineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",HL 26647/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; HL 43026/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,

These fossae, therefore, are regarded as congenital and have been considered clinically and surgically as sites of internal abdominal hernias. The authors describe a peritoneal fossa interposed between the fourth portion of the duodenum and the abdominal aorta. Due to a scoliosis of the lumbar column, the abdominal aorta had shifted to the left of the duodenum, stretching two semilunar avascular peritoneal folds connecting the vessel with the ascending duodenum. These two folds bounded above and below an entrance into a fossa lined by the posterior parietal peritoneum and bordered by the fourth portion of the duodenum on the right and the aorta on the left. This recess extended as far as the anterior surface of the second and third lumbar vertebrae. On the basis of the anatomic findings, the authors suggest that acquired fossae, because of their size and topography, may play a part in the etiopathogenesis of internal abdominal hernias.",Barberini F; Carone VS; Caggiati A; Macchiarelli G; Correr S,,1999,Surgical and radiologic anatomy : SRA,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,18725092,Embedded inferior vena cava filter removal: use of endobronchial forceps.,"PURPOSE: Removing a retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filter can be extremely difficult with the use of standard techniques if the filter is tilted and embedded in the wall of the IVC. The use of rigid endobronchial forceps has been described in case reports to remove embedded IVC filters, and the present report describes the use of this technique to remove a series of tip-embedded IVC filters in two separate institutions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records were reviewed of 21 consecutive patients at two institutions who underwent attempted IVC filter removal with rigid endobronchial forceps over a 34-month period. The mean age of patients was 32.4 years (range, 14.1-54.1 y). The patients had the following filters: Recovery (n = 6), G2 (n = 10), Günther Tulip (n = 4), and OptEase (n = 1). RESULTS: Rotational or biplane venography was used to confirm that the filters were tilted and embedded in the wall of the IVC in all 21 patients. Rigid endobronchial forceps were used successfully to remove 20 embedded IVC filters in 21 patients. There was one case of failure to remove an embedded suprarenal G2 filter. There were no major complications. CONCLUSIONS: Rigid endobronchial forceps may be used as a reliable option for removal of embedded IVC filters.",Stavropoulos SW; Dixon RG; Burke CT; Stavas JM; Shah A; Shlansky-Goldberg RD; Trerotola SO,,2008,Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,15371267,Influence of head position on carotid hemodynamics in young adults.,"Studies in adults have shown marked changes in geometry and relative positions of the carotid arteries when rotating the head. The aim of this study was to quantify the change in geometry and analyze its effect on carotid hemodynamics as a result of head rotation. The right carotid arteries of nine young adult subjects were investigated in supine position with straight and left turned head positions, respectively. The three-dimensional (3D) carotid geometry was reconstructed by using 3D ultrasound (3D US), and the carotid hemodynamics were calculated by combining 3D US with computational fluid dynamics. It was observed that cross-sectional areas and shapes did not change markedly with head rotation, but carotid vessel center lines altered with planarification of the common carotid artery as a main feature (P < 0.05). Measured common carotid flow rates changed significantly at the individual level when the head was turned, but on the average, the change in mean common carotid flow rate was relatively small (0.37 +/- 1.11 ml/s). The effect of the altered center lines and flow rates on the atherogenic nature of the carotid bifurcation was evaluated by using calculated hemodynamic wall parameters, such as wall shear stress (WSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI). It was found that WSS and OSI patterns changed significantly with head rotation, but the variations were very subject dependent and could not have been predicted without assessing the altered geometry and flow of the carotid bifurcation for individual cases. This study suggests that there is a need for standardization of the choice of head position in the 3D US scan protocol, and that carotid stents and emboli diverters should be studied in different head positions.",Glor FP; Ariff B; Hughes AD; Verdonck PR; Barratt DC; Augst AD; Thom SA; Xu XY,,2004,American journal of physiology.

The effect of different metallic nanoparticles homogeneously suspended in the blood is considered, motivated by drug delivery (pharmacology) applications. The Eringen micropolar model has been discussed for hemorheological characteristics in the whole arterial region. The conservation equations for mass, linear momentum, angular momentum (micro-rotation), and energy and nanoparticle species are normalized by employing suitable non-dimensional variables. The transformed equations are solved numerically subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions using the finite element method with the variational formulation scheme available in the FreeFEM++ code. A good correlation is achieved between the FreeFEM++ computations and existing results. The effect of selected parameters (taper angle, Prandtl number, Womersley parameter, pulsatile constants, and volumetric concentration) on velocity, temperature, and micro-rotational (Eringen angular) velocity has been calculated for a stenosed arterial segment. Wall shear stress, volumetric flow rate, and hemodynamic impedance of blood flow are also computed. Colour contours and graphs are employed to visualize the simulated blood flow characteristics. It is observed that by increasing Prandtl number (Pr), the micro-rotational velocity decreases i.e., microelement (blood cell) spin is suppressed. Wall shear stress decreases with the increment in pulsatile parameters (B and e), whereas linear velocity increases with a decrement in these parameters. Furthermore, the velocity decreases in the tapered region with elevation in the Womersley parameter (α).

The importance of the subacromial bursa.,"We examined biopsy specimens obtained during surgery on 115 patients with complete rotator cuff rupture. The vascularised connective tissue covering the area of rupture and the proliferating cells in the fragmented tendons reflected more of the features of repair than of degeneration and necrosis. The main source of this fibrovascular tissue was the wall of the subacromial bursa. These features clearly indicated a vigorous reparative response which might play an important role in tendon reconstitution and remodelling. We therefore suggest that extensive debridement along with subtotal bursectomy, commonly practised during surgical repair of rotator cuff rupture, should be avoided. Although strong suture margins are essential for good operative results, debridement should be judicious and preserve as much as possible of the bursa and the associated fibrovascular tissue.",Uhthoff HK; Sarkar K,,1991,The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

rotating_wall,27637637,Lateral Position of the External Carotid Artery: A Rare Variation to Be Recognized During Carotid Endarterectomy.,"BACKGROUND: External carotid artery (ECA) positioned laterally to the internal carotid artery (ICA) at the level of the common carotid artery (CCA) bifurcation is occasionally encountered during carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This study aimed to determine the frequency of this phenomenon and provide technical tips for performing CEA. METHODS: The study included 199 consecutive patients (209 carotid arteries) who underwent CEA at Otaru Municipal Medical Center in 2007-2014. The position of the ECA with respect to the ICA at the CCA bifurcation was preoperatively rated as either lateral or normal, using three-dimensional computerized tomographic angiography (3-D CTA) anteroposterior projections. Postoperative diffusion-weighted images (DWIs), and postoperative 3-D CTA images were reviewed. RESULTS: Among the 209 carotid arteries with atherosclerosis, 11 instances (5.3 %) of lateral position of the ECA were detected in 11 patients. Ten of these arteries (91 %) were right-sided (odds ratio 11.1; 95 % confidence interval 1.38-88.9). Wider longitudinal exposure of the arteries was used during CEA, and the CCA and ECA were rotated clockwise or counter clockwise. The ICA lying behind the ECA along the surgical access route was then pulled out laterally and moved to the shallow surgical field. Cross-clamping, arteriotomy, plaque removal, and wall suturing were performed as usual. No cerebral infarcts were detected on postoperative DWIs, and 3-D CTA revealed no CCA and ICA kinking. CONCLUSIONS: Lateral position of the ECA is not extremely rare in patients undergoing CEA for atherosclerosis and may be a congenital variation, although this is still controversial. CEA can be performed safely if the arteries from the CCA to the ICA are rotated, and the ICA is moved to the shallow surgical field under wider longitudinal exposure. Although no postoperative cerebral infarcts were detected, the risk of artery-to-artery embolism resulting from artery repositioning prior to plaque removal should be taken into consideration.",Ito M; Niiya Y; Kojima M; Itosaka H; Iwasaki M; Kazumata K; Mabuchi S; Houkin K,Atherosclerosis; Carotid artery; Carotid endarterectomy; External carotid artery abnormalities; Variation,2016,Acta neurochirurgica.

Electrospinning conditions were optimized to produce non-woven tissue engineering scaffolds composed of individual fibrils less than 1000 nm in diameter. Each of these materials was then electrospun into a cylindrical construct with a 2 mm inside diameter with a wall thickness of 200-250 microm. Electrospun scaffolds of collagen were rapidly, and densely, infiltrated by interstitial and endothelial cells when implanted into the interstitial space of the rat vastus lateralis muscle.

rotating_wall,18932231,Rotating three-dimensional dynamic culture of adult human bone marrow-derived cells for tissue engineering of hyaline cartilage.,"The method of constructing cartilage tissue from bone marrow-derived cells in vitro is considered a valuable technique for hyaline cartilage regenerative medicine. Using a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor developed in a NASA space experiment, we attempted to efficiently construct hyaline cartilage tissue from human bone marrow-derived cells without using a scaffold. Bone marrow aspirates were obtained from the iliac crest of nine patients during orthopedic operation. After their proliferation in monolayer culture, the adherent cells were cultured in the RWV bioreactor with chondrogenic medium for 2 weeks. Cells from the same source were cultured in pellet culture as controls. Histological and immunohistological evaluations (collagen type I and II) and quantification of glycosaminoglycan were performed on formed tissues and compared. The engineered constructs obtained using the RWV bioreactor showed strong features of hyaline cartilage in terms of their morphology as determined by histological and immunohistological evaluations. The glycosaminoglycan contents per microg DNA of the tissues were 10.01 +/- 3.49 microg/microg DNA in the case of the RWV bioreactor and 6.27 +/- 3.41 microg/microg DNA in the case of the pellet culture, and their difference was significant. The RWV bioreactor could provide an excellent environment for three-dimensional cartilage tissue architecture that can promote the chondrogenic differentiation of adult human bone marrow-derived cells.",Sakai S; Mishima H; Ishii T; Akaogi H; Yoshioka T; Ohyabu Y; Chang F; Ochiai N; Uemura T,,2009,Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,23797242,Framework to co-register longitudinal virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound data in the circumferential direction.,"Considerable efforts have been directed at identifying prognostic markers for rapidly progressing coronary atherosclerotic lesions that may advance into a high-risk (vulnerable) state. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has become a valuable clinical tool to study the natural history of coronary artery disease (CAD). While prospectively IVUS studies have provided tremendous insight on CAD progression, and its association with independent markers (e.g., wall shear stress), they are limited by the inability to examine the focal association between spatially heterogeneous variables (in both circumferential and axial directions). Herein, we present a framework to automatically co-register longitudinal (in-time) virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS) imaging data in the circumferential direction (i.e., rotate follow-up image so circumferential basis coincides with corresponding baseline image). Multivariate normalized cross correlation was performed on paired images (n = 636) from five patients using three independent VH-IVUS defined parameters: artery thickness, VH-IVUS defined plaque constituents, and VH-IVUS perivascular imaging data. Results exhibited high correlation between co-registration rotation angles determined automatically versus manually by an expert reader ( r(2) = 0.90). Furthermore, no significant difference between automatic and manual co-registration angles was observed ( 91.31 ±1.04(°) and 91.07 ±1.04(°), respectively; p = 0.48) and Bland-Altman analysis yielded excellent agreement ( bias = 0.24(°), 95% CI +/- 16.33(°)). In conclusion, we have developed, verified, and validated an algorithm that automatically co-registers VH-IVUS imaging data that will allow for the focal examination of CAD progression.",Timmins LH; Suever JD; Eshtehardi P; McDaniel MC; Oshinski JN; Samady H; Giddens DP,,2013,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,29390616,The role of conductivity discontinuities in design of cardiac defibrillation.,"Fibrillation is an erratic electrical state of the heart, of rapid twitching rather than organized contractions. Ventricular fibrillation is fatal if not treated promptly. The standard treatment, defibrillation, is a strong electrical shock to reinitialize the electrical dynamics and allow a normal heart beat. Both the normal and the fibrillatory electrical dynamics of the heart are organized into moving wave fronts of changing electrical signals, especially in the transmembrane voltage, which is the potential difference between the cardiac cellular interior and the intracellular region of the heart. In a normal heart beat, the wave front motion is from bottom to top and is accompanied by the release of Ca ions to induce contractions and pump the blood. In a fibrillatory state, these wave fronts are organized into rotating scroll waves, with a centerline known as a filament. Treatment requires altering the electrical state of the heart through an externally applied electrical shock, in a manner that precludes the existence of the filaments and scroll waves. Detailed mechanisms for the success of this treatment are partially understood, and involve local shock-induced changes in the transmembrane potential, known as virtual electrode alterations. These transmembrane alterations are located at boundaries of the cardiac tissue, including blood vessels and the heart chamber wall, where discontinuities in electrical conductivity occur. The primary focus of this paper is the defibrillation shock and the subsequent electrical phenomena it induces. Six partially overlapping causal factors for defibrillation success are identified from the literature. We present evidence in favor of five of these and against one of them. A major conclusion is that a dynamically growing wave front starting at the heart surface appears to play a primary role during defibrillation by critically reducing the volume available to sustain the dynamic motion of scroll waves; in contrast, virtual electrodes occurring at the boundaries of small, isolated blood vessels only cause minor effects. As a consequence, we suggest that the size of the heart (specifically, the surface to volume ratio) is an important defibrillation variable.",Lim H; Cun W; Wang Y; Gray RA; Glimm J,,2018,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,1176809,Inhibition of platelet adherence to damaged surface of rabbit aorta.,"A method has been developed for quantitative measurement of adherence of rabbit platelets to the damaged intimal surface of everted segments of rabbit thoracic aorta. Platelets were labeled with 51Cr, washed, and resuspended in Tyrode solution containing 0.35 per cent albumin and apyrase. This suspending medium contains physiologic concentrations of calcium and magnesium; apyrase degrades any ADP lost from the platelets or from the damaged wall. Everted aorta segments were rotated in the platelet suspensions. Neither platelet aggregation nor lysis occurred and the platelets adhered to the subendothelium either as individual platelets or as a single layer. Damage caused by scraping the everted segments with a scalpel blade increased adherence 50-fold. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in vitro, or administered orally to the rabbits from which platelet suspensions were prepared, significantly reduced the number of platelets adherent to the damaged aorta wall. ASA affected only the platelets, and did not affect the damaged wall. Platelet adherence to the damaged wall was also reduced by the use of 4 per cent albumin in the suspending medium, or by the addition of citrate. Adherence of platelets resuspended in citrated plasma was low and further inhibition by ASA was not demonstrable. ASA may affect two aspects of thrombus formation: platelet adherence to subendothelial structures and the platelet release reaction induced by collagen (and possibly by other subendothelial structures). These studies show that ASA has a marked effect on adherence of platelets to subendothelium under conditions in which aggregation and thrombus formation are prevented.",Cazenave JP; Packham MA; Guccione MA; Mustard JF,,1975,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,17440693,Virtual angioscopy by means of three-dimensional rotational angiography of the aortoiliac arteries.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to report the different findings that can be visualised with virtual angioscopy starting from rotational angiography (RA) and three-dimensional (3D) image processing (3DRA) in the evaluation of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients showing an occlusive or aneurysmal disease of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries underwent intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) equipped with the RA function and a 3D workstation. We found that 3DRA is able to generate images of the examined vessels with a very effective 3D appearance; furthermore, it is able to create images of the lumen and wall of the vessel through two different modalities: endoviews and cross sections. The possibility of matching high-density structures (i.e. calcified plaques and stents) to standard 3D reconstructions of the examined arteries was applied. RESULTS: Different aspects of the arteries can be demonstrated in the angioscopic elaborations: the normal and stenotic lumen, artery bifurcations, the collateral vessel origins and the severity and extensions of atheromatous calcifications and their relationships to the vessel wall. Virtual angioscopy is able to visualise some devices (catheters, stents) introduced during diagnostic and interventional procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The constant technological evolution of diagnostic imaging is offering new image-processing techniques, providing new types of previously unexplored information. We present a summary of the different radiological findings that can be demonstrated with this new imaging technique.",Pozzi Mucelli F; Bruni S; Doddi M; Cova M,,2007,La Radiologia medica,Comparative Study; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,12141461,Advances in the mechanisms of cell delivery to cardiovascular scaffolds: comparison of two rotating cell culture systems.,"Having a reliable method of delivering cells to polymer scaffolds in vitro is fundamental to the development of tissue engineered structures. This paper compares the efficacy of two rotating systems for this purpose. Ten conduits, measuring 40 mm by 10 mm, were fabricated from polyglycolic acid mesh and poly-4-hydrobutyrate. Five conduits were placed in a rotating wall vessel (RWV, Synthecon Inc., Houston, TX), developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); five conduits were also placed in rotating individual sealed tubes (RISTs). Medium in the RWV was left unchanged for the duration of the experiment; medium in the RISTs required daily change. Samples of the discarded medium and samples from the RWV were analyzed for pH, pCO2, pO2, and lactate concentration. Constructs were assayed for DNA content as a surrogate for cell number. In the RWV, pH, pCO2, and pO2 remained stable, while the lactate concentration gradually increased. The measure of PO2 did not differ significantly between the RWV and the RISTs, but the pH was lower and the pCO2 and the lactate concentration measurements were higher in the RIST system at each time point (p = 0.001). After 6 days (p = 0.001), the total DNA per conduit was 226+/-7 microg for the conduits seeded in the RISTs and 396+/-18 microg for the conduits in the RWV, suggesting that the RWV is superior to the RIST system for delivering cells to polymer scaffolds.",Sutherland FW; Perry TE; Nasseri BA; Wang J; Kaushal S; Guleserian KJ; Martin DP; Vacant JP; Mayer JE Jr,,2002,ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992),"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","5R01 H16,043-03/PHS HHS/United States",
rotating_wall,31701357,Effects of Normal Variation in the Rotational Position of the Aortic Root on Hemodynamics and Tissue Biomechanics of the Thoracic Aorta.,"PURPOSE: Variation in the rotational position of the aortic root relative to the left ventricle is present in normal trileaflet aortic valves. Its impact on the resulting fluid mechanics of blood flow in the thoracic aorta and structural mechanics in the aortic wall are unknown. We aimed to determine the regional hemodynamic and biomechanical differences in different rotational positions of the normal aortic root (clockwise, central, and counterclockwise positions). METHOD: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) data was acquired from a normal pediatric patient. These were used for reconstruction of the aortic valve and thoracic aorta 3D model. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations were employed to study the influence of the root rotation with a central position as compared to observed extreme variations. Patient-specific phase-encoding CMR data were used to assess the validity of computed blood flow. The 3D FSI model was coupled with Windkessel boundary conditions that were tuned for physiological pressures. A grid velocity function was adopted for the valve motion during the systolic period. RESULTS: The largest wall shear stress level is detected in the clockwise positioned aortic root at the sinutubular junction. Two counter-rotating vortex cores are formed within the aortic root of both the central and extreme root configurations, however, in the clockwise root the vortex system becomes more symmetric. This also coincides with more entrainment of the valve jet and more turbulence production along the shear layer. CONCLUSION: A clockwise rotational position of the aortic root imparts an increased wall shear stress at the sinutubular junction and proximal ascending aorta in comparison to other root rotation positions. This may pose increased risk for dilation of the sinutubular junction and ascending aorta in the patient with a clockwise positioned aortic root compared to other normal positional configurations.",Sundström E; Jonnagiri R; Gutmark-Little I; Gutmark E; Critser P; Taylor MD; Tretter JT,Aorta; Aortic valve; Ascending aorta; Fluid–structure interaction; Magnetic resonance,2020,Cardiovascular engineering and technology,Comparative Study; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,21039810,Rotational mechanics of the left ventricle in AL amyloidosis.,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate whether alterations in left ventricular (LV) twisting and untwisting motion could be induced by cardiac involvement in patients with immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) systemic amyloidosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-five patients with AL amyloidosis and 26 control subjects were evaluated. After standard echocardiographic measurement and two-dimensional (2D) speckle tracking echocardiography, LV rotation at both basal and apical planes, twisting, twisting rate, and longitudinal strain were measured. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) derived early diastolic peak velocity at septal mitral annulus (E') was also evaluated. Twenty-six of 45 patients with systemic amyloidosis were classified as having cardiac amyloidosis (CA) if the mean value of the LV wall thickness was ≥ 12 mm or not (NCA) if this value was not reached. In NCA patients, both LV twist and untwisting rate were increased while they were decreased in CA patients making them similar to the control group. Longitudinal strain was reduced only in CA patients. Impaired relaxation as indicated by E' values was progressively reduced in the course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Both twisting and untwisting motions are increased in patients with AL systemic amyloidosis with no evidence of cardiac involvement while they are reduced in patients with evident amyloidosis cardiac involvement. This finding suggests that impaired LV relaxation induces a compensatory mechanism in the early phase of the disease, which fails in more advanced stage when both twisting and untwisting rates are reduced. The increase in LV rotational mechanics could be a marker of subclinical cardiac involvement.",Porciani MC; Cappelli F; Perfetto F; Ciaccheri M; Castelli G; Ricceri I; Chiostri M; Franco B; Padeletti L,,2010,"Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,1919066,Imaging of post-mortem coronary arteries by 30 MHz intravascular ultrasound.,"Intravascular ultrasound cross-sectional imaging of the atherosclerotic artery may be employed to guide plaque ablation by spark erosion, atherectomy, laser irradiation or other means. To assess whether in the coronary artery the echolucent zone of the three-layered ultrasound appearance of muscular arteries might be a reliable boundary to halt transluminal ablative angioplasty, epicardial coronary arteries were scanned under pressure over a distance of 4-8 cm at 1 mm intervals. A 5.2F catheter with a 30 MHz transducer rotating at 600 RPM was used. In 419 images from four post-mortem hearts, aged at death 22, 31, 56 and 82 years, the presence of a distinct echolucent zone was scored as percentage of the wall circumference. The median scores were 0%, 0%, 10% and 75%, respectively. In the three youngest hearts, the three-layered appearance was largely absent. In the 82 year old heart, in contrast, the three-layered appearance could generally be identified. Within subjects, the presence of an echolucent zone was variable in location. Qualitatively, neither abundant medial elastin tissue nor a reduced medial thickness could explain the absence of an echolucent zone when the ultrasound image was compared to the corresponding microscopic section. The results show that in the 82 year old heart, 30 MHz intravascular ultrasound discrimination of coronary wall layers would be adequate to guide transluminal plaque ablation. In the younger hearts, guided ablation would fail due to the limited presence of a distinct echolucent zone as an ultrasound landmark of the media. Whether the presence or absence of an echolucent zone is related to age remains to be determined.",Borst C; Savalle LH; Smits PC; Post MJ; Gussenhoven WJ; Bom N,,1991,International journal of cardiac imaging,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Cells that were pre-oriented towards the narrower diameter section of the tapered capillary swam with high directional persistence, following conical-helix trajectories along the capillary wall. The confinement of the tapered capillary significantly diminished the mean swimming speed of filamentous cells when compared to their unrestricted mean swimming speed. The cell body rotation of individual filamentous bacteria decreased along the tapered direction, likely due to increased steric interactions with the capillary wall. Filamentous cells that swam under imposed flow rates ranging from 0.2 μl/min to 0.8 μl/min showed positive rheotaxis inside the 150 μm-350 μm diameter region of the tapered capillary. Depending on the imposed flow rate, none of the bacteria could advance beyond a critical diameter in the tapered capillary. This critical diameter is likely to be the position of the maximum shear rate they can tolerate without being flushed away. This work showed experimental evidence of how a simple flow constriction such as a tapered tube forms a hydrodynamic barrier that can deter the advance of bacterial rheotaxis. reserved.",Jaimes-Lizcano YA; Hunn DD; Papadopoulos KD,Filamentous cells; Motility; Restrictive geometry; Rheotaxis; Swimming,2014,Research in microbiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

In three ex vivo specimens of left coronary arteries in oil, MSCT was performed after intracoronary injection of four solutions of contrast material (400 mgI/ml iomeprol). The four solutions were diluted as follows: 1/infinity, 1/200, 1/80, and 1/20. All scans were performed with the following parameters: slices/collimation 16/0.75 mm, rotation time 375 ms. Each specimen was scored for the presence of atherosclerotic plaques. In each plaque the attenuation was measured in four regions of interest for lumen, plaque (non-calcified thickening of the vessel wall), calcium, and surrounding (oil surrounding the vessel). The results were compared with a one-way analysis of variance test and were correlated with Pearson's test. There were no significant differences in the attenuation of calcium and oil in the four solutions. The mean attenuation in the four solutions for lumen (35+/-10, 91+/-7, 246+/-18, 511+/-89 HU) and plaque (22+/-22, 50+/-26, 107+/-36, 152+/-67 HU) was significantly different between each decreasing dilution (p<0.001). The mean attenuation of lumen and plaque of coronary plaques showed high correlation, while the values were significantly different (r=0.73; p<0.001).

Five French and 8F rotating A scan intravascular ultrasound catheters were used to obtain 48 images in four superficial femoral arteries, five iliac arteries, and one aorta in eight patients undergoing vascular surgery. Cross-sectional areas measured by intravascular ultrasonography were compared to cross-sectional areas calculated by uniplanar angiography of the same location in the vessel. Maximum and minimum luminal diameters were also measured from intravascular ultrasound images. An ellipticity index was defined as the maximum/minimum diameter ratio (max/min) and ranged from 1.0 to 1.8 (mean, 1.2). Comparison of the cross-sectional areas measured from intravascular ultrasound images and those calculated from uniplanar angiography showed no significant difference at any level of ellipticity studied. However, when the values of cross-sectional areas were analyzed in groups corresponding to the diameter of the vessel, that is, aortic, iliac, and femoral, the values for the iliac arteries calculated from uniplanar angiography were significantly greater by 9.8% +/- 0.7% (n = 29, p = 0.03) when compared to those measured by intravascular ultrasonography. In addition to providing accurate luminal determinations, intravascular ultrasound images displayed transmural morphology, the location and character of the atherosclerotic lesions, and the thickness of the vessel wall.

rotating_wall,18180018,Characterization of the mitral isthmus for atrial fibrillation ablation using intracardiac ultrasound from within the coronary sinus.,"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation involving the mitral isthmus and/or the coronary sinus (CS) may result in circumflex artery (Cx) or other collateral structure damage. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of intracardiac echocardiographic (ICE) imaging from within the CS to characterize mitral isthmus anatomy and guide ablation. METHODS: A 9-Fr sheath was introduced into the CS of 30 patients before AF ablation. A 9-Fr rotational ICE catheter was then advanced within the sheath to the distal CS adjacent to the lateral left atrial (LA) wall. Serial cross-sectional images to document the relations of the LA, Cx, CS, esophagus, and pericardium were obtained at multiple points within the CS during a pullback to the CS ostium. RESULTS: The Cx was identified in 62/150 positions in 25/30 patients. The median (range) of the LA-Cx distance was 3.3 mm (0.7-19.6 mm), and the median CS-Cx distance was 2.0 mm (0.4-9.7 mm). The esophagus was seen in 36/150 positions in 17/30 patients. The median CS-esophagus distance was 4.0 mm (1.4-16.2 mm). The proximity of the Cx and esophagus to the LA and CS varied considerably. The median CS-mitral annulus distance was 11.9 mm (4.1-21.6 mm). After CS cannulation, the ICE imaging took 5 +/- 2 minutes and required 120 +/- 60 seconds of fluoroscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Mitral isthmus anatomy can be accurately characterized by rotational ICE imaging from within the CS. There is great variability in the location and proximity of the Cx, CS, esophagus, and pericardium to the LA. Real-time identification of these structures could help to plan ablation strategies and potentially reduce complications.",West JJ; Norton PT; Kramer CM; Moorman JR; Mahapatra S; DiMarco JP; Mangrum JM; Mounsey JP; Ferguson JD,,2008,Heart rhythm,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,9590505,Simulated microgravity conditions enhance differentiation of cultured PC12 cells towards the neuroendocrine phenotype.,"We are studying microenvironmental cues which contribute to neuroendocrine organ assembly and tissue-specific differentiation. As our in vitro model, we cultured rat adrenal medullary PC12 pheochromocytoma cells in a novel cell culture system, the NASA rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. This ""simulated microgravity"" environment in RWV bioreactors, characterized by randomizing gravitational vectors and minimizing shear stress, has been shown to favor macroscopic tissue assembly and to induce tissue-specific differentiation. We hypothesized that the unique culture conditions in the RWV bioreactors might enhance the in vitro formation of neuroendocrine organoids. To test our hypothesis, we evaluated the expression of several markers of neuroendocrine differentiation in cultures of PC12 cells maintained for up to 20 d in the slow turning lateral vessel (STLV) type RWV. PC12 cell differentiation was assessed by morphological, immunological, biochemical and molecular techniques. PC12 cells, cultured under ""simulated microgravity"" conditions, formed macroscopic, tissue-like organoids several millimeters in diameter. Concomitantly, the expression of phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase (PNMT), but not of other catecholamine synthesizing enzymes, was enhanced. Increased PNMT expression, as verified on both the gene and protein level, was accompanied by an increase in the specific activity of the enzyme. Furthermore, after 20 d in culture in the STLV, we observed altered patterns of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and prolonged activation of c-fos, a member of the AP-1 nuclear transcription factor complex.

All microvascular anastomoses in this series were performed using a back wall technique, in which the microsutures are placed in the back wall of the vessel first, and turning over of the microclamp is eliminated. This back wall technique is useful for microvascular reconstruction in a deep abdominal cavity in which there is no room to turn over the microclamp. In LRLTs, even if the hepatic artery of the graft liver is so short that the microclamp on it cannot be rotated, this technique overcomes such difficult situations. Microvascular anastomosis without turning over the clamp is superior to the conventional method in terms of reducing intimal damage to the vessels. The vessels located vertical to the microvascular surgeon are smoothly anastomosed using this technique. The authors advocate this back wall technique as advantageous in microsurgical reconstructions of the hepatic and superior mesenteric arterial systems.",Yamamoto Y; Sugihara T; Sasaki S; Furukawa H; Furukawa H; Okushiba S; Nohira K,,1999,Journal of reconstructive microsurgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,15028044,Impact of catheter ablation on pulmonary vein morphology and mechanical function.,"INTRODUCTION: Previous reports have documented that radiofrequency catheter ablation of pulmonary veins induces a significant increase in the peak velocity of transvenous blood flow. Although the magnitude of the increase infers a state of pulmonary vein stenosis, there have been no reports of direct visualization of the ablation zone. METHODS AND RESULTS: In each of 23 subjects, the myocardium investing one or more pulmonary veins (total of 42 veins) was electrically isolated by applying a confluent circumferential ablation lesion to the atrial side of the venoatrial junction. Doppler measurements of transvenous flow velocity were made before and after ablation using phased-array intracardiac echocardiography. Direct visualization of the ablation zone was performed using rotating intracardiac echocardiography, permitting assessment of shape, cross-sectional area, phasic variation in cross-sectional area, and wall thickness. In a subset of 5 subjects, a more detailed assessment of the ablation and contiguous regions was performed using three-dimensional echocardiography (rotating transducer). Prior to ablation, venoatrial junctions demonstrated noncircular shape and marked phasic variation in cross-sectional area. There was a trivial transvenous pressure gradient. After ablation, there was a significant increase in both anterograde and retrograde flow velocities and pressure gradient, the magnitudes of which were inversely proportional to the preablation and postablation areas. Direct visualization of the ablation zone revealed circumferential wall swelling, reduced cross-sectional area, and diminishment in phasic variation in cross-sectional area. Similar observations were made at contiguous nonablated sites, diminishing in magnitude as a function of distance.

rotating_wall,8182963,A new perivascular multi-element pulsed Doppler ultrasound system for in vivo studies of velocity fields and turbulent stresses in large vessels.,"A pulsed Doppler ultrasound (PDU) multi-element system was developed for perivascular registration of velocity fields and turbulence in large vessels. In vivo evaluation and comparison with hot-film anemometry (HFA) was performed. C-shaped shells were designed with holes to fit five small 10 MHz ultrasonic probes directed at five measuring points along a diameter perpendicular to the vessel axis. By rotating the shell in 45 degrees steps, blood velocities were measured in 17 points covering the entire cross-sectional vessel area. Measurements were performed in the ascending aorta and at three axial locations in the descending thoracic aorta in pigs. Simultaneous PDU and HFA measurements were performed distal to induced vascular stenoses of different degrees. Three-dimensional visualisation of velocity profiles was made, and Reynolds normal stresses (RNS) were calculated for different levels of turbulence intensities based on the simultaneous PDU and HFA measurements. The velocity profiles in the ascending aorta were skewed at top systole with the highest velocities towards the posterior wall. In the descending thoracic aorta at the ligmentum of Botalli, the velocity profiles were skewed throughout the entire systole with the highest velocities at the right anterior vessel wall. Further downstream in the descending aorta the velocity profiles appeared blunter. The frequency response of the modified PDU system was determined by a 'random noise test' revealing an upper -3dB cut-off frequency of approximately 200 Hz. Regression analysis showed a linear relationship between RNS measured with PDU and RNS measured with HFA (r = 0.93). Two vessel diameters distal to a 75% stenosis RNS up to 28 N m-2 were measured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Nygaard H; Hasenkam JM; Pedersen EM; Kim WY; Paulsen PK,,1994,Medical & biological engineering & computing,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,27440745,"Carotid artery longitudinal wall motion is associated with local blood velocity and left ventricular rotational, but not longitudinal, mechanics.","Recent studies have identified a predictable movement pattern of the common carotid artery wall in the longitudinal direction. While there is evidence that the magnitude of this carotid artery longitudinal wall motion (CALM) is sensitive to cardiovascular health status, little is known about the determinants of CALM The purpose of this integrative study was to evaluate the contribution of left ventricular (LV) cardiac motion and local blood velocity to CALM Simultaneous ultrasound measurements of CALM, common carotid artery mean blood velocity (MBV), and left ventricular motion were performed in ten young, healthy individuals (6 males; 22 ± 1 years). Peak anterograde CALM occurred at a similar time as peak MBV (18.57 ± 3.98% vs. 18.53 ± 2.81% cardiac cycle; t-test: P = 0.94; ICC: 0.79, P < 0.01). The timing of maximum retrograde CALM displacement was different, but related, to both peak apical (41.00 ± 7.81% vs. 35.33 ± 5.79% cardiac cycle; t-test: P < 0.01; ICC: 0.79, P < 0.01) and basal rotation (41.80 ± 6.12% vs. 37.30 ± 5.66% cardiac cycle; t-test: P < 0.01; ICC: 0.74, P < 0.01) with peak cardiac displacements preceding peak CALM displacements in both cases. The association between basal rotation and retrograde CALM was further supported by strong correlations between their peak magnitudes (r = -0.70, P = 0.02), whereas the magnitude of septal longitudinal displacement was not associated with peak CALM (r = 0.11, P = 0.77). These results suggest that the rotational mechanical movement of the LV base may be closely associated with longitudinal mechanics in the carotid artery. This finding may have important implications for interpreting the complex relationship between ventricular and vascular function. behalf of the American Physiological Society and The Physiological Society.",Au JS; Ditor DS; MacDonald MJ; Stöhr EJ,Carotid artery longitudinal wall motion; left ventricular rotation; ultrasound,2016,Physiological reports,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

IVUS has many advantages over coronary angiography: it has better resolution and shows many hidden lesions. IVUS has helped uncover the underlying mechanisms of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), restenosis, the use and value of other interventional techniques such as directional coronary atherectomy (DCA), rotational atherectomy and stent implantation, and has great value in planning complex interventional procedures.

rotating_wall,8874931,Guidewire bias: potential source of complications with rotational atherectomy.,"The guidewire in rotational atherectomy is an integral component in the ablative process. It functions not only to deliver the device but sets the cutting vector when the burr advances. Since the guidewire is a stiff stainless steel monofilament and the vessels are frequently tortuous and angulated, the guidewire may not be centrally oriented, but may bias preferentially to one side of the arterial wall. This may result in tangential or radial cutting. The following cases illustrate the dependence of the ablative process on the lie of the guidewire and the importance of integrating this factor in proper use of the Rotablator system.",Reisman M; Harms V,,1996,Catheterization and cardiovascular diagnosis,Case Reports; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,30919887,Increased rotational flow in the proximal aortic arch is associated with its dilation in bicuspid aortic valve disease.,"AIMS: Aortic dilation in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) might extend to the proximal arch. Arch flow dynamics and their relationship with this segment dilation are still unexplored. Using 4D-flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance, we analysed flow dynamics in the arch for each BAV morphotype and their association with this segment dilation. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eleven BAV patients (aortic diameters ≤55 mm, non-severe valvular disease), 21 age-matched tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) patients with dilated arch and 24 healthy volunteers (HV) underwent 4D-flow. BAV were classified per fusion morphotype: 75% right-left (RL-BAV), and per arch dilation: 57% dilated, mainly affecting the right-noncoronary (RN) BAV (86% dilated vs. 47% in RL-BAV). Peak velocity, jet angle, normalized displacement, in-plane rotational flow (IRF), wall shear stress, and systolic flow reversal ratio (SFRR) were calculated along the thoracic aorta. ANCOVA and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify correlates of arch dilation. BAV had higher rotational flow and eccentricity than TAV in the proximal arch. Dilated compared with non-dilated BAV had higher IRF being more pronounced in the RN-morphotype. RN-BAV, IRF, and SFRR were independently associated with arch dilation. Aortic stenosis and male sex were independently associated with arch dilation in RL-BAV. Flow parameters associated with dilation converged to the values found in HV in the distal arch. CONCLUSION: Increased rotational flow could explain dilation of the proximal arch in RN-BAV and in RL-BAV patients of male sex and with valvular stenosis. These patients may benefit from a closer follow-up with cardiac magnetic resonance or computed tomography. The Author(s) 2019.

rotating_wall,16140501,Reconstruction of blood propagation in three-dimensional rotational X-ray angiography (3D-RA).,"This paper presents a framework of non-interactive algorithms for the mapping of blood flow information to vessels in 3D-RA images. With the presented method, mapping of flow information to 3D-RA images is done automatically without user interaction. So far, radiologists had to perform this task by extensive image comparisons and did not obtain visualizations of the results. In our approach, flow information is reconstructed by forward projection of vessel pieces in a 3D-RA image to a two-dimensional projection series capturing the propagation of a short additional contrast agent bolus. For accurate 2D-3D image registration, an efficient patient motion compensation technique is introduced. As an exemplary flow-related quantity, bolus arrival times are reconstructed for the vessel pieces by matching of intensity-time curves. A plausibility check framework was developed which handles projection ambiguities and corrects for noisy flow reconstruction results. It is based on a linear programming approach to model the feeding structure of the vessel. The flow reconstruction method was applied to 12 cases of cerebral stenoses, AVMs and aneurysms, and it proved to be feasible in the clinical environment. The propagation of the injected contrast agent was reconstructed and visualized in three-dimensional images. The flow reconstruction method was able to visualize different types of useful information. In cases of stenosis of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), flow reconstruction can reveal impeded blood flow depending on the severeness of the stenosis. With cases of AVMs, flow reconstruction can clarify the feeding structure. The presented methods handle the problems imposed by clinical demands such as non-interactive algorithms, patient motion compensation, short reconstruction times, and technical requirements such as correction of noisy bolus arrival times and handling of overlapping vessel pieces. Problems occurred mainly in the reconstruction and segmentation of 3D-RA images in cases of complex AVMs. The concentration of injected contrast agent was often not sufficient to provide highly contrasted vessels in 3D-RA images. Another segmentation-related problem is known as 'kissing vessels' [19]. Kissing vessel artifacts introduce artificial vessel junctions and thereby distort the feeding structure of the vessel. This may finally cause implausible flow reconstruction results and inverse flow directions in vessel segments. We are currently planning to validate our reconstruction results using particle imaging velocimetry (PIV). PIV experiments with phantoms, for which the true flow parameters are known, will allow for the assessment of the accuracy of our contrast agent based method. In the context of computational fluid dynamics techniques, the potential of the presented flow reconstruction method is high. Flow reconstruction results based on the presented method could be used both as boundary conditions for simulations and as a reference for the validation of simulation results. Computational fluid dynamics provide useful information such as arterial wall shear stress and complex flow patterns in aneurysms.",Schmitt H; Grass M; Suurmond R; Köhler T; Rasche V; Hähnel S; Heiland S,,2005,Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,10826745,Hydrodynamic properties of a new percutaneous intra-aortic axial flow pump.,"Cardiac intervention, myocardial infarction, or postoperative heart failure will sometimes create a need for circulatory support. For this purpose, a new, minimally invasive intra-aortic cardiac support system with a foldable propeller has been developed. In animals, the pump has been shown to have a positive hemodynamic influence, and the present study evaluates the hydraulic properties of the pump in a bench test. The axial flow pump is a catheter system with a distal motor driven foldable propeller (0-15,000 revolutions per minute). To protect the aortic wall, filaments forming a cage surround the propeller. In the present study, tests were done with two different pumps, one with and one without the cage. Two different models were used, one for testing pressure generation and one for obtaining flow-pressure characteristics. Propellers and tubes with different diameters were studied, and pressure and flow characteristics were measured. The mathematical relationships between pressure and rotational speed, pressure, and diameter of propeller and tube were determined. There was a positive relationship between the revolutions per minute and the generated pressure, a positive relationship between the diameter of the propeller and pressure, and a negative relationship between the diameter of the tube and the generated pressure. Within the physiologic range of cardiac output, there was a small drop in pressure with increasing flow in the tubes with a small diameter. With an increasing diameter of the tube, a smaller pressure drop was seen with increasing flow. The present cardiac support system has hydraulic properties, which may be of clinical relevance for patients with left ventricular heart failure.",Reitan O; Sternby J; Ohlin H,,2000,ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992),Journal Article,,

We tested the hypothesis that simulated microgravity does not affect cell adhesion. Human colorectal carcinoma cells were cultured in the NASA Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) under low shear stress with randomization of the gravity vector that simulates microgravity. After 6-7 days, cells were assayed for binding to various substrates and compared to cells grown in standard tissue culture flasks and static suspension cultures. The RWV cultures bound as well to basement membrane proteins and to CEA, an intercellular adhesion molecule, as control cultures did.

rotating_wall,15047378,Tissue velocity imaging of coronary artery by rotating-type intravascular ultrasound.,"Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) provides not only the dimensions of coronary artery but the information of tissue components. In catheterization laboratory, soft and hard plaques are classified by visual inspection of echo intensity. So-called soft plaque contains lipid core or thrombus and it is believed to be more vulnerable than a hard plaque. However, it is not simple to analyze the echo signals quantitatively. When we look at a reflection signal, the intensity is affected by the distance of the object, the medium between transducer and objects and the fluctuation caused by rotation of IVUS probe. The time of flight is also affected by the sound speed of the medium and Doppler shift caused by tissue motion but usually those can be neglected. Thus, the analysis of RF signal in time domain can be more quantitative than intensity of RF signal. In the present study, a novel imaging technique called ""intravascular tissue velocity imaging"" was developed for searching a vulnerable plaque. Radio-frequency (RF) signal from a clinically used IVUS apparatus was digitized at 500 MSa/s and stored in a workstation. First, non-uniform rotation was corrected by maximizing the correlation coefficient of circumferential RF signal distribution in two consecutive frames. Then, the correlation and displacement were calculated by analyzing the radial difference of RF signal. Tissue velocity was determined by the displacement and the frame rate. The correlation image of normal and atherosclerotic coronary arteries clearly showed the internal and external borders of arterial wall. Soft plaque with low echo area in the intima showed high velocity while the calcified lesion showed the very low tissue velocity. This technique provides important information on tissue character of coronary artery.",Saijo Y; Tanaka A; Owada N; Akino Y; Nitta S,,2004,Ultrasonics,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,31340820,Evaluation of flow changes after telescopic stenting of a giant fusiform aneurysm of the vertebrobasilar junction.,"BACKGROUND: The use of flow-diverters for non-saccular cerebral posterior circulation aneurysms requires complex deployment techniques and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Therefore, further studies are required to clarify the effect of stenting on post-treatment hemodynamics in such aneurysms. In this study, we evaluated flow alterations in a treated giant fusiform aneurysm of the vertebrobasilar junction and correlated them with the clinical outcome. METHODS: A patient-specific aneurysm model was acquired by rotational angiography, and three SILK flow-diverters (4.5 × 40, 5 × 40 and 5.5 × 40 mm) were virtually deployed in series along the basilar and right vertebral arteries. Image-based blood flow simulations before and after the treatment were performed under realistic pulsatile flow conditions. The flow reduction, velocity and wall shear stress (WSS) distribution, streamlines and WSS-derived parameters were evaluated before and after the treatment. RESULTS: The computed velocity streamlines showed substantial alterations of the flow pattern in the aneurysm and successful redirection of blood flow along the series of flow-diverters with no flow through the overlapping stents. The obtained flow reduction of 86% was sufficient to create thrombogenic flow conditions. Moreover, a 6.2-fold increase in relative residence time and a decrease by 87% of time-averaged WSS contributed to a successful treatment outcome observed during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: We found a correlation between the numerically predicted flow alterations and the available treatment outcome. This shows the potential of image-based simulations to be used in clinical practice for treatment planning and estimation of possible risk factors associated with a complex stent deployment in fusiform aneurysms of the posterior circulation.",Sindeev S; Kirschke JS; Prothmann S; Frolov S; Liepsch D; Berg P; Zimmer C; Friedrich B,Computational fluid dynamics; Flow-diverter; Fusiform aneurysm; Intracranial aneurysm; Posterior circulation; Vertebrobasilar junction,2019,Biomedical engineering online,Journal Article,16-15-10327/Russian Science Foundation/,

Using this relationship, we design, simulate, and implement a proof-of-concept, GPU-based active-control system, which shows consistent success in controlling mode rotation in both feedforward and feedback operation. Controllability is limited by operating conditions, the electrode's voltage range, and by the electrode's proximity to the vessel's walls.

The sensitivity of the flow field is sought with respect to geometry reconstruction procedure and mathematical model choice in numerical simulations. Taking as example a patient specific intracranial aneurysm located on an outer bend under steady state simulations, it is found that the sensitivity to geometry variability is greater, but comparable, to the one of the rheological model. These sensitivities are not quantifiable a priori. The flow field exhibits a wide range of shear stresses and slow recirculation regions that emphasize the need for careful choice of constitutive models for the blood. On the other hand, the complex geometrical shape of the vessels is found to be sensitive to small scale perturbations within medical imaging resolution. The sensitivity to mathematical modeling and geometry definition are important when performing numerical simulations from in vivo data, and should be taken into account when discussing patient specific studies since differences in wall shear stress range from 3% to 18%.",Gambaruto AM; Janela J; Moura A; Sequeira A,,2011,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

rotating_wall,15000128,Parathyroid hormone-related protein is a gravisensor in lung and bone cell biology.,"Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein (PTHrP) has been shown to be essential for the development and homeostatic regulation of lung and bone. Since both lung and bone structure and function are affected by microgravity, we hypothesized that 0 x g down-regulates PTHrP signaling. To test this hypothesis, we suspended lung and bone cells in the simulated microgravity environment of a Rotating Wall Vessel Bioreactor, which simulates microgravity, for up to 72 hours. During the first 8 hours of exposure to simulated 0 x g, PTHrP expression fell precipitously, decreasing by 80-90%; during the subsequent 64 hours, PTHrP expression remained at this newly established level of expression. PTHrP production decreased from 12 pg/ml/hour to 1 pg/ml/hour in culture medium from microgravity-exposed cells. The cells were then recultured at unit gravity for 24 hours, and PTHrP expression and production returned to normal levels. Based on these findings, we have obtained bones from rats flown in space for 2 weeks (Mission STS-58, SL-2). Analysis of PTHrP expression by femurs and tibias from these animals (n=5) revealed that PTHrP expression was 60% lower than in bones from control ground-based rats. Interestingly, there were no differences in PTHrP expression by parietal bone from space-exposed versus ground-based animals, indicating that the effect of weightlessness on PTHrP expression is due to the unweighting of weight-bearing bones. This finding is consistent with other studies of microgravity-induced osteoporosis. The loss of the PTHrP signaling mechanism may be corrected using chemical agents that up-regulate this pathway. In conclusion, PTHrP represents a stretch-sensitive paracrine signaling mechanism that may sense gravity.",Torday JS,,2003,Advances in space research : the official journal of the Committee on Space,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",HL55268/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,12738153,The relationship of tension-free vaginal tape insertion and the vascular anatomy.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the proximity of the major vessels in the retropubic space and anterior abdominal wall to the tension-free vaginal tape needle. METHODS: Tension-free vaginal tape needles were inserted bilaterally in ten cadavers. Dissection of the superficial epigastric, inferior epigastric, external iliac, and obturator vessels was performed. Measurements from the lateral aspect of the needle to the medial edge of the vessels were recorded. In an additional cadaver, three planes were created by placing a string from the midlabia to the shoulder, mid-biceps brachii muscle, and 6 cm lateral to the mid-biceps brachii muscle of the cadaver's extended, ipsilateral arm. An operator, blinded to the retropubic space anatomy, passed the needle in these planes bilaterally. The distances from the needle to the external iliac and obturator vessels were measured. RESULTS: All vessels measured were lateral to the tension-free vaginal tape needle. The mean distance from the tension-free vaginal tape needle to the obturator vessels was the closest: 3.2 cm (range 1.6-4.3 cm). The mean distance from the tension-free vaginal tape needle to the superficial epigastric vessels was 3.9 cm (range 0.9-6.7); to the inferior epigastric vessels, 3.9 cm (range 1.9-6.6 cm); and to the external iliac vessels, 4.9 cm (range 2.9-6.2 cm). When the needle was directed 6 cm lateral to the mid-biceps brachii muscle, the external iliac vein was punctured. CONCLUSION: The major vessels in the retropubic space and anterior abdominal wall lie 0.9-6.7 cm lateral to the tension-free vaginal tape needles.

METHODS: An endoscopic probe was developed to guide an OCT laser beam onto human cadaver eye tissue samples to detect CCs. The prototype probe consisted of two gradient-index (GRIN) lenses that were housed in two stainless steel needles, respectively. The probe scanned the laser beam across a fan shape area by rotating the two GRIN lenses. The authors built a swept source OCT system to provide the depth scans. Human cadaver eye tissue was prepared for imaging. OCT images were acquired while the wall of SC was scanned. After successfully locating the opening of a CC on the SC wall from the OCT images, the authors applied scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to image the sample for comparison. RESULTS: The prototype probe focused the laser beam to a working distance of approximately 1.4 mm (in air), with spot sizes ranging from 12 to 14 μm. The fan shape scan area had a radius of 3 mm and an arc angle of approximately 40°. Acquired OCT images clearly showed a CC opening on the wall of SC with the channel going into the sclera, from which quantitative measurements were made. Results from OCT and SEM show good agreement with each other.

The biomatrix conduit is formed in a living animal and the wall consists of a complete, naturally produced matrix reinforced with polyester mesh. We propose that the microarchitecture of the matrix lining the lumen may promote endothelial cell attachment without pretreatment with adhesive proteins or extra cellular matrix components. Endothelial cell adhesion to the biomatrix surface was assessed by subjecting conduits seeded with ovine aortic endothelial cells (OAEC) to physiological range shear stresses of 16 and 32 dyn/cm2 in vitro. OAECs were isolated, cultured and seeded (1 x 10(6) cells/ml) by rotation onto the luminal surface of 20 cm lengths of biomatrix vascular conduits (n = 36). The seeded conduits were divided into three groups and cultured either for 24 h (n = 12), 48 h (n = 12) or 72 h (n = 12). Following culture, the conduits from each group were subjected to flow rates of either 240 ml/min (n = 6) or 480 ml/min (n = 6) with heparinized sheep blood for 1 h. Luminal surface cell cover was determined pre- and post-flow from Datura stramonium lectin labeled en face preparations. Histological analysis demonstrated that OAECs attach to the luminal surface of biomatrix conduits and form confluent monolayers within 24-48 h. Flow testing revealed that, for both flow rates and independent of the time in culture, there was no significant decrease in cell cover after flow (p = 0.13). The results support the hypothesis that a vascular conduit, engineered from a naturally formed biomatrix, provides a suitable substrate for the formation of flow resistant endothelium.",Birchall IE; Lee VW; Ketharanathan V,,2001,Biomaterials,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Computational fluid dynamics and flow rig testing have suggested there are advantages to spiral laminar flow. The aim of this study was to identify whether spiral laminar is the predominant flow pattern in a cohort of volunteers. METHODS: This study included 42 volunteers (mean age 66.8 years). Eleven arterial sites were examined, comprising bilateral examination of the common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, external carotid artery, common femoral artery, superficial femoral artery, and the infra renal aorta. The presence or absence of spiral laminar flow, the peak systolic velocity, and the rotational velocity were assessed by colour Duplex scanning. RESULTS: The incidence of spiral laminar flow ranged from 81% in the internal carotid artery to 90% in the common carotid artery and the infra renal aorta. Overall, in 58% of all right-sided arteries the rotation was clockwise and 42% anticlockwise. In all left-sided arteries these numbers were reversed. Analysis on the basis of volunteer rather than examination site showed that 41/42 (97%) had more sites with spiral laminar flow than without. Only one volunteer had more sites exhibiting non-spiral laminar flow. CONCLUSION: Spiral laminar flow was the predominant flow pattern in the study population. This observation raises questions and suggests a need for further studies concerning the form and function of the left ventricle, the geometry of the arterial system, and the function of the arterial wall.",Stonebridge PA; Suttie SA; Ross R; Dick J,Arterial flow; Spiral laminar flow,2016,European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of,Journal Article,,

We studied 35 morbidly obese patients who were qualified for bariatric surgery. The control group consisted of 20 non-obese people. Blood rheological measurements were performed using the Laser-assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyzer (Mechatronics, the Netherlands) and a cone-plate viscometer (Brookfield DV-II). The venous flow dynamics were assessed using a duplex ultrasound. The shear rate was estimated from the measured blood flow velocity and the diameter of the femoral vein. Venous wall shear stress was calculated from the whole blood viscosity and the shear rate. The shear rate (P < 0.005) and the venous wall shear stress (P < 0.05) were significantly lower in obese patients compared with the controls. The aggregation index (P < 0.001), syllectogram amplitude - AMP (P < 0.05) and Tslow (P < 0.001) were significantly higher in the obese patients; the aggregation half-time (P < 0.001) and Tfast (P < 0.001) were decreased compared with the control group. Multivariate regression analyses found waist circumference (β -0.31, P < 0.05), thigh circumference (β 0.33, P < 0.05) and Tslow (β -0.47, P < 0.005) to be variables that independently influenced the shear rate. Nevertheless, the AMP (β 0.34, P < 0.05) and Tslow (β -0.47, P < 0.01) were independent predictors that influenced the wall shear stress. This study indicates that there is a relationship between wall shear stress in the femoral vein and the rheological impairment of the RBC among obese patients, but further studies are necessary to confirm this suggestion.",Wiewiora M; Piecuch J; Glűck M; Slowinska-Lozynska L; Sosada K,,2013,Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,1097999,The restoration of the vasculature of skin autografts in the rabbit.,"The restoration of the vasculature of full-thickness skin autografts was investigated on the rabbit ear, the grafted discs of skin being replaced with their original orientation, or rotated 90 or 180 degrees. Circulation in the graft was first detected 1 day after grafting, increasing on the 2nd and successive days. The larger arteries in the grafts survived and became permanently joined at the periphery of the grafts to adjacent severed arteries in the host by well-defined and often tortuous segments termed junction vessels. The pre-operative vascular pattern was re-established when grafts were replaced without rotation but comparable survival of arteries also occurred when the grafted discs of skin were rotated. In most grafts, the segment of artery became stabilized by 4-9 weeks; more than 75% of the length of the arterial segments survived in 83% of grafts, with minimal accompanying histological changes in their walls. There was some increase in number and aborization of small vessels in the established grafts, although the vascular pattern was essentially similar to that of unoperated skin. The factors possibly involved in the survival of the large arteries in the grafts include the relative rigidity of the arterial wall, the early establishment of circulation, and the favourable haemodynamic position of the grafts.",Stevens SM,,1975,Pathology,Journal Article,,

However, its utility in visualizing and quantifying coronary morphology has been limited by its 2D tomographic nature. This study presents a 3D reconstruction technique that accurately preserves 3D geometric information. METHODS AND RESULTS: Images obtained from manual IVUS pullbacks and continuous bi-plane angiography were fused, using angiography to reconstruct the transducer trajectory and aid in solving for the correct rotational orientation. A novel 3D active surface method automatically identified the luminal and medial-adventitial borders which, when superimposed on the transducer trajectory, could be surface-rendered for visualization and morphometry. Segmentation agreed well with manual assessment, and 3D luminal shape matched that of angiography when projected to 2D. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that this method provides an accurate reconstruction of the vessel's anatomy, which accounts for the true curvature of the vessel.",Cothren RM; Shekhar R; Tuzcu EM; Nissen SE; Cornhill JF; Vince DG,,2000,International journal of cardiac imaging,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,8063844,Influence of endocardial-epicardial crossover of muscle fibers on left ventricular wall mechanics.,"The influence of variations of fiber direction on the distribution of stress and strain in the left ventricular wall was investigated using a finite element model to simulate the mechanics of the left ventricle. The commonly modelled helix fiber angle was defined as the angle between the local circumferential direction and the projection of the fiber path on the plane perpendicular to the local radial direction. In the present study, an additional angle, the transverse fiber angle, was used to model the continuous course of the muscle fibers between the inner and the outer layers of the ventricular wall. This angle was defined as the angle between the circumferential direction and the projection of the fiber path on the plane perpendicular to the local longitudinal direction. First, a reference simulation of left ventricular mechanics during a cardiac cycle was performed, in which the transverse angle was set to zero. Next, we performed two simulations in which the spatial distribution of either the transverse or the helix angle was varied with respect to the reference situation, the spatially averaged variations being about 3 and 14 degrees, respectively. The changes in fiber orientation hardly affected the pressure-volume relation of the ventricle, but significantly affected the spatial distribution of active muscle fiber stress (up to 50% change) and sarcomere length (up to 0.1 micron change). In the basal and apical region of the wall, shear deformation in the circumferential-radial plane was significantly reduced by introduction of a nonzero transverse angle. Thus, the loading of the passive tissue may be reduced by the endocardial-epicardial crossover of the muscle fibers.",Bovendeerd PH; Huyghe JM; Arts T; van Campen DH; Reneman RS,,1994,Journal of biomechanics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,21801315,Computational simulations demonstrate altered wall shear stress in aortic coarctation patients treated by resection with end-to-end anastomosis.,"BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic plaque in the descending thoracic aorta (dAo) is related to altered wall shear stress (WSS) for normal patients. Resection with end-to-end anastomosis (RWEA) is the gold standard for coarctation of the aorta (CoA) repair, but may lead to altered WSS indices that contribute to morbidity. METHODS: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were created from imaging and blood pressure data for control subjects and age- and gender-matched CoA patients treated by RWEA (four males, two females, 15 ± 8 years). CFD analysis incorporated downstream vascular resistance and compliance to generate blood flow velocity, time-averaged WSS (TAWSS), and oscillatory shear index (OSI) results. These indices were quantified longitudinally and circumferentially in the dAo, and several visualization methods were used to highlight regions of potential hemodynamic susceptibility. RESULTS: The total dAo area exposed to subnormal TAWSS and OSI was similar between groups, but several statistically significant local differences were revealed. Control subjects experienced left-handed rotating patterns of TAWSS and OSI down the dAo. TAWSS was elevated in CoA patients near the site of residual narrowings and OSI was elevated distally, particularly along the left dAo wall. Differences in WSS indices between groups were negligible more than 5 dAo diameters distal to the aortic arch. CONCLUSIONS: Localized differences in WSS indices within the dAo of CoA patients treated by RWEA suggest that plaque may form in unique locations influenced by the surgical repair. These regions can be visualized in familiar and intuitive ways allowing clinicians to track their contribution to morbidity in longitudinal studies.

rotating_wall,15002577,Modulation of human endothelial cell behaviour in simulated microgravity.,"Eukaryotic organisms are influenced by gravitational forces in their environment. The low gravitational forces endured by organisms in space alter cellular processes in cultured mammalian cells. Endothelial cells represent an interesting model to study because of their crucial role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, from atherosclerosis to inflammation to any situation characterized by dysregulated angiogenesis. We therefore cultured human endothelial cells derived from the umbilical vein in Rotating Wall Vessels (RWV) that simulate microgravity on earth. Under these experimental conditions, cells are viable and no increase in apoptotic rate was observed. They grow reproducibly faster than controls up to 8 days from seeding. Because endothelial proliferation is crucial in angiogenesis, we evaluated other steps required for new blood vessels to form. We found no variations in the levels of metalloproteases and an increased synthesis of their inhibitors (TIMP), suggesting that hypogravity does not induce a pro-angiogenic phenotype. Since i) alterations of blood pressure have been observed in astronauts and ii) endothelial cell synthesize vasoactive molecules, we evaluated the synthesis of nitric oxide and prostacyclin, both potent vasodilators and inhibitors of platelet aggregation. We observed that human endothelial cells grown in hypogavity synthesize higher amounts of prostacyclin and nitric oxide than controls. More studies are ongoing to understand the molecular basis of these events and their role in altering the physiology of the vascular tree.",Carlsson SI; Bertilaccio MT; Ascari I; Bradamante S; Maier JA,,2002,Journal of gravitational physiology : a journal of the International Society for,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Study of 40 dissections].,"In order to explore the possibility of serratus anterior muscle (SAM) flap transposition in head-neck and thoracic surgery, we performed an anatomical study including 40 dissections of the muscle's vascular pedicle, the subscapular-thoracodorsal axis, which is a branch of the axillary artery (A. subscapularis A. thoracodorsalis). The SAM is characterized by: its location: extending from the anterior and lateral aspect of the thorax to the medial border of the scapula; its easy surgical access; its constant and reliable vascularization by the thoracodorsal artery, a branch of the subscapular artery; its long arc of rotation allowing the utilization of the SAM flap in head and neck and mediastinal surgery without microvascular anastomoses; its versatility in comparison with other perithoracic muscles. These considerations prompted us to use the SAM in head and neck reconstructive surgery, chest wall surgery, chest wall reconstruction following resection for tumor; breast reconstruction; intrathoracic and mediastinal surgery, reinforcement of high-risk tracheobronchial sutures or anastomoses; management of bronchopleural fistulas and empyema spaces; repair of tracheo esophageal fistulas and tracheal or esophageal defects.",Vu P; Guedon C; Gehanno P; Andreassian B,,1989,Journal de chirurgie,English Abstract; Journal Article,,

MRI images were used to reconstruct the subject specific three-dimensional solid models of the LVA and RVA from the level of the carotid bifurcation to the vertebrobasilar junction (VJ). Geometric parameters such as cross sectional area ratio, curvature, tortuosity and branch angle were estimated. MR-PCA was used to obtain the blood flow waveforms for the two positions and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were used to assess the flow field in terms of wall shear stress (WSS) relative residence times (RRT) and localized normalized helicity (LNH). Significant geometric changes but moderate flow changes were observed for both vertebral arteries with head rotation. The CFD results at the VJ show that head rotation causes changes in the WSS distribution, RRT and LNH. Further studies are warranted to assess the clinical significance of the results in terms of atherosclerosis development at the VJ and how the observed geometric changes may affect blood flow to the brain in healthy subjects and vertebral artery stenosis patients, and in terms of increased rapture susceptibility in vertebrobasilar aneurysm patients.",Aristokleous N; Seimenis I; Georgiou GC; Nicolaides A; Anayiotos AS,,2015,Annals of biomedical engineering,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,10712382,Fluid shear stress induces heat shock protein 60 expression in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo.,"Recent investigations indicate that the initial event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis involves an (auto)immunologic injury to the vessel wall. Heat shock proteins (hsps), which are expressed on the endothelial cell surface, constitute possible autoantigens. After being exposed to shear stress of 30 dyne/cm(2) in vitro by means of a rotational viscometer, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were immunohistochemically stained for hsp 60 by the monoclonal antibody ML-30; static control cells were negative. Maximal hsp 60 induction was observed after 12 hours of hemodynamic stress. In Northern blots, the level of hsp 60 mRNA was markedly increased after only 1 hour of shear stress in human umbilical vein endothelial cells compared with static control cells. In vivo investigations in Lewis rats confirmed these in vitro findings: the intima and media of frozen sections of the right common carotid artery exposed to increased wall shear stress (after ligation of the left common carotid artery) were stained for hsp 60. The vessel wall of the left low-shear-stress-exposed side was negative. These findings demonstrate that shear stress results in hsp 60 induction in endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro, providing the prerequisite for humoral and cellular reactions to endothelial hsp in the earliest stages of atherosclerosis.",Hochleitner BW; Hochleitner EO; Obrist P; Eberl T; Amberger A; Xu Q; Margreiter R; Wick G,,2000,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,19869752,STUDIES ON THE BLOOD VESSELS IN THE MEMBRANES OF CHICK EMBRYOS : PART III. ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BLOOD VESSELS AT DIFFERENT AGES.,"On the basis of the anatomical studies presented the following inferences or conclusions are drawn. 1. In the course of development there appear in the vascular membranes of chick embryos arterial vessels of all calibers, namely, capillaries, small arteries with 2 or 3 cell layers, and large arteries formed of endothelium, longitudinal and circular layers of muscle and adventitia. 2. In none of the stages are elastic fibers developed. Only in the most central portion of the umbilical artery, in that portion namely which is to be regarded as belonging to the embryo, are elastic fibers discoverable. 3. The structure of capillaries is histologically the same at all stages. The small arteries of embryos 10 days old resemble histologically those of 18. At no stage of development are appearances of degeneration nor of fat to be found in arteries. When the physiological results of our investigations are compared with the anatomical ones the following comments may be made. In respect to Paragraph 1 of the anatomical results we may remark that when we study the different forms of the wall of arterial vessels the most delicate vessels consisting of single cells exhibit the greatest irritability. Those which are built of 3 to 4 muscle layers are less irritable. Stouter vessels appearing for the first time at 10 days of incubation require stronger stimuli to bring about the same reaction. In respect to Paragraph 2 of the anatomical results we may make this comment. The absence of elastic fibers in all arteries of the embryonic membranes throughout the period of their development is important in defining a physiological property of the larger vessels. The medium and larger vessels, beginning with the 4th day of incubation, contract differently from normal adult human arteries. In the contracted state they appear in cross section not as small replicas of larger circular structures, but take on a new form. During the course of contraction they become flat and appear band-like as would a garden hose when it is compressed by a weight. In examining a vessel so contracted one sees on rotating the vessel either a broad side or a narrow one. It is for this reason that such arteries appear alternately narrow as a line or broad as a band. It is not until the narrow artery is elevated with a hook that its uniform band-like nature becomes evident. The absence of elastic tissue, the presence of which in all probability is mainly responsible for the usual shape of arteries on cross section, permits one to see how the phenomenon which has been described may come about. Concerning Paragraph 3 of the anatomical conclusions we have this to say. According to the histological investigation a stage of degeneration is wanting in the blood vessels of the embryonic membrane in a sense in which one is accustomed to see such changes in other blood vessel systems during the course of life. On the day of hatching the constituent cells and fibers of the arteries of all calibers are anatomically the same as in their early development. These vessels do not die as the result of aging: The nutrient fluid ceases to flow because of contraction of the umbilical vessels. The blood vessels die in complete possession of their physiological irritability and anatomical integrity. The unaltered irritability of blood vessels of the same caliber at all ages is consonant with their unaltered anatomical structure.",Cohn AE; Lange F,,1930,The Journal of experimental medicine,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,33624474,[Indocyanine green angiography technique assisted brachial artery perforator propeller flap to repair soft tissue defects of trunk and upper limb].,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of using indocyanine green (ICG) angiography to detect brachial artery perforators, and the clinical application of brachial artery perforator propeller (BAPP) flaps to repair soft tissue defects of the trunk and upper limbs. METHODS: Between August 2016 and February 2019, ICG angiography was used to detect the perforating vessels of the brachial artery muscle septum, and the BAPP flaps were cut out with the detected perforating vessels as the pedicle to repair 19 cases of trunk and upper limb soft tissue defects. There were 12 males and 7 females, with an average age of 28.6 years (range, 5-66 years). Etiologies included the post-burn scar in 10 cases, soft-tissue sarcoma in 5 cases, congenital melanocytic nevi in 2 cases, chronic chest wall ulcer in 1 case, and malignant melanoma in 1 case. Defects located in axilla in 8 cases, chest wall in 4 cases, elbow in 5 cases, and shoulder in 2 cases. The area of the defect ranged from 15 cm×3 cm to 20 cm×8 cm. Pre-transfer tissue expansion was used in 11 patients. Thirteen flaps were pedicled with 1 perforator vessel, and 6 flaps were pedicled with 2 perforator vessels. The length of the vascular pedicle was 2.5-4.5 cm, with an average of 3.08 cm. The area of the skin flap ranged from 11 cm×5 cm to 22 cm×10 cm. The flap rotation angle was 110° in 1 case, 120° in 1 case, and 180° in 17 cases. Except for one donor site repaired by skin graft, the other donor sites were directly sutured. RESULTS: A total of 24 perforating vessels of the brachial artery muscle septum were detected by ICG angiography, 26 were identified during the operation, with an accuracy rate of 92.31%. Eighteen flaps survived without arteriovenous crisis. Venous congestion was observed in the distal 3-cm of one flap and the flap survived after conservative management. Intraoperative analysis showed that the blood perfusion of the distal 4-cm of one flap was poor, the relative value was less than 32%, the flap survived after removing the poor perfusion area. All the patients were followed up 3 to 23 months (mean, 8.6 months). The color and texture of the flap were similar to those of the recipient area. Flap debulking was not needed in all patients owing to the thinness of the flap. The contracture symptoms of patients with scar contracture on the medial of the elbow joint and axilla were significantly improved; a patient with malignant melanoma underwent tumor resection at 1 year and 5 months after operation due to tumor recurrence, and additional surgery was done to remove the recurrent tumor. No tumor recurrence was found in other patients. CONCLUSION: The ICG angiography technique can be used to explore the perforating vessels of the brachial artery muscle septum. The BAPP flap pedicled with the perforating vessels can be used for the repair of skin and soft tissue defects in the chest wall, axilla, shoulder, and elbow joint.",Xie T; Liu Y; Han T; Zhu S; Zang M; Chen B; Li S,Brachial artery; angiography technique; indocyanine green; propeller flap; septocutaneous perforator,2021,Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi =,Journal Article,,

The aim of this study was to assess the morphological and elastic properties of the aorta and large arteries and the impact on left ventricular (LV) mechanics in children with TA. METHODS: Seven pediatric TA patients (6 female patients, 13.8 ± 3.2 years) were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging, vascular ultrasound, applanation tonometry, and echocardiography from February 2015 until July 2017 and compared with 7 age- and sex-matched controls. Takayasu arteritis disease activity was assessed clinically by the Pediatric Vasculitis Activity Score (PVAS). RESULTS: Pediatric TA patients showed increased carotid-to-radial artery pulse wave velocity (8.1 ± 1.8 vs. 6.4 ± 0.6 m/s, p = 0.03) and increased carotid-to-femoral artery pulse wave velocity (8.3 ± 1.9 vs. 5.1 ± 0.8 m/s, p < 0.01) when compared with controls. Patients demonstrated increased LV mass index (74.3 ± 18.8 vs. 56.3 ± 10.9 g/m, p = 0.04), altered myocardial deformation with increased basal rotation (-9.8 ± 4.5 vs. -4.0 ± 2.0 degrees, p = 0.01) and torsion (19.9 ± 8.1 vs. 9.1 ± 3.1 degrees, p = 0.01), and impaired LV diastolic function with decreased mitral valve E/A ratio (1.45 ± 0.17 vs. 2.40 ± 0.84, p = 0.01), increased mitral valve E/E' ratio (6.8 ± 1.4 vs. 4.9 ± 0.7, p < 0.01), and increased pulmonary vein A-wave velocity (26.7 ± 5.7 vs. 16.8 ± 3.3 cm/s, p = 0.03). Carotid-to-radial artery pulse wave velocity was associated with systolic (R = 0.94, p < 0.01), diastolic (R = 0.85, p = 0.02), and mean blood pressure (R = 0.91, p < 0.01), as well as disease activity by PVAS (R = 0.75, p = 0.05). The PVAS was associated with carotid-to-radial artery pulse wave velocity (R = 0.75, p = 0.05), as well as systolic (R = 0.84, p = 0.02), diastolic (R = 0.82, p = 0.03), and mean blood pressure (R = 0.84, p = 0.02).

rotating_wall,25116869,Widening and high inclination of the middle cerebral artery bifurcation are associated with presence of aneurysms.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation is a preferred site for aneurysm formation. Wider bifurcation angles have been correlated with increased risk of aneurysm formation. We hypothesized a link between the presence of MCA aneurysms and the angle morphology of the bifurcation. METHODS: Three-dimensional rotational angiography volumes of 146 MCA bifurcations (62 aneurysmal) were evaluated for angle morphology: parent-daughter angles (larger daughter Ф1, smaller daughter Ф2), bifurcation angle (Ф1+Ф2), and inclination angle (γ) between the parent vessel axis and the plane determined by daughter vessel axes. Statistics were evaluated using Wilcoxon rank-sum analysis and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve. RESULTS: Aneurysmal bifurcations had wider inclination angle γ (median 57.8° versus 15.4°; P<0.0001). Seventy-five percent of aneurysmal MCAs had γ >10°, compared with 25% nonaneurysmal. Ф1 and Ф2, but especially Ф1+Ф2, were significantly larger in aneurysmal bifurcations (median 171.3° versus 98.1°; P<0.0001). Sixty-seven percent of aneurysmal bifurcations had Ф1+Ф2 >161°, compared with 0% nonaneurysmal MCAs. An optimal threshold of 140° was established for Ф1+Ф2 (area under the curve, 0.98). Sixty-eight percent of aneurysms originated off the daughter branches. Seventy-six percent of them originated off the branch with the largest branching angle, specifically if this was the smaller daughter branch. Wider Ф1+Ф2 correlated with aneurysm neck width, but not dome size. CONCLUSIONS: MCA bifurcations harboring aneurysms have significantly larger branching angles and more often originate off the branch with the largest angle. Wider inclination angle is strongly correlated with aneurysm presence, a novel finding.

rotating_wall,21516987,Aortic location and flat chest in scoliosis: a prospective study.,"BACKGROUND: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis tends to be complicated with spine and ribcage deformities. In addition to the coronal curvature, among the features of right thoracic scoliosis, flat chest, ribcage rotation, cardiac compression and an aortic left shift are also observed. Aorta is known to shift in a leftward direction, especially at the mid-thoracic level. The cause of aortic left shift in scoliosis is not known. To clarify the features of a scoliosis deformity, especially the relationship of the aortic left shift and the flat chest in scoliosis, we investigated the CT scan images of scoliosis patients. METHODS: For the measurement of scoliosis patients, the pre-operative CT scans of 22 patients with non-congenital right thoracic scoliosis were recruited. For controls, 25 age-matched non-scoliosis patients were recruited. The aortic location, the ribcage rotation angle and chest depth were measured by CT scan. The chest depth was defined as the smallest inner chest cavity depth between the anterior vertebral body and the anterior inner chest wall. RESULTS: Chest depth in scoliosis patients was found to be significantly narrower than the control group at every thoracic level, from T6 to T11. The aortic left shift was significantly larger in scoliosis patients at all measured levels. The chest depth correlated with an aortic leftward shift (r = 0.49). The aortic location was found to be correlated with the ribcage rotation angle (r = -0.52), and the ribcage rotation angle correlated with the thoracic side curvature (r = 0.61) CONCLUSIONS: In right thoracic scoliosis, an aortic left shift correlated with both flat chest and the ribcage rotation.",Doi T; Harimaya K; Matsumoto Y; Iwamoto Y,,2011,Fukuoka igaku zasshi = Hukuoka acta medica,Journal Article,,

The procedure is named ""Anterior approach"", which is characterized by transection of hepatic parenchyma without mobilization and rotation of the right hepatic lobe. The transection directly reaches the ventral surface of the retrohepatic inferior vena cava first at the portion of caudate process. The hepatic parenchymal transection proceeds from ventral to dorsal and from caudal to cranial. Several dorsal short hepatic veins are severed on the ventral surface of the IVC and the right hepatic vein is finally severed from inside.

Although specific adhesion mechanisms are involved in leukocyte-endothelium interactions, adhesion patterns in vivo suggest other rheological mechanisms also play a role. Previous studies have proposed that the abundance of leukocyte rolling in postcapillary venules is due to interactions between red blood cells (RBCs) and leukocytes as they enter postcapillary expansions, but the details of the fluid dynamics have not been elucidated. We have analyzed the interactions of red and white blood cells as they flow from a capillary into a postcapillary venule using a lattice Boltzmann approach. This technique provides the complete solution of the flow field and quantification of the particle-particle forces in a relevant geometry. Our results show that capillary-postcapillary venule diameter ratio, RBC configuration, and RBC shape are critical determinants of the initiation of cell rolling in postcapillary venules.

rotating_wall,25280096,"Widening of the basilar bifurcation angle: association with presence of intracranial aneurysm, age, and female sex.","OBJECT: Arterial bifurcations represent preferred locations for aneurysm formation, especially when they are associated with variations in divider geometry. The authors hypothesized a link between basilar apex aneurysms and basilar bifurcation (α) and vertebrobasilar junction (VBJ) angles. METHODS: The α and VBJ angles were measured in 3D MR and rotational angiographic volumes using a coplanar 3-point technique. Angle α was compared between age-matched cohorts in 45 patients with basilar artery (BA) aneurysms, 65 patients with aneurysms in other locations (non-BA), and 103 nonaneurysmal controls. Additional analysis was performed in 273 nonaneurysmal controls. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed on parametric BA models with increasing angles. RESULTS: Angle α was significantly wider in patients with BA aneurysms (146.7° ± 20.5°) than in those with non-BA aneurysms (111.7° ± 18°) and in controls (103° ± 20.6°) (p < 0.0001), whereas no difference was observed for the VBJ angle. A wider angle α correlated with BA aneurysm neck width but not dome size, which is consistent with CFD results showing a widening of the impingement zone at the bifurcation apex. BA bifurcations hosting even small aneurysms (< 5 mm) had a significantly larger α angle compared with matched controls (p < 0.0001).

rotating_wall,19873628,The microrheology of red blood cell suspensions.,"The general problem of microrheology is to predict the macroscopic flow properties of a material from a detailed description of the behavior of its constituent elements. This approach has been used to study suspensions of human red cells in plasma or Ringer's solution flowing steadily in rigid tubes 8-25 times the red cell diameter by observing individual cell motions under the microscope. The results have been compared with those previously obtained with model particles under similar conditions. In very dilute suspensions single red cells rotated in orbits similar to those of rigid discs at low flow rates, but, in common with model deformable particles, were observed to migrate away from the tube wall. Linear rouleaux of red cells rotated as rodlike particles and were flexible, bending during their rotational orbits in a manner similar to that of filaments of nylon or Dacron. Transparent concentrated suspensions were produced by preparing ghost cells reconstituted in biconcave form in plasma. In these, the motions of some unhemolyzed red cells were followed. The erythrocyte velocity profiles were blunted at concentrations above 20%; the cell paths were erratic because of frequent radial displacements, especially at the tube periphery, with the particles being markedly deformed and oriented parallel to the flow. Finally, the difference in flow pattern in large and small vessels is discussed and some relevant model experiments are described.",Goldsmith HL,,1968,The Journal of general physiology,Journal Article,,

This is based on a point-spectroscopy scanning time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy technique enabling reconstruction of fluorescence lifetime images (FLIm) and providing information on arterial intima composition and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) providing information on arterial wall morphology. The catheter design allows for independent rotation of the ultrasonic and optical channels within an 8 Fr outer diameter catheter sheath and integrates a low volume flushing channel for blood removal in the optical pathways. In the current configuration, the two channels consist of (a) a standard 3 Fr IVUS catheter with single element transducer (40 MHz) and (b) a side-viewing fiber optic (400 μm core). Experiments conducted in tissue phantoms showed the ability of the catheter to operate in an intraluminal setting and to generate coregistered FLIm and IVUS in one pull-back scan. Current results demonstrate the feasibility of the catheter for simultaneous bimodal interrogation of arterial lumen and for generation of robust fluorescence lifetime data under IVUS guidance.

rotating_wall,25242132,Deviation from optimal vascular caliber control at middle cerebral artery bifurcations harboring aneurysms.,"Cerebral aneurysms form preferentially at arterial bifurcations. The vascular optimality principle (VOP) decrees that minimal energy loss across bifurcations requires optimal caliber control between radii of parent (r₀) and daughter branches (r1 and r2): r₀(n)=r₁(n)+r₂(n), with n approximating three. VOP entails constant wall shear stress (WSS), an endothelial phenotype regulator. We sought to determine if caliber control is maintained in aneurysmal intracranial bifurcations. Three-dimensional rotational angiographic volumes of 159 middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcations (62 aneurysmal) were processed using 3D gradient edge-detection filtering, enabling threshold-insensitive radius measurement. Radius ratio (RR)=r₀(3)/(r₁(3)+r₂(3)) and estimated junction exponent (n) were compared between aneurysmal and non-aneurysmal bifurcations using Student t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum analysis. The results show that non-aneurysmal bifurcations display optimal caliber control with mean RR of 1.05 and median n of 2.84. In contrast, aneurysmal bifurcations had significantly lower RR (0.76, p<.0001) and higher n (4.28, p<.0001). Unexpectedly, 37% of aneurysmal bifurcations revealed a daughter branch larger than its parent vessel, an absolute violation of optimality, not witnessed in non-aneurysmal bifurcations. The aneurysms originated more often off the smaller daughter (52%) vs. larger daughter branch (16%). Aneurysm size was not statistically correlated to RR or n. Aneurysmal males showed higher deviation from VOP. Non-aneurysmal MCA bifurcations contralateral to aneurysmal ones showed optimal caliber control. Aneurysmal bifurcations, in contrast to non-aneurysmal counterparts, disobey the VOP and may exhibit dysregulation in WSS-mediated caliber control. The mechanism of this focal divergence from optimality may underlie aneurysm pathogenesis and requires further study.",Baharoglu MI; Lauric A; Wu C; Hippelheuser J; Malek AM,Bifurcation morphology; Intracranial aneurysm; Middle cerebral artery; Optimal caliber control,2014,Journal of biomechanics,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",R21 HL102685/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; R21HL102685/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,29566209,High Pressure in Virtual Postcoiling Model is a Predictor of Internal Carotid Artery Aneurysm Recurrence After Coiling.,"BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic factors play a crucial role in the recurrence of intracranial aneurysms after coiling. However, the strongest factor for predicting recurrence remains unclear because each risk factor has been investigated and reported separately. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the strongest predictor of recurrence with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). METHODS: Using pretreatment patient-specific 3-dimensional rotational angiography data of 50 internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms (7 recanalized, 43 stable) treated with endovascular coiling, we created a precoiling model and a virtual postcoiling model produced by manually cutting the aneurysm by the flat plane corresponding to the virtual coil surface. We conducted CFD analysis to investigate inflow dynamics in the precoiling model and pressure difference and wall shear stress on the virtual coil surface. The pressure difference was calculated by subtracting average pressure at the proximal ICA from the maximum pressure at the coil surface and dividing by dynamic pressure at the proximal ICA for normalization. We compared hemodynamic parameters in both models between recanalized and stable aneurysms. RESULTS: Compared with stable aneurysms, recanalized aneurysms showed a significantly larger inflow area and higher inflow rate in the precoiling model (P = .016, .028), and higher pressure difference at the coil surface in the postcoiling model (P < .001). The receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed that the area under the curve value for the pressure difference (0.967) was superior to that of other evaluated parameters.

rotating_wall,10769412,"Quantification of plaque volume, shear stress on the endothelium, and mechanical properties of the arterial wall with intravascular ultrasound imaging.","Present intravascular echographic imaging (IVUS) is based on either the mechanically rotated single element catheter or the multi-element phased array catheter principle. In both methods the ultrasonic beam is rotated through 360 degrees and the cross-sectional echo image of plaque and wall structures is visualised. A new development based on intravascular ultrasound is calculation of mechanical properties of the arterial wall. In this so-called elastographic approach, high frequency information obtained at identical positions in the arterial wall is compared under systolic and diastolic pressures. Minute shifts in the echo data indicate local compressibility. It thus becomes possible to indicate areas of high or low strain, which correspond to soft and hard material. Three-dimensional information can be obtained if the position of cross sectional slices is recorded with a pull-back device and slices are united into a 3D image. On the basis of such information it has become possible to view stents in 3D, and with interactive software, to calculate automatically plaque volume. With pull-back information only, the artery is reconstructed as a ""straight pipe"". Only when the biplane X-ray information is combined with the intravascular pull-back echo information can the true 3D reconstruction of the artery be constructed. Given the true geometric lumen information, it becomes possible, under certain assumptions, to derive the luminal fluid dynamics. From this, shear stress values close to the arterial wall can be calculated. Under the assumption that low values for local shear stress are areas prone to restenosis, predictions of endangered areas can be made.",Bom N; de Korte CL; Wentzel JJ; Krams R; Carlier SG; van der Steen AW; Slager CJ; Roelandt JR,,2000,Zeitschrift fur Kardiologie,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

A comparison of the instantaneous velocity fields obtained by particle image velocimetry.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the local hemodynamics and pressure losses of crural bypass anastomoses using instantaneous velocity fields acquired by particle image velocimetry (PIV). METHODS: Silastic models of a Taylor patch, a Miller cuff and a femoro-crural patch prosthesis (FCPP) were attached to a circuit driven by a Berlin Heart, providing a pulsatile flow with an amplitude of 450 to 25 ml/min (mean 200 ml/min). An outflow resistance of 0.5 mmHg/ml/min (peripheral resistance units, PRU) was modeled using small silastic tubes providing a phase shift of -12 degrees between flow and pressure curves. The working fluid consisted of a glycerine/water mixture with a viscosity of 4 mPas. Hollow glass spheres with a mean size of 9-13 microm were used as tracer particles. Instantaneous velocity fields were obtained by means of PIV and shear rates as well as shear stresses were calculated. Triggered by the flowmeter signal, 10 measurements at 100 ms intervals per cardiac cycle were obtained. The pressures were measured on the inflow and at both distal outflows. The resulting mean pressure losses due to flow separation and distal fluid acceleration were calculated. RESULTS: Inside the Taylor patch anastomosis a large flow separation at the hood containing a clockwise rotating vortex was found. Additionally a smaller flow separation at the heel and a flow stagnation zone on the floor of the recipient artery were observed. Conversely, inside the Miller cuff a counterclockwise rotating vortex was seen inside a large heel flow separation. The FCPP also showed typical separation areas at the hood and heel of the anastomosis, although these were smaller compared to the other anastomoses. Inside the FCPP anastomosis no vortex creation was observed throughout the cardiac cycle. The mainstream velocities at the inlet levels were comparable for the three anastomoses. A significant fluid acceleration was present at the antegrade as well as the retrograde outlets of the Taylor and Miller cuff, while the fluid acceleration at the antegrade outflow of the FCPP was small, which was attributed to the end-to-end configuration of the antegrade FCPP leg. The calculated normalized antegrade and retrograde pressure losses for the Taylor form were 0.90 and 0.88, for the Miller cuff 0.89 and 0.86 and for the FCPP 0.94 and 0.86, respectively. The shear stresses inside the flow separations of the three anastomoses were significantly lower than normal wall shear stresses. High shear stress levels were found inside the transition zones between flow separation and high velocity mainstream. CONCLUSIONS: The flow pattern inside cuffed or funnel shaped anastomoses consists of large flow separation zones, which are thought to be associated with intimal hyperplasia development. In addition, fluid accelerations at the distal outlets result in pressure losses, which may contribute to impaired crural perfusion.",Heise M; Schmidt S; Krüger U; Rückert R; Rösler S; Neuhaus P; Settmacher U,,2004,Journal of biomechanics,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

The overall appearance of the profiles was that of a flat transitional flow with a slight skewness. The highest velocity was found nearer to the posterior and left vessel wall. The skewness started during top systole and persisted to the beginning of diastole. Furthermore, many small velocity fluctuations were seen during top systole, but they might also be caused by secondary rotational flow phenomena.

Moreover, ultrasound characterization of atherosclerotic plaque subtypes may have important implications in determining the natural history and the clinical outcome of patients with coronary artery disease. The reliability of intravascular ultrasound to differentiate plaque morphology subtypes was studied in 60 coronary segments excised from 33 coronary arteries obtained from 17 patients at necropsy. Ultrasound was performed with a 25-MHz transducer mounted on the distal end of a rigid probe that was rotated manually inside the lumen artery. Plane film radiography was also performed to establish the presence of calcific deposits. A total of 82 histologic transverse sections corresponding to 82 ultrasound imaging sites were studied from the 60 coronary segments. Of the first 54 images, 36 were fibrous plaques and yielded dense homogenous echo reflections, 6 had discrete areas of lipid that were less echogenic and 12 had calcific deposits that cast echo-free shadows beyond areas of intense echo reflections. The predictive accuracy of evaluating plaque composition in the remaining 28 ultrasound imaging sites was 96%. Thus, anatomical structure of coronary arteries and composition of atherosclerotic lesions can be assessed accurately with intravascular ultrasound and may have potential for better understanding of the atherosclerotic process and provide guidance to interventional procedures.",Bartorelli AL; Potkin BN; Almagor Y; Keren G; Roberts WC; Leon MB,,1990,"Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)",Journal Article,,

The fabrication of small diameter vascular scaffolds (SDVSs) mimicking the properties of native blood vessels has been a challenge. Herein, we propose a facile method to fabricate thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/polycaprolactone (PCL) hybrid SDVSs via electrospinning using a modified rotating collector. By varying the ratio between the TPU and the PCL, and changing the electrospinning volume, SDVSs with a wavy configuration and different properties could be obtained. Detailed investigation revealed that certain TPU/PCL hybrid SDVSs closely resembled the mechanical behaviors of blood vessels due to the presence of a wavy region and the combination of flexible TPU and rigid PCL, which mimicked the properties of elastin and collagen in blood vessels. The fabricated TPU/PCL SDVSs achieved lumen diameters of 1-3mm, wall thicknesses of 100-570µm, circumferential moduli of 1-6MPa, ultimate strengths of 2-8MPa, over 250% elongation-at-break values, toe regions of 5.3-9.4%, high recoverability, and compliances close to those of human veins. Moreover, these TPU/PCL SDVSs possessed sufficient suture retention strength and burst pressure to fulfill transplantation requirements and maintain normal blood flow. Human endothelial cell culture revealed good biocompatibility of the scaffolds, and cells were able to grow on the inner surface of the tubular scaffolds, indicating promising prospects for use as tissue-engineered vascular grafts.",Mi HY; Jing X; Yu E; Wang X; Li Q; Turng LS,Mechanical property; Microstructure; Polycaprolactone; Small diameter vascular scaffold; Thermoplastic polyurethane,2018,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",U01 HL134655/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,

Specifically, attention is focused on the rotary culture system, because this technique has proven to be the most practical solution for providing a suitable culture environment supporting three-dimensional tissue assemblies. From a numerical point of view, the growing biological specimen gives rise to a moving boundary problem. A ""volume-of-fraction"" method is specifically and carefully developed according to the complex properties and mechanisms of organic tissue growth and, in particular, taking into account the sensitivity of the construct/liquid interface to the effect of the fluid-dynamic shear stress (it induces changes in tissue metabolism and function that elicit a physiological response from the biological cells). The present study uses available data to introduce a set of growth models. The surface conditions are coupled to the transfer of mass and momentum at the specimen/culture-medium interface and lead to the introduction of a group of differential equations for the nutrient concentration around the sample and for the evolution of tissue mass displacement. The models are then used to show how the proposed surface kinetic laws can predict (through sophisticated numerical simulations) many of the known characteristics of biological tissues grown using rotating-wall perfused vessel bioreactors. This procedure provides a validation of the models and associated numerical method and also gives insight into the mechanisms of the phenomena. The interplay between the increasing size of the tissue and the structure of the convective field is investigated. It is shown that this interaction is essential in determining the time evolution of the tissue shape. The size of the growing specimen plays a critical role with regard to the intensity of convection and the related shear stresses. Convective effects, in turn, are found to impact growth rates, tissue size, and morphology, as well as the mechanisms driving growth.

Aneurysms were occluded with latex or silicone balloons on each side and observed angiographically from 2 weeks to 2 months. A histopathological study was performed subsequently using light and scanning electron microscopy. Rupture after balloon embolization occurred in five aneurysms; all of which were incompletely occluded by a silicone balloon. On subsequent angiograms, four silicone balloons and one latex balloon were found to have migrated into the aneurysm, resulting in aneurysmal expansion. Parent artery occlusion was more common with latex balloons than silicone balloons. Histopathologically, residual fresh thrombi, decreased proliferation of fibroblasts within the aneurysmal cavity, and poor endothelialization were present around the silicone balloon. These results suggest that the intra-aneurysmal organization, as seen in the aneurysm occluded by the silicone balloon, will be delayed because the balloon is not fixed within the aneurysm, and that this free-floating and rotating balloon causes repeated trauma to the aneurysm wall, contributing to subsequent enlargement and rupture of the aneurysm. The superior antithrombogenic nature of silicone may be responsible for the bias of such phenomena toward the silicone balloon.",Miyachi S; Negoro M; Handa T; Terashima K; Keino H; Sugita K,,1992,Neurosurgery,Comparative Study; Journal Article,,

However, the mechanisms responsible for this functional adaptation are not known and the influence of aerobic fitness on LV mechanics during dynamic exercise has never been studied. We assessed LV mechanics, LV wall thickness and dimensions, central augmentation index (AIx), aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), blood pressure and heart rate in 28 males (age: 21±2 years SD) with a consistent physical activity level (no change>6 months). Individuals were examined at rest and during exercise (40% peak exercise capacity) and separated post hoc into a moderate and high aerobic fitness group (˙V(O2peak): 49 ± 5 and 63 ± 7ml kg−1 min−1, respectively, P <0.0001).

Indeed, a number of studies have indicated that gravity affects mammalian cell growth and differentiation through the modulation of gene expression. We have characterized the behaviour of endothelial cells and of the human monocytic cell line U937 cultured in the NASA-developed bioreactor to simulate microgravity, the Rotating Wall Vessels (RWV). In simulated microgravity endothelial cells showed a different behavior which was dependent from the species and from the district of origin, while U937 in the RWV proliferated slower than the controls. All the effects we observed were promptly reversible upon return to normal culture conditions. It is noteworthy that all the cells which maintained the capability to proliferate in microgravity upregulated the stress protein HSP70. We therefore propose that only the cells which sense microgravity as a stressful condition and, consequently, overexpress HSP70 maintain their proliferative potential in simulated microgravity.",Cotrupi S; Maier JA,,2004,Journal of gravitational physiology : a journal of the International Society for,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 26 human fetuses between 20 and 40 weeks' gestation were examined by morphological methods. The umbilical vein, DV and the portal vein were obtained after termination of gestation. Tissue samples have been fixed in phormaldehyde solution (pH 7,2) and were embedded in paraffin. The paraffin sections (5-7 micro k) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, silver impregnation by Bilchovski, orcein, pikrofuchsin. Measurement of the angle between ductus venosus and the portal vein was obtained with alidade. RESULTS: Anatomical scheme of the region of umbilical vein, umbilical sinus and DV indicating two different patterns. The first: DV has situated into line with umbilical vein (22 cases). The second: umbilical vein has rotated before umbilical sinus, forming the turn in right (4 cases). The double-layer wall of ductus venosus (DV) contained the elastic, collagen and argyrophilic fibers. Around isthmus region of DV vasa vasorum and nervi vasorum have been found. The specific anatomical finding of the ductal isthmus was an accumulation of smooth muscle cells as intimal pillow, which were protruded into the vascular lumen. The double-layer wall of portal sinus (intima and adventitia) have been as the internal elastic membrane. The smooth muscle cells have been revealed in the walls, were not formed the tunica media at term 20-40 weeks of gestation. By the contrast the umbilical vein showed multiple, circularly running smooth muscle bundles. In this study, the ductal thickness was consistently bigger in the inlet than in the outlet. The tunica adventitia was greatest in the junction with the portal sinus and the inferior vena cava compared with the part arranged in the liver parenchyma. The wall thickness of the portal sinus and of the umbilical vein was significantly higher than of the duclal wall. CONCLUSION: The vascular muscle-elastic cells of intimal hyperplasia (""intimal pillow"") in wall of DV, probably, executes the role of the fortification of resistant behaviours of vessel wall in connection with DV and portal sinus with high hemodynamics load in this area.

We employed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to study pulsatile flow in these shunts, with the goal to identify haemodynamic characteristics conducive to thrombus formation. METHODS: CFD, using the finite volume method with cardiac catheterization data, and computer simulations, based on angiography, were employed to determine flow-velocity field, wall shear stress (WSS) profile and oscillatory shear index (OSI). RESULTS: At prominent angulation, in central shunts (4 and 3.5 mm), WSS reached 245 and 123 (Pascal-Pa), peak systole and 137 and 46 Pa, end diastole; and, in Sano shunts (5 and 6 mm), WSS attained 203 and 133 Pa, peak systole and 1.6 and 1.5 Pa, end diastole. Counter-rotating flow vortices augmented WSS. These high WSSs can promote platelet aggregation, leading to thrombus formation. The OSIs averaged 0.39, indicative of multidirectional shearing forces. Shunt burden was assessed by averaging WSS, over its luminal area and the cardiac cycle. For the central shunts, these WSSs were 73.0 and 67.2 Pa; whereas, for the Sano shunts, 34.9 and 19.6 Pa. For modified Blalock-Taussig shunts (4 and 3.5 mm), the averaged WSSs were significantly lower at 26.0 and 27.5 Pa, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CFD modelling is an important tool to determine blood flow behaviour in shunts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six type B2 and C lesions in 24 patients (pts) (8 female, 16 male, age 37-80 years) were treated with coronary rotational ablation and complementary PTCA between January 1993 and December 1994 (4.7% of all interventional coronary procedures performed in this period in our laboratory). Eleven pts had stable effort angina and 13 pts had unstable, class IB, IIB, and IIC, angina. The treated vessel was the LAD in 15 cases, CX in 5, RCA in 5, and an intermediate branch in one case. Coronary rotational ablation was proposed because of the presence of two or more risk factors for uneffective or complicated PTCA: eccentricity, calcified lesions, bifurcation stenosis, lesion length > 10 mm, severe stenosis (90-99%), ostial location and bend location (45-60 degrees). No lesion showed coronary thrombus, considered as absolute contraindication to coronary rotational ablation. We used small burrs (burr/artery ratio < 0.75), and complementary PTCA was performed using low inflation pressure (< 8 atm) and long balloons for long lesions (> 10 mm) in order to minimize the risk of dissection. RESULTS: Coronary rotational ablation was successfully performed in all but two cases (24/26; 92.3%), with a reduction of the stenosis from 88 +/- 9% to 45 +/- 10% (range 30-60%). In two pts (7.7%) the procedure was complicated by acute occlusion: both pts underwent effective salvage PTCA with 30% residual stenosis. Small type A and B dissections occurred in 4/26 cases (15.4%). All but one lesions complicated by acute occlusion or dissection following coronary rotational ablation were not or only slightly calcified. Complementary PTCA was performed in all but two pts who already presented 30% residual stenosis after rotational ablation. A further reduction of stenosis to 20 +/- 9% (range 5-30%) was achieved. After complementary PTCA four pts (15.4%) developed type A and B dissections; in one of these a Palmaz-Schatz stent was implanted, whereas the remaining three pts presented a residual stenosis below 30% and no further procedures were undertaken. Overall success rate of rotational atherectomy plus salvage or complementary PTCA or stenting was 100%, and no major complications (Q-wave myocardial infarction, emergency bypass surgery or death) occurred. Three pts showed delayed coronary run-off (slow reflow) after rotational ablation, and two of these released a small amount of cardiac specific enzymes (CK MB) without ECG changes and wall motion alteration on echocardiographic examination. Clinical restenosis, defined as recurrent angina and/or positive exercise stress test, developed in 45.8% (11 pts); in all these pts restenosis was angiographically evidenced (75-99%). CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that coronary rotational ablation along with complementary PTCA using low inflation pressure and long balloons is safe and effective in type B2 and C lesions if calcifications are present; however, restenosis rate remains high.",Isabella G; Ramondo A; Cardaioli P; Reimers B; Pasquetto G; Carasi M; Razzolini R; Chioin R,,1995,Giornale italiano di cardiologia,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,15173626,Morphological changes in woody stem of Prunus jamasakura under simulated microgravity.,"When the four-week-old woody stem of Prunus jamasakura was grown under simulated microgravity condition on a three-dimensional clinostat, it bent at growth, and width of its secondary xylem decreased due to the reduction of fiber cell numbers and a smaller microfibril angle in the secondary cell wall, as reported in our previous paper. Gravity induces the development of the secondary xylem that supports the stem upward against the action of gravity. In this study, morphological changes of the tissues and cells were microscopically observed. Disorder was found in the concentric structure of tissues that organize the stem. The radial arrangement of the cells was also disturbed in the secondary xylem, and in the secondary phloem secondary cell walls of the bast fiber cells were undeveloped. These findings suggest that differentiation and development of the secondary xylem and the bast fiber cells are strongly controlled by terrestrial gravity. These tissue and cells functions to support the stem under the action of gravity. Furthermore, clinorotation induced disorder in the straight joint of vessel elements and the lattice-like structure of radial parenchyma cells, which is responsible for water transportation and storage, respectively. Gravity is an essential factor for keeping the division and differentiation normal in woody stem.",Yoneyama E; Ishimoto-Negishi Y; Sano Y; Funada R; Yamada M; Nakamura T,,2004,Uchu Seibutsu Kagaku,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,23661621,Acute right ventricular pressure overload compromises left ventricular function by altering septal strain and rotation.,"While right ventricular (RV) dysfunction has long been known to affect the performance of left ventricle (LV), the mechanisms remain poorly defined. Recently, speckle-tracking echocardiography has demonstrated that preservation of strain and rotational dynamics is crucial to both LV systolic and diastolic function. We hypothesized that alteration in septal strain and rotational dynamics of the LV occurs during acute RV pressure overload (RVPO) and leads to decreased cardiac performance. Seven anesthetized pigs underwent median sternotomy and placement of intraventricular pressure-volume conductance catheters. Two-dimensional echocardiographic images and LV pressure-volume loops were acquired for offline analysis at baseline and after banding of the pulmonary artery to achieve RVPO (>50 mmHg) induced RV dysfunction. RVPO resulted in a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in LV end-systolic elastance (50%), systolic change in pressure over change in time (19%), end-diastolic volume (22%), and cardiac output (37%) that correlated with decrease in LV global circumferential strain (58%), LV apical rotation (28%), peak untwisting (reverse rotation) rate (27%), and prolonged time to peak rotation (17%), while basal rotation was not significantly altered. RVPO reduced septal radial and circumferential strain, while no other segment of the LV midpapillary wall was affected. RVPO decreased septal radial strain on LV side by 27% and induced a negative radial strain from 28 ± 5 to -16 ± 2% on the RV side of the septum. The septal circumferential strain on both LV and RV side decreased by 46 and 50%, respectively, following RVPO (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that acute RVPO impairs LV performance by primarily altering septal strain and apical rotation.",Chua J; Zhou W; Ho JK; Patel NA; Mackensen GB; Mahajan A,pulmonary aortic banding; right ventricular failure; septal strain,2013,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",R01-HL084261/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,24801899,Novel active fixation mechanism permits precise placement of a left ventricular lead: early results from a multicenter clinical study.,"BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) lead implantation for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is associated with lead dislodgement rates ranging from 3% to 10%, and some implant approaches to prevent dislodgement may contribute to suboptimal CRT response. We report our early human experience with an LV lead with a side helix for active fixation to the coronary vein wall. OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility and safety of the Model 20066 LV lead and to evaluate the implant procedure. METHODS: The Model 20066 is a 4-F bipolar steroid eluting lead that has a small exposed side helix and can be delivered using a guidewire or stylet. At the desired vein location, the lead body is rotated clockwise until the helix is fixated. This study was a single-arm, prospective, nonrandomized trial that enrolled 40 patients from 4 centers who met standard indications for CRT. RESULTS: The lead was successfully implanted in 39 of 40 (98%) patients. In 38 of 40 (95%) patients, the implanters were successful at implanting at a predetermined target site. There were no Model 20066 LV lead dislodgements reported within 12 months of follow-up. The electrical performance of the tip and ring electrodes was stable through the 12-month follow-up visit and similar to other LV leads. Overall lead handling was rated as acceptable for all implants. CONCLUSION: This new LV lead specifically designed with an active fixation mechanism for stability and precise placement was successfully and safely deployed in the coronary vasculature. reserved.",Yee R; Gadler F; Hussin A; Bin Omar R; Khaykin Y; Verma A; Lazeroms M; Hine DS; Marquard KR,Active fixation; Biventricular pacing; LV lead; Lead dislodgement; Left ventricle,2014,Heart rhythm,Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Multicenter Study,,
rotating_wall,8758635,Anterior facial nerve rerouting in cranial base surgery: a comparison of three techniques.,"Anterior rerouting of the facial nerve is a maneuver designed to enhance exposure of the jugular foramen and carotid canal during resection of cranial base tumors. Our clinical impression is that the degree of additional exposure afforded by moving the facial nerve varies considerably according to both anatomic variations and the technique used. Three possible techniques exist based on the extent of facial nerve mobilization and point of rotation: canal wall up-second genu pivot point (CWU-2G); canal wall down-second genu pivot point (CWD-2G); and canal wall down-first genu pivot point (CWD-IG). We anatomically studied 20 human cadaver heads to establish clinically relevant guidelines for the selective use of these techniques. At the level of the dome of the jugular bulb, the facial nerve mobilized anteriorly a mean of 4.2 mm for CWU-2G, 10 mm for CWD-2G, and 14 mm for CWD-1G. Detailed analysis of numerous measurements and rotation angles suggests that the typical exposure afforded by the various rerouting techniques is as follows: CWU-2G, complete exposure of the jugular bulb; CWD-2G, exposure of the jugular bulb and a mean of 6 mm of the posterior aspect of the carotid artery; and CWD-IG, exposure of the jugular bulb and entire carotid genu. Minimizing the amount of facial nerve manipulation needed to achieve sufficient surgical exposure helps optimize postoperative functional status.",Von Doersten PG; Jackler RK,,1996,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of,Comparative Study; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,12722494,Characteristics of microembolic signals detected near their origins in middle cerebral artery stenoses.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Usually, microembolic signal (MES) monitoring is performed for MESs arising from downstream sources. The aim of this study is to describe the special characteristics of MESs originating from nearby sources in the middle cerebral artery (MCA). METHODS: We analyzed 265 MESs detected in 5 patients (the study group) who had acute ischemic strokes within the territory of MCA stenoses and 48 MESs detected in 7 patients (the control group) from proximal sources: severe internal carotid artery stenoses and prosthetic heart valves. MESs were recorded with a 2-MHz, bigate transducer. We performed offline analyses of the recorded MESs using both post-fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectra and pre-FFT time domain signals. MESs were divided into 3 types--focused-frequency signals (FFSs), bottom-frequency signals (BFSs), and multifrequency signals (MFSs)--according to the frequencies of the signals displayed on the post-FFT spectra. RESULTS: In the study group, among 265 MESs, 245 (92.5%) were MFSs, 11 (4.2%) were FFSs, and 9 (3.4%) were BFSs. In the control group, among 48 MESs, 45 (93.5%) were FFSs, 2 (4.2%) were MFSs, and 1 (2.%) was a BFS. There was significant difference in MES type between MCA stenoses and other embolic sources (P < .05). On the post-FFT spectra, MFSs recorded from MCA stenoses occupied multiple frequencies along the vertical axis, and the low-frequency parts were usually bidirectional. On the pre-FFT time domain signals, the highest frequency parts presented distorted, amplitude-modulated sine waves, and the low-frequency parts presented totally irregular waves. The amplitudes of the low-frequency parts diminished with time in the proximal channel but enlarged with time in the distal channel over a short period. CONCLUSION: MESs recorded from MCA stenoses may have special characteristics of multiple frequencies on both post-FFT spectra and pre-FFT time domain signals. Our findings may represent rotating or vibrating emboli as they are just dislodged from the thrombus and are moving from the vessel wall to the center. Further clinical and laboratory studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",Gao S; Wong KS,,2003,Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,23143389,Effect of head posture on the healthy human carotid bifurcation hemodynamics.,"Head and neck postures may cause morphology changes to the geometry of the carotid bifurcation (CB) that alter the low and oscillating wall shear stress (WSS) regions previously reported as important in the development of atherosclerosis. Here the right and left CB were imaged by MRI in two healthy subjects in the neutral head posture with the subject in the supine position and in two other head postures with the subject in the prone position: (1) rightward rotation up to 80°, and (2) leftward rotation up to 80°. Image-based computational models were constructed to investigate the effect of posture on arterial geometry and local hemodynamics. The area exposure to unfavorable hemodynamics, based on thresholds set for oscillatory shear index (OSI), WSS and relative residence time, was used to quantify the hemodynamic impact on the wall. Torsion of the head was found to: (1) cause notable changes in the bifurcation and internal carotid artery angles and, in most cases, on cross-sectional area ratios for common, internal and external carotid artery, (2) change the spatial distribution of wall regions exposed to unfavorable hemodynamics, and (3) cause a marked change in the hemodynamic burden on the wall when the OSI was considered. These findings suggest that head posture may be associated with the genesis and development of atherosclerotic disease as well as complications in stenotic and stented vessels.",Papaharilaou Y; Aristokleous N; Seimenis I; Khozeymeh MI; Georgiou GC; Brott BC; Eracleous E; Anayiotos AS,,2013,Medical & biological engineering & computing,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,16081181,Flow modelling within a scaffold under the influence of uni-axial and bi-axial bioreactor rotation.,"The problem of donor scarcity has led to the recent development of tissue engineering technologies, which aim to create implantable tissue equivalents for clinical transplantation. These replacement tissues are being realised through the use of biodegradable polymer scaffolds; temporary/permanent substrates, which facilitate cell attachment, proliferation, retention and differentiated tissue function. To optimise gas transfer and nutrient delivery, as well as to mimic the fluid dynamic environment present within the body, a dynamic system might be chosen. Experiments have shown that dynamic systems enhance tissue growth, with the aid of scaffolds, as compared to static culture systems. Very often, tissue growth within scaffolds is only seen to occur at the periphery. The present study utilises the Computational Fluid Dynamics package FLUENT, to provide a better understanding of the flow phenomena in scaffolds, within our novel bioreactor system. The uni-axial and bi-axial rotational schemes are studied and compared, based on a vessel rotating speed of 35 rpm. The wall shear stresses within and without the constructs are also studied. Findings show that bi-axial rotation of the vessel results in manifold increases of fluid velocity within the constructs, relative to uni-axial rotation about the X- and Z-axes, respectively.",Singh H; Teoh SH; Low HT; Hutmacher DW,,2005,Journal of biotechnology,Journal Article,,

The temporal and spatial variations in wall shear stress (WSS) within the aneurysmal sac are hypothesized to be correlated with the growth and rupture of the aneurysm. The current work describes the blood flow dynamics in 34 patient-specific models of saccular aneurysms located in the region of the anterior and posterior circulation of the circle of Willis. The models were obtained from three-dimensional rotational angiography image data and blood flow dynamics was studied under a physiologically representative waveform of inflow. The three-dimensional continuity and momentum equations for unsteady laminar flow were solved with commercial software using non-structured fine grid sizes. The vortex structure, the wall pressure, and the WSS showed large variations, depending on the morphology of the artery, size of the aneurysm, and form. A correlation existed between the mean WSS on the aneurysmal sac for lateral unruptured and ruptured aneurysms with an aneurysm surface index, which is defined as the ratio between the aneurysm area and the artery area at model inlet, respectively.",Valencia A; Morales H; Rivera R; Bravo E; Galvez M,,2008,Medical engineering & physics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

rotating_wall,7944034,Forward-looking intravascular ultrasonography: in vitro imaging of normal and atherosclerotic human arteries.,"Inadequate guidance of angioplasty devices limits the endoluminal treatment of high grade atherosclerotic stenoses and total occlusions. Conventional intraluminal ultrasound systems (IVUS) enable lateral cross-sectional imaging of tomographic sections of the vessel wall, but do not offer imaging in front of the catheter. This study describes our initial experience with a forward-looking intravascular ultrasound (FL-IVUS) system (Echoeye, EchoCath, Inc., Princeton, NJ). The acoustic beam from a 25.5 MHz piezoelectric transducer on a 7.5 Fr catheter is mechanically rotated in a forward-looking spiral fashion at 300 cycles/second. Sixty-four axially aligned, cross-sectional, real time images are obtained from a truncated, 60 degree conical volume located 5 to 10 mm from the catheter tip. Luminal dimensions (n = 51) of human cadaveric femoral arteries (cast in agar and submerged in saline) measured by the FL-IVUS were compared to histologic cross-sections of the vessel with a correlation of r = 0.92. FL-IVUS accurately imaged the narrowing lumen in front of total occlusions and the geometry at vessel branches, and identified the location of lesions and the shape and morphology of vessel wall thickness. The 7.5 Fr FL-IVUS over-estimated luminal dimensions in vessels larger than 5 mm. We conclude that FL-IVUS imaging shows promise as a new, accurate method for identifying and characterizing high grade atherosclerotic stenoses and total occlusions, and expands the current capabilities of conventional IVUS systems.",Back MR; Kopchok GE; White RA; Scoccianti M; Donayre CE; Maeuser H; Brener B,,1994,The American surgeon,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,28155672,The study on hemodynamic effect of series type LVAD on aortic blood flow pattern: a primary numerical study.,"BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) has become an alternative treatment for end-stage heart failure patients. Series type of LVAD, as a novel LVAD, has attracted more and more attention. The hemodynamic effects of series type LVAD on aortic blood pattern are considered as its important characteristics; however, the precise mechanism of it is still unclear. METHODS: To clarify the hemodynamic effects of series type LVAD on aortic blood flow pattern, a comparative study on the aortic blood flow pattern and hemodynamic states were carried out numerically for two cases, including series type LVAD support and normal condition. The steady-state computational fluid dynamic (CFD) approach was employed. The blood flow streamline, blood velocity vector and distribution of wall shear stress (WSS) were calculated to evaluate the differences of hemodynamic effects between both conditions. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the aortic flow pattern under series type LVAD showed significant different from that of normal condition. The strength of aortic swirling flow was significantly enhanced by the series type LVAD support. Meanwhile, the rotating direction of swirling flow under LVAD support was also dominated by the rotating direction of series type LVAD. Moreover, the blood velocity and WSS under LVAD support were also significantly enhanced, compared with that under normal condition. CONCLUSION: The hemodynamic states, including the aortic swirling flow characteristic, was significantly dominated by LVAD support. Present investigation could provide not only a useful information on the vascular complications caused by LVAD support, but also provide a useful guide for optimal the structure of the series type LVAD.",Zhang Q; Gao B; Chang Y,Aorta; Blood flow pattern; Series type LVAD; Swirling flow; Wall shear stress,2016,Biomedical engineering online,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,7571784,[Alternative methods in interventional therapy of coronary heart disease].,"Percutaneous high-frequency coronary rotablation using the rotablator is able to remove arteriosclerotic material from the vessel wall. A diamond-coated (30-80 microns) brass burr drill fastened to a flexible drive shaft rotating and tracking along a drill coaxial guide wire is used. The turbine rotates the drive shaft in excess of 150,000-190,000 rpm. High-frequency rotational angioplasty was successful in > 90% of patients, but in about 90% additional PTCA is necessary. No increase of bypass surgery compared to PTCA is observed. CK and CR-MB elevation is more often found than after PTCA. Vessel perforation is rarely observed. All vessels were open at 24-h control. The restenosis rate seems not be increased. The main indications for high-frequency rotational angioplasty are rigid and calcified sclerotic lesions which cannot be passed by conventional balloon catheters. Whether the restenosis rate can be reduced by this method will be judged in part by the COBRA study. In order to avoid acute complications of PTCA and to reduce restenosis rate, coronary stents were developed. Self-expandable and balloon expandable stents are available. It could be demonstrated that these stents can be used as a bail-out system and can block elastic recoil of coronary arteries. The major remaining problem is subacute closure of coronary vessels. In order to prevent thrombosis treatment with coumarine, acetylsalicylic acid, and dipyridamol is necessary. Coronary stents can be successfully delivered in more than 90% of the patients. In a highly selected patient group using single stents restenosis rate could be significantly reduced.",Erbel R; Ge J; Haude M; Görge G,,1995,Zeitschrift fur Kardiologie,Comparative Study; Journal Article; Review,,

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the immediate and delayed effects of Y-stenting using self-expanding microstents on basilar bifurcation architecture and hemodynamics. METHODS: Fifteen patients underwent basilar Y-stent coiling and imaging with rotational angiography. Vascular angles were measured between proximal P1 segments of the posterior cerebral arteries (α) and between the basilar artery and each P1 segment (β(1,2)) in the anteroposterior and γ(1,2) sagittal planes. Patient-specific computational fluid dynamic analysis was used to estimate wall shear stress (WSS) changes with treatment. RESULTS: In the anteroposterior plane, Y-stenting significantly decreased angle α and increased β angles immediately after stent coiling (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively) in a continued dynamic remodeling that progressed further in later months; sagittal γ angles also decreased (P < .0001). This novel stent-induced geometric progressive remodeling resulted in effective straightening and narrowing of the basilar bifurcation angle α (150.0 degrees vs 113 degrees, P < .0001) with significant correlation (r = 0.39, P < .05) between pretreatment proximal P1 angles and maximal angular change. Computational fluid dynamic analysis showed the angular remodeling led to significant narrowing of the WSS interpeak at the apex, redirecting high WSS away from the neck transition zone with native vessel toward the inert coil mass. CONCLUSION: Y-configuration stent coiling induced immediate and, more significantly, a previously undefined delayed cerebrovascular remodeling. This progressive stent-induced angular remodeling alters perianeurysmal hemodynamics, independent of the flow-diverting properties of stent struts, thus shifting the balance of hemodynamic forces affecting aneurysm development and evolution.",Gao B; Baharoglu MI; Cohen AD; Malek AM,,2013,Neurosurgery,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",R21HL102685/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,

SWE has been applied to bulk tissues, but in arteries it is still under investigation. Previously performed studies in arteries or arterial phantoms demonstrated the potential of SWE to measure arterial wall stiffness-a relevant marker in prediction of cardiovascular diseases. This study is focused on numerical modelling of SWs in ex vivo equine aortic tissue, yet based on experimental SWE measurements with the tissue dynamically loaded while rotating the US probe to investigate the sensitivity of SWE to the anisotropic structure. A good match with experimental shear wave group speed results was obtained. SWs were sensitive to the orthotropy and nonlinearity of the material. The model also allowed to study the nature of the SWs by performing 2D FFT-based and analytical phase analyses. A good match between numerical group velocities derived using the time-of-flight algorithm and derived from the dispersion curves was found in the cross-sectional and axial arterial views.

rotating_wall,20815643,Sensitivity of CFD based hemodynamic results in rabbit aneurysm models to idealizations in surrounding vasculature.,"Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies provide a valuable tool for evaluating the role of hemodynamics in vascular diseases such as cerebral aneurysms and atherosclerosis. However, such models necessarily only include isolated segments of the vasculature. In this work, we evaluate the influence of geometric approximations in vascular anatomy on hemodynamics in elastase induced saccular aneurysms in rabbits. One representative high aspect ratio (AR-height/neck width) aneurysm and one low AR aneurysm were created at the origin of the right common carotid artery in two New Zealand white rabbits. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the aneurysm and surrounding arteries were created using 3D rotational angiographic data. Five models with varying extents of neighboring vasculature were created for both the high and low AR cases. A reference model included the aneurysm sac, left common carotid artery (LCCA), aortic arch, and downstream trifurcation/quadrification. Three-dimensional, pulsatile CFD studies were performed and streamlines, wall shear stress (WSS), oscillatory shear index, and cross sectional velocity were compared between the models. The influence of the vascular domain on intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics varied between the low and high AR cases. For the high AR case, even a simple model including only the aneurysm, a small section of neighboring vasculature, and simple extensions captured the main features of the steamline and WSS distribution predicted by the reference model. However, the WSS distribution in the low AR case was more strongly influenced by the extent of vasculature. In particular, it was necessary to include the downstream quadrification and upstream LCCA to obtain good predictions of WSS. The findings in this work demonstrate the accuracy of CFD results can be compromised if insufficient neighboring vessels are included in studies of hemodynamics in elastase induced rabbit aneurysms. Consideration of aspect ratio, hemodynamic parameters of interest, and acceptable magnitude of error when selecting the vascular domain will increase reliability of the results while decreasing computational time.",Zeng Z; Kallmes DF; Durka MJ; Ding Y; Lewis D; Kadirvel R; Robertson AM,,2010,Journal of biomechanical engineering,"Comparative Study; Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",R01 NS042646/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States; R01 NS042646-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States; NS42646-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States,

We assessed the effects of threshold image intensity differences on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using a simple method of threshold determination. This study included 11 consecutive patients with internal carotid artery aneurysms collected retrospectively between April 2009 and March 2010. In 3-dimensional rotational angiography image data, we set a line probe across the coronal cross-section of the parent internal carotid artery, and calculated a profile curve of the image intensity along this line. We employed the threshold coefficient (C(thre)) value in this profile curve, in order to determine the threshold image intensity objectively. We assessed the effects of C(thre) value differences on vascular model configuration and the wall shear stress (WSS) distribution of the aneurysm. The threshold image intensity increased as the C(thre) value increased. The frequency of manual editing increased as the C(thre) value decreased, while disconnection of the posterior communicating artery occurred more frequently as the C(thre) value increased. The volume of the vascular model decreased and WSS increased according to the C(thre) value increase. The pattern of WSS distribution changed remarkably in one case. Threshold image intensity differences can produce profound effects on CFD. Our results suggest the uniform setting of C(thre) value is important for objective CFD.",Omodaka S; Inoue T; Funamoto K; Sugiyama S; Shimizu H; Hayase T; Takahashi A; Tominaga T,,2012,Journal of biomechanics,Clinical Trial; Journal Article,,

We studied the impact of microgravity on engraftable stem cells, culturing marrow cells in rotary wall vessel (RWV) culture chambers mimicking microgravity and in normal gravity nonadherent Teflon bottles. A quantitative competitive engraftment technique was assessed under both conditions in lethally irradiated hosts. We assessed 8-wk engraftable stem cells over a period spanning at least one cell cycle for cytokine (FLT-3 ligand, thrombopoietin [TPO], steel factor)-activated marrow stem cells. Engraftable stem cells were supported out to 56 h under microgravity conditions, and this support was superior to that seen in normal-gravity Teflon bottle cultures out to 40 h, with Teflon bottle culture support superior to RWV from 40 to 56 h. A nadir of stem cell number was seen at 40 h in Teflon and 48 h in RWV, suggesting altered marrow stem cell cycle kinetics under microgravity.

rotating_wall,2296876,Combined mechanical and chemical thrombolysis in an experimental animal model: evaluation by angiography and angioscopy.,"In an experimental animal model of femoral artery thrombosis, contrast angiography was compared to intravascular angioscopy. Additionally, the effect of mechanical, rotational thrombectomy and the additive benefit of the administration of intravascular streptokinase were assessed by means of both procedures. After external forceps crush injury alone, contrast angiograms were generally normal (6 of 14) or showed minimal luminal irregularity (3 of 14), and 5 of 14 had 30% to 50% stenosis. With angioscopy, none appeared normal, and 14 of 14 showed thrombi layered along the wall, as well as intimal flaps, and 6 of 14 had partially occlusive thrombi (p less than 0.001 angiography vs angioscopy). After 2-hour occlusion and injection of thrombin into the injured segment, angiographic total (5 of 14), subtotal (3 of 14), or partial thrombotic occlusions (5 of 14) were created. Angioscopy showed similar results, except that total occlusions were classed as subtotal occlusions. After rotational thrombectomy, most arteries again appeared normal by contrast angiography (6 of 11) but none were angioscopically normal (p less than 0.006). Streptokinase, administered after rotational thrombectomy in seven arteries, normalized one 30% angiographic stenosis; there were no other angiographic changes. Findings with angioscopy were also unchanged. We conclude that in the diagnosis and treatment of intravascular thrombosis, angioscopy is generally more sensitive in the detection of intravascular thrombi, with the exception of total thrombotic occlusions. Angioscopy was uniquely effective in identifying subintimal flaps, which were never identified by angiography. In this model, streptokinase provided little or no additional thrombolytic benefit to mechanical thrombectomy alone.",Ritchie JL; Hansen DD; Johnson C; Vracko R; Auth DC,,1990,American heart journal,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,

The Omnicarbon prostheses was modified to allow in situ manual rotation of the valve when implanted in the aortic position of eight 90 kg pigs. Pulsed Doppler ultrasound was used to acquire velocity measurements at 17 locations within the cross-sectional area of the ascending aorta. In each animal, 12 valve rotations were tested in this manner. Reynolds normal stresses were estimated from the velocity measurements. High Reynolds normal stresses were concentrated between left and posterior-right sides of the aortic wall for all orientations studied. No trends in mean or maximum Reynolds normal stresses with respect to valve rotation were consistent in the experiments. Unlike previous experiments with the Medtronic-Hall tilting disc valve, these experiments showed no notable changes in Reynolds normal stress with respect to orientation of the Omnicarbon valve. This suggests that the tendency of turbulent stresses to change with tilting disc valve orientation may be dependent on valve design.",Travis BR; Nyboe C; Christensen TD; Smerup M; Johansen P; Nygaard H; Hasenkam JM,,2007,ASAIO journal (American Society for Artificial Internal Organs : 1992),"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,

Wounds of 5 patients were repaired with rotator scapular artery perforator flap (flap area of 8 cm×7 cm to 12 cm×6 cm), and the donor flap area was sutured directly. Wounds of 3 patients were repaired with lateral thoracic perforator flap (flap area of 8 cm×7 cm to 13 cm×9 cm). The donor flap area of two patients was sutured directly, the majority of the donor flap area of one patient was sutured directly, and a small part was covered by split-thickness skin graft from ipsilateral thigh. Wounds of 4 patients were repaired with medial brachial artery perforator flap (flap area of 6 cm×5 cm to 12 cm×10 cm). The donor flap area of two patients was sutured directly, and two patients were covered with split-thickness skin graft from left chest wall. The flaps of 11 patients survived after surgery. Blood flow disorder at the distal end of the flap was observed in one patient. After treatment, the distal end of the flap presented 3 cm×2 cm necrosis, and the skin graft survived after second skin grafting and debridement. During the follow-up of 6 to 24 months post surgery, all patients had good texture of flap, with light scar hyperplasia in the donor flap area, and good recovery of elbow and shoulder joint function.

rotating_wall,12697565,Simulated hypogravity stimulates cell spreading and wound healing in cultured human vascular endothelial cells.,"It is well known that endothelial cells (EC) are highly sensitive to mechanical influences such as hemodynamic conditions or pulsatile stretch. However, it is still unknown, how endothelium responds to the changed gravity. The results of some studies suggest that cellular elements of vascular wall and, particularly, endothelium, may directly participate in development of physiological responces to microgravity. On our suggestion, this is extremely attractive since vascular endothelium is one of the main regulators of vascular tone (via its interaction with vascular smooth muscle cells) and, consequently, can play not last role in maintaining of normal cardiovascular system operation in microgravity. On the other hand, the endothelium itself may be regarded as a widely dispersed organ of approximately 1.5 kg in weight (in the adult human organism). Finally, endothelium is not just a passive barrier between vascular wall and circulating blood but synthesizes, metabolizes, and releases a substances which act on adjacent cell systems or distant cell structures. The main aims of this study were: 1) the development of experimental model, allowing to study functional parameters of human endothelial cells in hypogravity conditions in vitro; 2) the verification of endothelial sensitivity to gravitational micro-environment.",Romanov Y; Kabaeva N; Buravkova L,,2000,Journal of gravitational physiology : a journal of the International Society for,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,20207811,Peak systolic velocity of mitral annular longitudinal movement measured by pulsed tissue Doppler imaging as an index of global left ventricular contractility.,"We sought to test whether the peak systolic velocity of mitral annular longitudinal movement (S') measured by pulsed tissue Doppler imaging technique is useful to assess global left ventricular (LV) contractility under various LV inotropic conditions, including regional wall motion abnormality. In addition, the accuracy of S' relative to LV ejection fraction (EF), a conventional index of LV contractility, and its association with apical rotation, a new index of LV contractility, were also evaluated. We measured S' at the medial mitral annulus and apical rotation in 11 open-chest anesthetized dogs at eight inotropic stages before and after ligation of either the left anterior descending or circumflex coronary artery. Maximal positive dP/dt (dP/dt(peak)) was monitored using a high-fidelity pressure catheter and used as the standard measure of LV contractility. S' showed dose-dependent increases and decreases after dobutamine and esmolol infusion, respectively. There was a stronger association between dP/dt(peak) and S' (R(2) = 0.665, P < 0.001) than between dP/dt(peak) and EF (R(2) = 0.408, P < 0.001), and this trend was more apparent with coronary ligation, regardless of the ligation site. The strength of association between dP/dt(peak) and S' (R(2) = 0.665) was not different from that between dP/dt(peak) and apical rotation (R(2) = 0.726) (P = 0.350). The association between LV EF and S' was modest (R(2) = 0.472, P < 0.001), whereas a good association between S' and apical rotation was observed both with (R(2) = 0.552, P < 0.001) and without (R(2) = 0.674, P < 0.001) coronary ligation.

PCIV rabbit model was established by feeding high-fat diet companied with paravertebral sclerotherapy and rotation exercise. The general observation, step-down test, rheoencephalogram, blood tests, histopathological detection and the plasma concentration of the effective component of XYD were investigated. After pharmacological intervening, the step-down time, REG, PL, IPL, blood viscosity, the levels of blood lipids, CRGP were significantly improved. Moreover, the vertebral artery showed the reduced stenosis of arterial lumen and less proliferation of fibrous tissue in the arterial wall in the LXYD, HXYD and YXQN group. Based on the LC-MS detection, the blood concentrations of puerarin in the LXYD and HXYD group were significantly increased after pharmacological intervening.

rotating_wall,28389927,Post-mortem imaging of the infant and perinatal dura mater and superior sagittal sinus using optical coherence tomography.,"Infants and young children are likely to present with subdural haemorrhage (SDH) if they are the victims of abusive head trauma. In these cases, the most accepted theory for the source of bleeding is the bridging veins traversing from the surface of the brain to the dura mater. However, some have suggested that SDH may result from leakage of blood from a dural vascular plexus. As post-mortem examination of the bridging veins and dura is challenging, and imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance and computed tomography do not have the resolution capabilities to image small blood vessels, we have trialled the use of intravascular and benchtop optical coherence tomography (OCT) systems for imaging from within the superior sagittal sinus (SSS) and through the dura during five infant/perinatal autopsies. Numerous vessel-like structures were identified using both OCT systems. Measurements taken with the intravascular rotational system indicate that the approximate median diameters of blood vessels entering anterior and posterior segments of the SSS were 110 μm (range 70 to 670 μm, n = 21) and 125 μm (range 70 to 740 μm, n = 23), respectively. For blood vessels close to the wall of the SSS, the median diameters for anterior and posterior segments of the SSS were 80 μm (range 40 to 170 μm, n = 25) and 90 μm (range 30 to 150 μm), respectively. Detailed characterisation of the dural vasculature is important to aid understanding of the source of SDH.

METHODS: Sixty-nine patients underwent nonelectrocardiographically gated 16-slice multidetector CT angiography of the pulmonary circulation with a rotation time of 0.5 second (group 1, n = 37) or 0.375 second (group 2, n = 32). All scans were prospectively analyzed for the presence of cardiogenic motion artifacts in the pulmonary arteries, defined as a blurring of the edges of the pulmonary arteries on lung window settings with or without an artifactual loss of enhancement in the arterial lumen on soft tissue windows (""pseudofilling defect""). In addition, the severity of pulmonary arterial blurring was recorded using a 4-point scale. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (81%) had at least 1 pulmonary artery affected by cardiogenic motion artifacts. At the level of the central pulmonary arteries, movement artifacts responsible for a blurring of the arterial wall were present in 35 patients (51%), mainly observed at the level of the pulmonary trunk (n = 28, 41% of patients) and right main pulmonary artery (n = 23, 33% of patients); in 2 patients, motion artifact was responsible for a pseudoflap appearance within the arterial lumen (n = 2, 4% of patients). Motion artifacts at the level of lobar pulmonary arteries were noted only in the lower divisions of the lingula (n = 1, 1.5% of patients) and in the left lower lobe (n = 2, 3% of patients). At the level of the segmental pulmonary arteries, motion artifacts were most frequently found in the lower divisions of the left upper lobe (lingula) (n = 19, 27.5% of patients) and left lower lobe (n = 29, 42% of patients). At the subsegmental level, motion artifacts were most common in the lower divisions of the left upper lobe (lingula) (n = 30, 43.5% of patients) and left lower lobe (n = 35, 51% of patients). Pseudofilling defects were depicted at the segmental and subsegmental levels in 28 patients (41% of the study group), almost exclusively located in the lingula and left lower lobe. Cardiogenic motion artifacts were observed with a significantly lower frequency in group 2 (22 of 32 patients, 69%) than in group 1 (34 of 37 patients, 92%) (P = 0.0142), with a concurrent reduction in the frequency of pseudofilling defects identified in 20 patients (54%) in group 1 and in 8 patients (25%) in group 2 (P = 0.0142). CONCLUSION: The use of a 0.375-second rotation time enables significant reduction in the frequency of cardiogenic motion artifacts on 16-slice multidetector CT angiograms of the pulmonary circulation.",Bruzzi JF; Rémy-Jardin M; Kirsch J; Hennion D; Deken-Delanoy V; Duhamel A; Rémy J,,2005,Journal of computer assisted tomography,Comparative Study; Evaluation Study; Journal Article,,

A 77-year-old male patient had undergone coronary artery bypass surgery 10 years earlier and implantation of a permanent pacemaker 2 years prior. He had presented with typical angina and a regional wall motion defect had been observed on echocardiography. Coronary angiography was scheduled. A 5-F sheath (Terumo Corp., Tokyo, Japan) was inserted, and angiography via the right radial artery was initiated. Soon after, the 5-F diagnostic catheter became twisted due to subclavian artery tortuosity. The fold in the catheter could not be flattened with 0.038-mm or 0.035-mm guidewires or rotation movements. With scopy assistance, a 21-gauge, 40-mm, green needle was inserted percutaneously into the catheter through the brachial artery. So, the catheter was stretched and the kink could then be corrected and the catheter was removed from the sheath. Subsequent Images revealed no trauma or deformity of the brachial or radial arteries. It was not possible to straighten the fold until the distal portion of the catheter was fixed in place and stretched. A catheter can be transdermally anchored with a needle if it becomes kinked in the upper extremity vessels.

rotating_wall,24808222,Impact of head rotation on the individualized common carotid flow and carotid bifurcation hemodynamics.,"This paper aims at evaluating the changes that head rotation poses on morphological and flow characteristics of the carotid bifurcation (CB) and on the distribution of parameters that are regarded as important in atherosclerosis development, such as relative particle residence time (RRT), normalized oscillatory shear index (nOSI), and helicity (HL). Using a subject-specific approach, six healthy volunteers were MR-scanned in two head postures: supine neutral and prone with rightward head rotation. Cross-sectional flow velocity distribution was obtained using phase-contrast MRI at the common carotid artery (CCA). Our results indicate that peak systolic flow rate is reduced at the prone position in most cases for both CCAs. Morphological MR images are used to segment and construct the CB models. Numerical simulations are performed and areas exposed to high helicity or unfavorable hemodynamics are calculated. Head rotation affects the instantaneous spatial extent of high helicity regions. Posture-related observed differences in the distribution of nOSI and RRT suggest that inlet flow waveform tends to moderate geometry-induced changes in the qualitative and quantitative distribution of atherosclerosis-susceptible wall regions. Overall, presented results indicate that an individualized approach is required to fully assess the postural role in atherosclerosis development and in complications arising in stenotic and stented vessels.",Aristokleous N; Seimenis I; Georgiou GC; Papaharilaou Y; Brott BC; Nicolaides A; Anayiotos AS,,2014,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

An anomalous ascending pharyngeal artery (AphA) has been reported to result in incomplete control of the blood flow during CEA. Here, we present a case of symptomatic right internal carotid stenosis for which CEA was performed. An anomalous AphA was confirmed based on its origin from the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) on 3-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA). The anomalous AphA arose near the distal end of the plaque, and the origin of the AphA was located in the dorsal wall of the ICA, hidden from the surgical view. The origin of the AphA was detected with rotation of the ICA within the carotid sheath (CS). Intraoperatively, the blood flow from the AphA was completely controlled with clamping of the origin of the AphA. We emphasize the importance of the 3DRA to detect an anomalous AphA and propose the use of the CS as an anchor to rotate the ICA for optimizing the surgical view behind the ICA. This simple surgical technique facilitates to detect and clamp an anomalous AphA arising from the ICA.",Maki Y; Kurosaki Y; Ishibashi R; Morita T; Chin M; Yamagata S,,2018,Annals of vascular surgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,27731544,Rotation-based technique for the rapid densification of tubular collagen gel scaffolds.,"Type I collagen gel is often used as a tubular scaffold because of its easy molding properties as well as its biocompatibility, low immunogenicity and ability to be remodelled by cells. However, its highly hydrated structure contributes to its weak mechanical properties and reduces its ability to be handled, which is important in tubular tissue engineering. Although cell-driven remodelling of collagen matrices is known to reinforce their mechanical properties, this process can take weeks. This study introduces a novel, simple, and rapid technique using a rotational bioreactor to expel water and densify collagen under sterile conditions to generate denser and stronger collagen gel scaffolds. This process produces a dense tubular-shaped collagen gel which, compared to standard collagen gel scaffolds, shows a decreased wall thickness and a four-fold increase in collagen concentration. A denser collagen fiber network observed by immunofluorescence staining and mechanical characterisation shows a twenty-fold increase in the elastic modulus of the dense constructs which maintain cell viability inside the scaffold. Moreover, by simply modifying the scaffold mold, customised shapes and sizes can be obtained to provide a wide range of applications, including complex tubular geometries and multi-layered scaffolds for the culture of various cell types and tissues.",Loy C; Lainé A; Mantovani D,Collagen; Scaffold; Vascular tissue engineering; Vascular tissue model; Viscoelasticity,2016,Biotechnology journal,Journal Article,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this sequence, central k-space sampling for each slice is required at inversion time (TI) of the blood signal. To fill the entire k-space, the peripheral lines are obtained less or greater the TI and using a rotating slice order. Blood flow signal suppression was first evaluated using a phantom. Simulation studies were used to investigate FSE image quality. The final sequence was then applied to the rabbit abdominal aorta MRI at 4.7 T. RESULTS: In the flow phantom study, artifacts from slow-flowing water were substantially reduced by the KRISP technique; residual water spins were dephased by the strong phase-encoding gradient required for peripheral k-space. These dephased spins flowed into the slice plane where the center of k-space was being acquired at the TI of the flowing water signal. Multislice black-blood MR images were successfully obtained in the rabbit abdomen using the sequence with the k-trajectory optimized by the simulation study.

rotating_wall,5273901,An electromagnetic catheter blood flow meter of minimal lateral dimensions.,"A method is described to reduce the lateral dimensions of an electromagnetic catheter blood flow meter to the maximum possible extent. To achieve this, the magnetic field is generated by a magnet placed outside the subject. Thus, only the electrodes and a minimal supporting structure have to be introduced into the blood vessel to pick up the electromotive force induced in the blood streaming at right angles to the magnetic field. To suppress induction of a transformer electromotive force in the electrode leads, the latter form a co-axial lead system of small gauge. One electrode is at the tip of the insulated external tube of this lead system (a gauge no. 28 hypodermic tube) and is insulated from it. The other electrode is a bare section of the external tube about 2 cm from its tip. The tube is bent at an angle of about 30 degrees just below the second electrode. Thus, this bent section places the two electrodes near two diametrically opposite wall sections of the blood vessels after insertion of the fine catheter via a hollow catheter through a branch blood vessel into the main vessel. The catheter is rotated until the plane containing the bent section is perpendicular to the magnetic field. The potential difference between the two electrodes measures the volume rate of flow through the blood vessel. This principle can be used to monitor the flow in the major blood vessels as well as in their branches. Catheter flow meters down to about 0.5 mm in external diameter have thus been made and much smaller ones can be made without excessive difficulty.",Kolin A,,1970,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Journal Article,,

With the aim of creating a confluent endothelium or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular grafts, using a minimum of allo- or xenogenic material, we have investigated the use of human serum for endothelial cell (EC) growth and adhesion to the grafts. Loss of fibronectin from the serum was measured before and after coating. After serum- or collagen I-precoating, the grafts were seeded with cultured adult human endothelial cells from the great saphenous vein and then kept under rotational culture conditions for 2 days. To evaluate the endothelial resistance to detachment the grafts were mounted in parallel to a heart-lung machine, delivering a pulsatile flow of human blood for 1 hour. Evaluation was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). By simply pressing serum through the graft wall, fibronectin corresponding to 19 micrograms/cm2 graft surface was consumed. It was possible to achieve a confluent endothelium on both serum- and collagen I-precoated grafts (n = 8). After being subjected to blood flow, SEM revealed a complete endothelial lining of the grafts (n = 12) except for two serum-precoated grafts which showed < or = 10% and between 10 and 20% denuded areas, and one collagen-coated graft that showed < or = 10% of denuded area.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of angular remodeling in aneurysms treated with single stent-assisted coiling with the use of computational fluid dynamic techniques. METHODS: Fourteen patients (7 women, mean age 55) who underwent stent coiling of 14 wide-necked bifurcation aneurysms were included based on the availability of high-resolution 3-dimensional rotational angiography. Pretreatment data sets underwent virtual aneurysm removal to isolate the effect of stenting. Wall shear stress and pressure profiles obtained from constant flow input computational fluid dynamic analysis were analyzed for apical hemodynamic changes. RESULTS: Stenting increased the bifurcation angle with significant straightening immediately after treatment and at follow-up (107.3° vs. 144.9°, P < .001). The increased stented angle at follow-up led to decreased pressure drop at the bifurcation apex (12.2 vs. 9.9 Pa, P < .003) and migration of the flow impingement zone (FIZ) toward the contralateral nonstented daughter branch by a mean of 1.48 ± 0.2 mm. Stent-induced angular remodeling decreased FIZ width separating peak apical wall shear stress (3.4 vs. 2.5 mm, P < .004). Analysis of FIZ distance measured from the parent vessel centerline showed it to be linearly (r = .58, P < .002) and FIZ width inversely correlated (r = .46, P < .02) to vessel bifurcation angle. CONCLUSION: Stent-induced angular remodeling significantly altered bifurcation apex hemodynamics in a favorable direction by blunting apical pressure and inducing the narrowing and migration of the FIZ, a novel response to intracranial stenting that should be added to intimal hyperplasia and flow diversion.",Gao B; Baharoglu MI; Malek AM,,2013,Neurosurgery,Clinical Trial; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,20471223,Spiral systolic blood flow in the ascending aorta and aortic arch analyzed by echo-dynamography.,"Using echo-dynamography, systolic blood flow structure in the ascending aorta and aortic arch was investigated in 10 healthy volunteers. The blood flow structure was analyzed based on the two-dimensional (2D) and 1D velocity vector distributions, changing acceleration of flow direction (CAFD), vorticity distribution, and Doppler pressure distribution. To justify the results obtained in humans, in vitro experiments were done using straight and curved tube models of 20mm diameter. The distribution of the CAFD showed a spiral staircase pattern along the flow axis line. In addition, the changes in the velocity profile in the short-axis direction, 2D distribution of the vorticity, and velocity vector distribution on the aortic cross-section plane, all confirmed the presence of systolic twisted spiral flow rotating clockwise toward the peripheral part of the ascending aorta. The rotation cycle of this spiral flow correlated inversely with the maximum velocity of the aortic flow, so that this cycle was shorter in early systole and longer in late systole. The model experiments showed similar results. The spiral flow seemed to be produced by several factors: (i) anterior shift of the direction of ejected blood flow due to the anterior displacement of the projection of the aorta; (ii) accelerated high pressure flow ejected antero-upward; (iii) inertia resistance at the peripheral boundary of the sinus of Valsalva; and (iv) reflection caused by the concave spherical structure of the inner surface of the basal part of the aorta. Because the main spiral flow axis line nearly coincided with the center line of the aorta, it is concluded that the occurrence of the spiral flow plays an important role in maintaining the blood flow direction passing through the cylindrical curved aortic arch and thus in keeping the most effective ejection as well as in dispersing the shear stress in the aortic wall. rights reserved.",Tanaka M; Sakamoto T; Sugawara S; Nakajima H; Kameyama T; Katahira Y; Ohtsuki S; Kanai H,,2010,Journal of cardiology,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,22266234,A texture matching method considering geometric transformations in noninvasive ultrasonic measurement of arterial elasticity.,"Measurement of arterial elasticity can provide an important reference for understanding arterial wall changes that may occur in the early stages of atherosclerosis. Conventional correlation-based methods for evaluating arterial wall movements consider only the translation, ignoring the rotation and deformation, which limits the accuracy of measurement of arterial displacement and its biomechanical properties. This article proposes a novel texture matching method based on ultrasonic B-mode image considering geometric transformations to accurately measure arterial displacement and acquire arterial elasticity noninvasively. The method was validated by simulated images with rotation and deformation and further by measurements in vitro arterial phantom and in vivo common carotid arteries of 20 healthy volunteers. Simulation results demonstrate that the method can improve the accuracy of measurement of arterial displacement. Experimental results show that the elastic modulus of the arterial phantom agrees well with the results obtained from mechanical tests, deviating only 4.1%.

rotating_wall,19473135,Flow visualization study of a novel respiratory assist catheter.,"Respiratory assist using intravenous catheters may be a potential therapy for patients with acute and acute-on-chronic lung failure. An important design constraint is respiratory catheter size, and new strategies are needed that enable size reduction while maintaining adequate gas exchange. Our group is currently developing a percutaneous respiratory assist catheter (PRAC) that uses a rotating bundle of hollow fiber membranes to enhance CO(2) removal and O(2) supply with increasing bundle rotation rate. In this study, particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to analyze the fluid flow patterns and velocity fields surrounding the rotating fiber bundle of the PRAC. The goal of the study was to assess the rotational flow patterns within the context of the gas exchange enhancement that occurs with increasing fiber bundle rotation. A PRAC prototype was placed in a 1-in. internal diameter test section of an in vitro flow loop designed specifically for PIV studies. The rotation rate of the PRAC was varied between 500 and 7000 rpm, and PIV was used to determine the velocity fields in the primary (r-theta) and secondary (r-z) flow planes. The secondary flow exhibited time-varying and incoherent vortices that were consistent with the classical Taylor vortices expected for Taylor numbers (Ta) corresponding to the rotation speeds studied (2200 < Ta < 31 000). In the primary flow, the tangential velocity exhibited boundary layers of less than (1/2) mm adjacent to the fiber bundle and vessel wall. The estimated shear stress associated with the Taylor vortices was approximately 11 dyne/cm(2) at 7000 rpm and was over 10 times smaller than the shear stress in the primary flow boundary layers.",Budilarto SG; Frankowski BJ; Hattler BG; Federspiel WJ,,2009,Artificial organs,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL70051/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,21944481,Contained ruptured paravisceral aortic aneurysm related to immunoglobulin G4 aortitis.,"BACKGROUND: To describe a case of autoimmune inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) associated with rupture. METHODS: A 63-year-old woman presented with 5 days of abdominal pain, malaise, fever, and chills after 6 months of debilitating back pain with a 3-kg weight loss. On examination, she was shown to have a tender palpable pulsatile abdominal mass. Computed tomographic angiography revealed a multilobulated paravisceral AAA (5.5 cm in maximal diameter) and bilateral popliteal aneurysms. The appearance of the aneurysms was indicative of primary aortic infection. Laboratory examinations demonstrated a white blood cell (WBC) count of 12.3×10(9)/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 131 mm/hr, normal antinuclear antibody level, and C-reactive protein level of 211 mg/L. Nuclear WBC scan showed no uptake of tracer around the aorta. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Because of the AAA size and symptoms, open repair was expedited. The operation was performed through a transabdominal midline incision with a mediovisceral rotation. Extensive retroperitoneal inflammation extending into the paravisceral aorta was encountered. Supraceliac clamping was possible. The aorta was replaced from the level of the superior mesenteric artery to the aortic bifurcation with a 16-mm rifampin-soaked graft with reimplantation of the left renal artery. Cultures and biopsies were done. RESULTS: Histology demonstrated vessel wall rupture, adventitial fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration, obliterative phlebitis, lymphoid follicles, perineural inflammation, and immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) plasma cell infiltration, consistent with a contained ruptured aneurysm associated with IgG4 periaortitis. The patient had a long postoperative course with prolonged intubation and renal failure requiring hemodialysis, which resolved 8 weeks postoperatively. Immunosuppression was paramount for her improvement. CONCLUSION: IgG4-related inflammatory AAAs are rare; this is the first report of one with a contained rupture. The patient's symptoms, the unusual appearance on computed tomography, the presence of popliteal aneurysms in a woman, and the normal WBC scan were indicative of an inflammatory etiology. Tissue biopsy was critical to obtain histological diagnosis and direct treatment. rights reserved.",Trinidad-Hernandez M; Duncan AA,,2012,Annals of vascular surgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,1508017,Intravascular ultrasound guided holmium:YAG laser recanalization of occluded arteries.,"Current angioplasty devices are limited by arterial wall dissection and perforation, and by early recurrence from inadequate debulking of lesions. This study evaluated intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) as guidance for concentric laser recanalization of arterial occlusions. Twelve, 2-4-cm-long canine iliac artery occlusions were treated at 2 weeks (organizing thrombus) to 12 weeks (firm fibrous lesions) using a Holmium:YAG laser (2,100 nm wavelength) in free running mode, FRM, (250 musec pulse, 5 Hz), n = 9; and Q-switched mode, QSM (200 ns pulse, 6 Hz), n = 3. A 200 microns (n = 2) or 600 microns (n = 10) optic fiber was centered in the artery coaxial to a 5Fr rotating A scan IVUS probe. The fiber was positioned in the center of the artery distal to the lesion and slowly advanced through the obstruction. In 8 occlusions the same fiber was used as a guidewire for passage of either a 1.6-mm-(n = 2) and/or 3.0-mm (n = 6) diameter multifiber catheter (19 x 100 and 19 x 200 microns fibers, respectively) using FRM energy to further debulk the lesion. In all cases, IVUS guidance enabled concentric initial recanalization of occlusions, although 3 vessel perforations resulted from fiber deviation off the center of the lumen at a distance of 2 to 4 cm from the IVUS imaging element. Both QSM and FRM modes ablated tissue, with FRM modes producing more tissue fragmentation and thermal effect. IVUS images accurately diagnosed the location of lesions compared to angioscopic views and pathologic analysis of the specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",White RA; Kopchok GE; Tabbara MR; Cavaye DM; Cormier F,,1992,Lasers in surgery and medicine,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,2991357,Tomographic gated blood pool radionuclide ventriculography: analysis of wall motion and left ventricular volumes in patients with coronary artery disease.,"The use of planar radionuclide ventriculography to evaluate global and segmental ventricular function is limited by the superimposition of structures in some projections and the gross segmental resolution of the planar technique. Preliminary reports have suggested the feasibility of tomographic gated radionuclide ventriculography with rotating detector systems. This study tested the hypotheses that 1) tomographic radionuclide ventriculography detects segmental dysfunction at rest not identified with multiview planar studies and single plane contrast ventriculography, and 2) ventricular volumes and ejection fraction calculated from these studies provide data similar to those obtained with angiography and planar radionuclide ventriculography. Gated blood pool tomograms were acquired over 180 degrees at 15 frames per cardiac cycle during the initial 90% of the cardiac cycle. Compared with the multiview planar technique tomographic ventriculography showed an increased sensitivity for detecting left ventricular segments with significant coronary artery stenosis (97 versus 74%, p less than 0.025) without any loss in specificity. Compared with both planar radionuclide and contrast ventriculography, tomographic radionuclide ventriculography also detected more noninfarcted left ventricular segments supplied by stenosed coronary arteries (81 versus 39 and 32%, respectively, p less than 0.01). Tomographic radionuclide ventriculographic measurements of left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction showed close correlations with angiographic and planar radionuclide determinations. Gated blood pool tomography is a sensitive method for the evaluation of segmental wall motion and an accurate method for the measurement of global left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction.",Corbett JR; Jansen DE; Lewis SE; Gabliani GI; Nicod P; Filipchuk NG; Redish GA; Akers MS; Wolfe CL; Rellas JS; et al.,,1985,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",HL17669/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,22437528,A novel technology for large vessel recanalization.,"Large vessels recanalization is a challenge for mechanical atherectomy devices, where the lumen debulked is close in diameter to the device crossing profile, which may be only 25% to 30% of the original lumen size; so, the procedure can restore only a fraction of the original blood flow. Moreover, small diameter lumens are prone to be repeatedly occluded after a relatively short period of time. In this article, we present a novel technology of recanalization, using a catheter-based microjet system to deliver a flux of biocompatible abrasive particles to the lesion site, resulting in microchipping of the plaque, while minimizing trauma to the vessel wall. Plaque debris is removed from the blood flow, and blood flow is restored. In contrast to rotating mechanical devices, plaque debulking can be performed up to diameters that are substantially larger than the device crossing profile, supporting superior long-term patency. As a case study, we evaluated the technology for use in the superficial femoral artery where the lesions tend to be very long and heavily calcified with high restenosis rates.",Weitzman Y; Ben-Porath A; Levitsky M; Jonas M; Gross Y; Osiroff R; Kirshenbaum I,,2010,"Innovations (Philadelphia, Pa.)",Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,29905015,Investigation of raphe function in the bicuspid aortic valve and its influence on clinical criteria-A patient-specific finite element study.,"The aortic valve is normally composed of 3 cusps. In one common lesion, 2 cusps are fused together. The conjoined area of the fused cusps is termed raphe. Occurring in 1% to 2% of the population, the bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital cardiac malformation. The majority of BAV patients eventually require surgery. There is a lack in the literature regarding modeling of the raphe (geometry and material properties), its role and its influence on BAV function. The present study aims to propose improvements on these aspects. Three patient-specific finite element models of BAVs were created based on 3D trans-esophageal echocardiography measurements, and assuming age-dependent material properties. The raphe was initially given the same material properties as its underlying cusps. Two levels of validation were performed; one based on the anatomical validation of the pressurized geometry in diastole (involving 7 anatomical measures), as simulated starting from the unpressurized geometry, and the other based on a functional assessment using clinical measurements in both systole and diastole (involving 16 functional measures). The pathology was successfully reproduced in the FE models of all 3 patients. To further investigate the role of the raphe, 2 additional scenarios were considered; (1) the raphe was considered as almost rigid, (2) the raphe was totally removed. The results confirmed the interpretation of the raphe as added stiffness in the fused cusp's rotation with respect to the aortic wall, as well as added support for stress distribution from the fused cusps to the aortic wall.",Dallard J; Labrosse MR; Sohmer B; Beller CJ; Boodhwani M,bicuspid aortic valve; finite element study; organ function; raphe; soft tissues modeling,2018,International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,14648305,Colour Doppler ultrasonography for evaluation of anterior chest blood supply: the possible role of arterial blood supply to the costosternal junction in the aetiology of idiopathic scoliosis in female adolescents.,"This prospective comparative study was carried out to investigate the blood supply to the anterior chest wall by measurement of several anatomical and haemodynamic flow parameters of the internal mammary artery, with the use of colour Doppler ultrasonography, in female scoliotics with idiopathic right convex scoliosis in adolescence. Previous investigations have postulated that asymmetry of the breasts in female adolescents may be linked with the development of right convex thoracic scoliosis. This breast asymmetry is supposed to be linked with anatomical and functional asymmetry of the internal mammary artery that is the main supplier to the mammary gland. However, no measurements of anatomical and haemodynamic parameters of the internal mammary artery have been made to justify or reject the hypothesis of asymmetric blood flow volume to the breasts and costosternal junction in female adolescent scoliotics. Twenty female adolescents with right convex thoracic scoliosis and 16 comparable female individuals without spine deformity were examined with roentgenograms (scoliotics only) to measure scoliosis curve, vertebral rotation and concave and convex rib-vertebra angle at three vertebrae (the apical, one level above and one below the apical vertebra). Doppler ultrasonography was used to measure, at the origin of the internal mammary artery, its lumen diameter, cross-sectional area, time average mean flow and flow volume per minute in scoliotics and controls, which were compared with each other. The roentgenographic parameters were compared with the ultrasonographic parameters in the scoliotics to disclose any relationship. The reliability of colour Doppler ultrasonography was high and the intra-observer variability low (ANOVA, P=0.92-0.94). There was no statistically significant difference in the ultrasonographic parameters of the internal mammary artery between right and left side in each individual as well as between scoliotics and controls. In scoliotics the right mammary artery time average mean velocity increases with the convex ( P<0.05) and concave ( P<0.01) rib-vertebra angle one level above the apical vertebrae and with the apical convex rib-vertebra angle ( P<0.05). The right internal mammary artery flow volume per minute increases with convex ( P<0.01) and concave ( P<0.01) rib-vertebra angle one level above the apical vertebrae and with the apical convex rib-vertebra angle ( P<0.05). Left internal mammary artery cross-sectional area increases with convex apical rib-vertebra angle ( P<0.01) and concave rib-vertebra angle one level above the apical vertebra ( P<0.01). Conclusively, this investigation showed that haemodynamic flow parameters of the right internal mammary artery and anatomical parameters of the left internal mammary artery are significantly correlated with the magnitude of rib-vertebra angles close to the apex of right thoracic scoliosis in female adolescents. This study did not find any evidence for side-difference in vascularity of the anterior thorax wall and, thus, it could not clearly justify previous theories for development of right thoracic scoliosis in female adolescents.",Korovessis P; Iliopoulos P; Misiris A; Koureas G,,2004,"European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the",Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,23787778,Novel irradiated axial rotational flap model in the rodent.,"IMPORTANCE: Patients who require extensive surgical resection of head and neck tumors often have a history of treatment with radiation and chemotherapy. Chemoradiation-induced damage to the skin and soft tissues can cause complications following surgical reconstruction. OBJECTIVE: To design an easily reproducible rodent rotational skin flap and to evaluate the effects of radiation exposure on flap viability. DESIGN AND SETTING: Ten rats at a tertiary university medical center received 40-Gy irradiation to the abdominal wall. Following a recovery period of 1 month, a 3 × 8-cm fasciocutaneous flap based axially on the inferior epigastric vessel was raised and rotated 60° into a contralateral deficit. Five nonirradiated rats underwent the identical procedure as a control. Animals were killed 7 days postoperatively, areas of flap necrosis were documented by an observer blinded to the grouping, and histological specimens were taken to compare flap viability and vessel density. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Flap revascularization and microvascular density. RESULTS: Six of 10 rats in the irradiated group had necrosis of the distal flap ranging from 1 to 6 cm from the distal edge, whereas none of the animals in the control group exhibited necrosis (P < .001). Histologic analysis revealed collagen and vascular changes in the irradiated skin. Vascular density analysis revealed a significant difference between radiated and nonradiated flaps; P = .004, .03, and .01 in the distal, middle, and proximal segments of the flap, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This novel rat axial rotational flap model demonstrates increased flap necrosis and a decrease in vascular density due to the effects of radiation exposure. With use of a linear electron accelerator, a dose of 40 Gy can be delivered to the skin without resulting in devastating gastrointestinal adverse effects.

Maximum ventricular distortion occurred approximately 3 ms after impact which was also the time of maximum chest wall displacement. Between +3 ms and +10 ms the heart moved posteriorly and regained much of its initial shape. Maximal posterior displacement of the body of the heart occurred at approximately +10 ms. Three-dimensional reconstruction showed that the heart moved caudally and to the right, with little rotation.

METHODS: Patient-specific computational fluid dynamics models of 2 cerebral aneurysms were constructed from bilateral 3D rotational angiograms. The flow dynamics of the aneurysm sac were analyzed under the effect of unequal mean flows, phase shifts, and waveforms between the ICAs. A total of 9 simulations were performed for each patient; cine flow velocity simulations and unsteady wall shear stress (WSS) maps were created for each flow condition. Time-dependent curves of average WSS magnitude over selected regions on the aneurysms were constructed. RESULTS: Mean flow unbalances in the feeding vessels tended to shift the regions of elevated WSS towards the dominating inflow jet and to change the magnitude of the WSS peaks. The overall qualitative appearance of the WSS distribution and velocity simulations was not substantially affected. Phase and waveform asymmetry increased the temporal complexity of the hemodynamic patterns and tended to destabilize the flow pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the relative phase and waveform shape in ICAs can significantly affect the complexity and stability of the hemodynamic force distributions. The magnitude of these effects is related to the geometry of the aneurysm and the feeding vessels. Conditions affecting the flow characteristics in the parent arteries of cerebral aneurysms with more than 1 avenue of inflow should be incorporated into flow models.",Castro MA; Putman CM; Cebral JR,,2006,AJNR.

Hollow ceramic microspheres with a composition of 58-72% SiO2, 28-42% Al2O3 (wt%) and an apparent density 0.8-1.0 g cm(-3) were pretreated in 1.0 N NaOH for 2 h before being coated with synthesized calcium hydroxyapatite (HA) particulate sol. The HA-coated hollow microspheres were sintered for 1 h at 600, 800 and 1000 degrees C. SEM analysis revealed that the grain size and pore size of the calcium phosphate coating increased with the sintering temperature. FTIR analysis showed that crystalline calcium hydroxyapatite was present in the coatings sintered at 600 and 800 degrees C. When sintered at 1000 degrees C, the coating consisted of alpha-tricalcium phosphate. All the coatings adhered well, independent of sintering temperature. The trajectory analysis revealed that the hollow microsphere remained suspended in a rotating-wall vessel (RWV), and experienced a low shear stress (approximately 0.6 dyn cm(-2)). Cell culture studies using rat bone marrow stromal cells and osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8) showed that the cells attached to and formed 3-D aggregates with the hollow microspheres in a RWV.

rotating_wall,2058253,[Angiographic and histologic findings in high frequency rotational ablation in coronary arteries in vitro].,"High-frequency rotational angioplasty is a recently developed method for coronary angioplasty in the catheter laboratory. An elliptical burr tip (phi 1.25-2.0 mm) with embedded diamant chips (phi 40-50 microns) is rotated by a helical drive shaft at 150,000-180,000 rpm. The burr is advanced over a 0.009-inch coaxial guide wire. To show the effects of this approach in diseased and healthy vessels, which may be present before and behind a stenosis, 17 atherosclerotic coronary arteries of nine human hearts, and 18 normal coronary arteries of nine pig hearts were treated by this method in vitro. Standardized coronary angiography was performed before and after Rotablator treatment, followed by histological examination. From these data the burr-to-vessel-diameter ratio was calculated for each vessel segment and compared with the angiographical and histological outcome. Partial or complete removal of the circumference of the innermost vessel wall layers was observed regularly. The average removal of tissue in human coronary arteries was limited to the intimal layer and in the pig coronary arteries to the internal elastic membrane. In the pig coronary arteries no intimal tears or dissections occurred, in human coronary arteries tears could be seen frequently (13 of 17 vessels (76%)). Media tears were observed in 3 of 17 vessels; one (2%) media dissection could be demonstrated; no perforation occurred. Thus, the in vitro studies suggest that coronary rotational angioplasty has only a slight effect on the vessel segment next to a stenosis, regardless of the burr-to-vessel-diameter ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Dietz U; Erbel R; Pannen B; Haude M; Nixdorff U; Iversen S; Thoenes W; Auth D; Meyer J,,1991,Zeitschrift fur Kardiologie,Journal Article,,

The aim of this study was to develop polymeric biodegradable stents for application in small caliber blood vessels. Poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxyhexanoate] (PHBHHx), a renewable microbial aliphatic polyester, and poly(ε-caprolactone), a synthetic polyester approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for different biomedical applications, were investigated as suitable polymers for stent development. A novel manufacturing approach based on computer-aided wet-spinning of a polymeric solution was developed to fabricate polymeric stents. By tuning the fabrication parameters, it was possible to develop stents with different morphological characteristics (e.g. pore size and wall thickness). Thermal analysis results suggested that material processing did not cause changes in the molecular structure of the polymers. PHBHHx stents demonstrated great radial elasticity while PCL stents showed higher axial and radial mechanical strength. The developed stents resulted able to sustain proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells within two weeks of in vitro culture and they showed excellent results in terms of thromboresistivity when in contact with human blood.",Puppi D; Pirosa A; Lupi G; Erba PA; Giachi G; Chiellini F,,2017,"Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)",Evaluation Study; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,27440399,Effect of Different Rotational Directions of BJUT-II VAD on Aortic Swirling Flow Characteristics: A Primary Computational Fluid Dynamics Study.,"BACKGROUND The BJUT-II VAD is a novel left ventricular assist device (LVAD), which is thought to have significant effects on the characteristics of aortic swirling flow. However, the precise mechanism of the rotational direction of BJTU-II VAD in the aortic swirling flow is unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS A patient-specific aortic geometric model was reconstructed based on the CT data. Three pump's output flow profiles with varied rotational direction, termed ""counterclockwise"", ""flat profile"", and ""clockwise"", were used as the boundary conditions. The helicity density, area-weighted average of helicity density (Ha), localized normalized helicity (LNH), wall shear stress (WSS), and WSS spatial gradient (WSSG) were calculated to evaluate the swirling flow characteristics in the aorta. RESULTS The results demonstrated that the swirling flow characteristics in the aorta and 3 branches are directly affected by the output blood flow of BJUT-II VAD. In the aortic arch, the helicity density, supported by the clockwise case, achieved the highest value. In the 3 branches, the flat profile case achieved the highest helicity density, whereas the maximum WSS and WSSG generated by clockwise case were lower than in other cases. CONCLUSIONS The outflow of the BJUT-II VAD has significant effects on the aortic hemodynamics and swirling flow characteristics. The helical blood profiles can enhance the strength of aortic swirling flow, and reduce the areas of low WSS and WSSG regions. The clockwise case may have a benefit for preventing development of atherosclerosis in the aorta.",Zhang Q; Gao B; Chang Y,,2016,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,21316789,Impact of aortic repair based on flow field computer simulation within the thoracic aorta.,"Purpose of this computational study is to examine the hemodynamic parameters of velocity fields and shear stress in the thoracic aorta with and without aneurysm, based on an individual patient case and virtual surgical intervention. These two cases, case I (with aneurysm) and II (without aneurysm), are analyzed by computational fluid dynamics. The 3D Navier-Stokes equations and the continuity equation are solved with an unsteady stabilized finite element method. The vascular geometries are reconstructed based on computed tomography angiography images to generate a patient-specific 3D finite element mesh. The input data for the flow waveforms are derived from MR phase contrast flow measurements of a patient before surgical intervention. The computed results show velocity profiles skewed towards the inner aortic wall for both cases in the ascending aorta and in the aortic arch, while in the descending aorta these velocity profiles are skewed towards the outer aortic wall. Computed streamlines indicate that flow separation occurs at the proximal edge of the aneurysm, i.e. computed flow enters the aneurysm in the distal region, and that there is essentially a single, slowly rotating, vortex within the aneurysm during most of the systole. In summary, after virtual surgical intervention in case II higher shear stress distribution along the descending aorta could be found, which may produce more healthy reactions in the endothelium and benefit of vascular reconstruction of an aortic aneurysm at this particular location.",Filipovic N; Milasinovic D; Zdravkovic N; Böckler D; von Tengg-Kobligk H,,2011,Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Wireframe models of the left coronary artery tree at 16 different instants of a cardiac cycle were constructed for the study of its flexing motion. For quantifying the local bending and twisting of the left coronary artery tree, the anatomic landmarks of the bifurcation points are selected as focussed locations. At these points, the space curves of the tree at different cardiac instants were first derived in parametric forms. Curvature and torsion expressions are next obtained in terms of the derivatives with respect to the parameter. This analysis revealed that during the initial contraction of the heart wall, a 2% reduction per millisecond in the radius of curvature occurred near the bifurcation point where the left circumflex coronary artery descends toward the apex of the heart. When the left ventricular chamber reached a maximum value, the radius of curvature was found to decrease at a rate of 2.3% ms-1. At the end of diastole, an increase in the radius of curvature at a rate of 5.7% ms-1 was observed.

rotating_wall,746143,The effects of minor degrees of obliquity on the lateral chest radiograph.,"Minor degrees of obliquity affect the appearance of the lateral chest radiograph. For 100 normal subjects we compared findings on three left lateral projections: the ""straight lateral"", rotation of the subject's right side 10 degrees anterior (""right anterior""), and rotation of the patient's right side 10 degrees posterior (""right posterior""). A number of structures appeared generally best seen in the ""right anterior"" lateral projection, less well seen in the ""straight posterior"" lateral projection and least well seen in ""right posterior"" lateral projection. These structures were the epicardial fat stripe and pericardial line, the anterior margin of the ascending aorta, the hilar vessels, the origins of the upper lobe bronchi, and the posterior wall of the bronchus intermedius. The heart appeared largest in the ""right anterior"" lateral view, while in the ""right posterior"" lateral view it appeared smallest (whether assessed subjectively or by measurement of posterior left ventricular overlap of the inferior vena cava). Similarly, the hilar vascular shadows and major bronchi were most prominent when rotated apart in the ""right anterior"" projection and least prominent when more nearly superimposed in the ""right posterior"" projection. Slight rotation showed no significant effect on the anteroposterior diameter of the trachea, the width of the left pulmonary artery, or the diameters of the upper lobe bronchi. The azygos vein and a well visualized posterior tracheal band were seen in a few patients. They tended to be best and most frequently seen in the ""right posterior"" lateral view. Either obliquity tended to improve delimeation of the anterior pleural margins and the costophrenic angles. This was also true for the interlobar fissures, but confusing superimposition shadows were less likely in the ""right anterior"" than the ""right posterior"" lateral radiograph.",Bachman DM; Ellis K; Austin JH,,1978,Radiologic clinics of North America,Journal Article,,

The developmental anatomy of this region was studied by using frontal, sagittal, or transverse serial histologic sections of 17 normal human embryos of Carnegie stages 15-19 from the Carnegie Embryological Collection. Distances and angles between major anatomic landmarks were determined by using computer reconstructions of the serially sectioned embryos, three-dimensional analytic geometry, and Euclidean distance formulas. The findings show that between stages 15 and 19 there is a marked rotation of the axis of the semilunar valves: frontal 121 degrees counterclockwise, sagittal 196 degrees counterclockwise, and transverse 240 degrees clockwise. Simultaneously the great arteries lengthen at a faster rate than the rest of the heart; and there is also an increase in the caliber and wall thickness of the great arteries. These results suggest that the changing rate of growth between the great arteries and the heart is necessary to align the great arteries, the semilunar valves, and the muscular outflow tract septum appropriately with respect to the interventricular septum. Reductions in the rate of growth of the great arteries relative to the heart could, by causing changes in the rotation of great arteries and outflow tract septum, have a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular malformations such as tetralogy of Fallot and transposition of the great arteries.",Lomonico MP; Moore GW; Hutchins GM,,1986,The Anatomical record,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",HL-22963/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; LM 03651/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States,

A dynamic approach, to assess venous sizes with different degrees of head rotation, has only been performed to improve jugular venous catheterisation. These echographic studies have suggested that head rotation to the contralateral side increases the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the internal jugular veins (IJVs) in supine subjects. Our goal was to evaluate the behaviour of CSA of the IJVs during supine head rotation in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with CCSVI, compared to healthy controls (HCs). METHODS: The IJVs of 313 MS patients with CCSVI (male 43.8%, male/female 137/176; mean age 45 years old, range 19-77 years) and 298 HCs, matched by gender (male 43.6%, male/female 130/168) and age (mean age 46 years old, range 20-79 years), were compared using ECD. Their CSAs were evaluated with the subjects seated in a tiltable chair, first in the supine position at the level of the cricoid cartilage, with the head in a neutral position, and then after contralateral rotation to 90° from midline. RESULTS: Significant differences between the jugular CSAs before and after head rotation were observed only in the MS patients for the IJVs with wall collapse (F[6,1215] = 6414.57, p < 0.001), showing on longitudinal scans a typical ""hourglass"" aspect that we defined as ""miopragic"". No significant difference was found in the distribution of these miopragic veins with regard to MS duration. There was a strong association between the CCSVI scores and the complexity of jugular morphological types (Χ2 [9, N = 313] = 75.183, p < 0.001). Wall miopragia was mainly observed in MS patients with SP (59.3%) and PP (70.0%) clinical forms, compared to RR (48.3%) forms (p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: A dynamic ECD approach allowed us to detect IJVs with a significant increase in their CSAs during head rotation, but only in MS subjects. This feature, most likely the expression of congenital wall miopragia, could be secondary to dysregulation of collagen synthesis, but further histochemical studies will be needed to confirm this hypothesis.",Farina M; Novelli E; Pagani R,,2013,BMC neurology,Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,23812781,Alterations in axial curvature of the cervical spine with a combination of rotation and extension in the conventional anterior cervical approach.,"PURPOSE: Alterations of three-dimensional cervical curvature in conventional anterior cervical approach position are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate alignment changes of the cervical spine in the position. In addition, simulated corpectomy was evaluated with regard to sufficiency of decompression and perforation of the vertebral artery canal. METHODS: Fifty patients with cervical spinal disorders participated. Cervical CT scanning was performed in the neutral and supine position (N-position) and in extension and right rotation simulating the conventional anterior approach position (ER-position). Rotation at each vertebral level was measured. With simulation of anterior corpectomy in a vertical direction with a width of 17 mm, decompression width at the posterior wall of the vertebrae and the distance from each foramen of the vertebral artery (VA) were measured. RESULTS: In the ER-position, the cervical spine was rotated rightward by 37.2° ± 6.2° between the occipital bone and C7. While the cervical spine was mainly rotated at C1/2, the subaxial vertebrae were also rotated by several degrees. Due to the subaxial rotation, the simulated corpectomy resulted in smaller decompression width on the left side and came closer to the VA canal on the right side. CONCLUSIONS: In the ER-position, the degrees of right rotation of subaxial vertebrae were small but significant. Therefore, preoperative understanding of this alteration of cervical alignment is essential for performing safe and sufficient anterior corpectomy of the cervical spine.",Tanahashi H; Miyamoto K; Hioki A; Iinuma N; Ohno T; Shimizu K,,2013,"European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the",Journal Article,,

The patient had successfully undergone subperichondral resection, sternal osteotomy, and pectus bar insertion placed under the depressed sternum, followed by bar rotation for elevation of the chest wall.

rotating_wall,21885712,How do coil configuration and packing density influence intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics?,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular coiling is a well-established therapy for treating intracranial aneurysms. Nonetheless, postoperative hemodynamic changes induced by this therapy remain not fully understood. The purpose of this work is to assess the influence of coil configuration and packing density on intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three 3D rotational angiography images of 3 intracranial aneurysms before and after endovascular coiling were used. For each aneurysm, a 3D representation of the vasculature was obtained after the segmentation of the images. Afterward, a virtual coiling technique was used to treat the aneurysm geometries with coil models. The aneurysms were coiled with 5 packing densities, and each was generated by using 3 coil configurations. Computational fluid dynamics analyses were carried out in both untreated and treated aneurysm geometries. Statistical tests were performed to evaluate the relative effect of coil configuration on local hemodynamics. RESULTS: The intra-aneurysmal blood flow velocity and wall shear stress were diminished as packing density increased. Aneurysmal flow velocity was reduced >50% due to the first inserted coils (packing density <12%) but with a high dependency on coil configuration. Nonsignificant differences (P > .01) were found in the hemodynamics due to coil configuration for high packing densities (near 30%). A damping effect was observed on the intra-aneurysmal blood flow waveform after coiling. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics are altered by coils. Coil configuration might reduce its influence on intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics as the packing density increases until an insignificant influence could be achieved for high packing densities.",Morales HG; Kim M; Vivas EE; Villa-Uriol MC; Larrabide I; Sola T; Guimaraens L; Frangi AF,,2011,AJNR.

A series of transaxial, ventricular short-axis, and long-axis sections were reconstructed, and segmental analysis was performed to predict individual coronary artery involvement. A perfusion defect was observed in 54 of 57 cases with coronary artery disease (95%). Ninety of 108 diseased coronary arteries (83%) were correctly identified (91% of single-vessel disease, 82% of two-vessel disease and 80% of three-vessel disease). No significant perfusion defect was seen in 11 of 13 cases with normal coronary arteries (specificity 85%). Number of diseased coronary arteries was accurately predicted in 78% of those with single-vessel disease, 65% of those with two-vessel disease and 47% of those with three-vessel disease, indicating relatively poor accuracy for predicting multivessel disease. The sensitivity for detecting individual coronary artery involvement was 90% for the right coronary artery (RCA), 89% for the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and 67% for the left circumflex artery (LCX). The specificity was 87%, 91%, and 100%, respectively. Even in those with three-vessel disease, a perfusion defect was seen in 82% of RCA and LAD segments, and 76% of LCX segment. Thus, there were high sensitivity and specificity for detecting individual coronary involvement by ECT imagings. Segmental analysis of ECT imagings was comparatively performed with the findings of contrast ventriculography. Normal wall motion was seen in 95% of normally perfused myocardial segments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Tamaki N; Yonekura Y; Mukai T; Torizuka K; Nohara R; Suzuki Y; Tamaki S; Kadota K; Kambara H; Kawai C,,1983,Journal of cardiography,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,21647968,Topographical anatomy of central venous system in extremely low-birth weight neonates less than 1000 grams and the effect of central venous catheter placement.,"Central venous catheterization is widely used in neonatology. Although ultrasonic guidance for central venous catheter placement is available, complications occur significantly more frequently in infants, especially neonates, than in adults. This study seeks to determine the characteristics, topographical conditions, regional relationships, and diameters of the venous structures of the upper extremity and the thoracic central venous system in extremely small preterm neonates (mean: 900 g). Nine formaldehyde-fixed preterm stillborns were prepared (mean 27 2/7 weeks' gestational age). The anatomical preparation involved the complete thoracic wall, neck and shoulder region, and preparation of the upper extremities. It was shown that the course of the internal jugular vein can be influenced by rotation of the head. Maximum head rotation (80°) to the contralateral side leads the internal jugular vein to overlap the common carotid artery and sharpens the confluence angle of the internal jugular into the brachiocephalic vein. We propose that this has the potential to result in dislocation of the catheter. Less rotation of the head (<30°) is favorable as the internal jugular vein and common carotid artery run in parallel. Commonly used central venous catheters (2F-4F) may not occlude the vascular lumen completely. Small central venous cannulation using a single-orifice catheter through arm veins (1F) may also not occlude peripheral vessels of the upper extremity (cephalic and basilic veins). The right internal jugular vein has a straight course, appears suitable for central venous access and less hazardous, especially when using stiff catheters. The use of small straight wire guides is recommended.",Eifinger F; Brisken K; Roth B; Koebke J,,2011,"Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)",Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,1174457,A scanning electron microscopy study of the endothelial folds in normal and anastomosed common carotid arteries in albino rats.,"The results of this scanning electron microscopy study show that the endothelial folds of the common carotid arteries of rats are composed of rows of 2 or 3 endothelial cells standing alongside one another on the underlying internal elastic lamina. If anastomosed arteries develop a stenosis the endothelial folds, instead of running longitudinally along the vessels, are rotated through 90 degrees to run transversely. The most important factor causing this change in direction of the endothelial folds is fibrosis of the arterial wall following damage to the blood supply of the vessel during dissection and anastomosis.",Bannister CM; Mundy LA; Mundy JE,,1975,British journal of experimental pathology,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,8398999,A novel microporous polyurethane vascular graft: in vivo evaluation of the UTA prosthesis implanted as infra-renal aortic substitute in dogs.,"A novel microporous polyurethane blood conduit developed at the University of Texas at Arlington was implanted as an infra-renal substitute in dogs. The prosthesis was fabricated by precipitating a solution of the polymer with dry nitrogen onto a rotating mandrel. The grafts were sterilized either by gamma radiation (series I) or ethylene oxide (series II); they were implanted for the following prescheduled periods: 4, 24, 48 hours, and 1 week (short-term) and 2, 4 weeks, 3 and 6 months (medium-term). The thrombohematological characteristics of each animal were evaluated prior to implantation and confirmed that the index of blood coagulability was normal. In the short-term group, five out of eight grafts were patent and three were partially occluded; four grafts in the medium-term group were patent; one was partially occluded; and three were thrombosed at retrieval. One week after implantation, the prostheses were surrounded by an external capsule, which was present mainly at the two anastomoses. The external capsule covered the entire graft at 3 months. No kinking of the grafts was observed and the presence of a mild yellow stain related to bilirubin uptake was detected at 2 weeks, 1, 3, and 6 months. Histological studies have revealed the formation of a thin internal capsule at both anastomoses, 2 weeks postimplantation, which was not anchored to the graft wall. In the medium-term group, the thrombosed grafts failed to develop an internal capsule, whereas the patent graft exhibited a thick internal capsule made of neocollagenous tissue over the entire graft. This new microporous polyurethane prosthesis did not perform satisfactorily as an infra-renal substitute in dogs and its in vivo stability requires further assessment. Thus, the concept of a polyurethane with closed pores does not achieve what was anticipated.",Marois Y; Akoum A; King M; Guidoin R; von Maltzahn W; Kowligi R; Eberhart RC; Teijeira FJ; Verreault J,,1993,Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",R15-HL38743.01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,2606060,Fetal breathing movements--a comparison of hard copy records produced by M-mode and Doppler ultrasound.,"To precisely measure the events of the fetal breath cycle it is necessary to have an accurate hard copy record. Two approaches to this have been made using either M-mode or Doppler ultrasound. It was the aim of this paper to compare these methods. Hard copy records of fetal breathing movements were produced by simultaneously recording movements of the fetal chest wall with M-mode and frequency spectral analysis of Doppler signals from either the fetal inferior vena cava or umbilical vein. Timing of the onset and end of inspiration was equally recognised by chest wall movement and changes in umbilical vein flow. Augmented flow in the fetal inferior cava began after the onset of ""inspiration"" and continued into ""expiration"". This signal could be used for registering the occurrence of a breath but not for timing. Because of unequal rotation and distortion of the chest wall, during fetal breathing movements, records of chest wall movement were considered less precise than those from the umbilical vein for timing the events of the fetal breath cycle. The umbilical vein flow velocity sonogram provides an accurate record to allow measurement of ""inspiratory"" time and total breath movement time.",Trudinger BJ; Cook CM,,1989,Early human development,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,26920722,Is the Lecompte technique the last word on transposition of the great arteries repair for all patients? A magnetic resonance imaging study including a spiral technique two decades postoperatively.,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the Lecompte technique and the spiral anastomosis (complete anatomic correction) two decades after arterial switch operation (ASO). METHODS: Nine patients after primary ASO with Lecompte and 6 selected patients after spiral anastomosis were evaluated 20.8 ± 2.1 years after ASO versus matched controls. Blood flow dynamics and flow profiles (e.g. vorticity, helicity) in the great arteries were quantified from time-resolved 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phase contrast flow measurements (4D flow MR) in addition to a comprehensive anatomical and functional cardiovascular MRI analysis. RESULTS: Compared with spiral reconstruction, patients with Lecompte showed more vortex formation, supranatural helical blood flow (relative helicity in aorta: 0.036 vs 0.089; P < 0.01), a reduced indexed cross-sectional area of the left pulmonary artery (155 vs 85 mm²/m²; P < 0.001) and more semilunar valve dysfunctions (n = 5 vs 1). There was no difference in elastic aortic wall properties, ventricular function, myocardial perfusion and myocardial fibrosis between the two groups. Cross-sectional area of the aortic sinus was larger in patients than in controls (669 vs 411 mm²/m²; P < 0.01). In the spiral group, the pulmonary root was rotated after ASO more towards the normal left position (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, selected patients with spiral anastomoses showed, two decades after ASO, better physiologically adapted blood flow dynamics, and attained a closer to normal anatomical position of their great arteries, as well as less valve dysfunction. Considering the limitations related to the small number of patients and the novel MRI imaging techniques, these data may provoke reconsidering the optimal surgical approaches to transposition of the great arteries repair.

rotating_wall,21075736,Effect of posture change on the geometric features of the healthy carotid bifurcation.,"Segmented cross-sectional MRI images were used to construct 3-D virtual models of the carotid bifurcation in ten healthy volunteers. Geometric features, such as bifurcation angle, internal carotid artery (ICA) angle, planarity angle, asymmetry angle, tortuosity, curvature, bifurcation area ratio, ICA/common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA)/CCA, and ECA/ICA diameter ratios, were calculated for both carotids in two head postures: 1) the supine neutral position; and 2) the prone sleeping position with head rotation to the right ( ∼ 80°). The results obtained have shown that head rotation causes 1) significant variations in bifurcation angle [32% mean increase for the right carotid (RC) and 21% mean decrease for the left carotid (LC)] and internal carotid artery angle (97% mean increase for the RC, 43% mean decrease for the LC); 2) a slight increase in planarity and asymmetry angles for both RC and LC; 3) minor and variable curvature changes for the CCA and for the branches; 4) slight tortuosity changes for the braches but not for the CCA; and 5) unsubstantial alterations in area and diameter ratios (percentage changes %).

Work in progress.,"Between December 1986 and October 1988, 83 patients with chronic peripheral artery occlusions were treated with a new technique. In 56 patients, the superficial femoral artery was completely occluded; in 21 patients, the popliteal artery; and in six patients, the iliac artery. The length of occlusion ranged from 5 to 35 cm (mean, 12.5 cm). The duration, estimated by history, was 5-48 months (mean, 16.5 months). In seven patients, durations of 6-36 months were documented angiographically. A flexible, blunt, motor-driven rotating catheter was introduced through an 8-F sheath, and rotational angioplasty was performed at low speed (up to 200 rpm). In 49 of 60 (82%) patients in whom this new technique was used as the primary intervention, the occlusions were successfully reopened. In 23 patients in whom conventional methods had failed more than 4 weeks earlier, the success rate for rotational angioplasty was 67% (12 of 18 patients); when the time interval was less than 4 weeks, only one of five patients was treated successfully. In none of the 83 patients did a perforation occur. This new technique can reopen chronic artery occlusions with a high degree of success and without the danger of vessel-wall perforation, even after failure of conventional techniques.",Vallbracht C; Liermann DD; Prignitz I; Beinborn W; Roth FJ; Kollath J; Landgraf H; Kaltenbach M,,1989,Radiology,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,2779188,"Effect of tilting disk, heart valve orientation on flow through a curved aortic model.","The influence of tilting disk valve orientation on pulsatile flow through a curved tube model of the human aorta was studied. Simultaneous, two-component laser Doppler velocimeter measurements were made in a tube having a 22 mm diameter and 41 mm radius of curvature which simulated the average dimensions of the adult aorta. The blood analog fluid had a viscosity of 3.0 cp and matched the refractive index of the glass model aorta. Results at mid-arch showed low turbulence levels in early systole and no influence of valve orientation. During mid-systole, fluid from the ventricle reached mid-arch exhibiting strong influence of valve orientation and increased turbulence levels. With the major orifice of the valve adjacent to the inner curved wall, the peak turbulent shear stress was 307 dynes/cm2 at mid-arch during mid-systole. When the major orifice was rotated 180 degrees, the peak value was reduced to 91 dynes/cm2 at the same location and time. At the exit of the curved section, the flow was independent of the valve orientation and the turbulent shear the flow was independent of the value orientation and the turbulent shear stress levels were an order of magnitude lower than the peak value at the inlet. This study demonstrated that orienting the major orifice of a tilting disk valve adjacent to the outer curved wall minimized turbulent shear stress levels.",Walker JD; Tiederman WG; Phillips WM,,1989,Journal of biomechanical engineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Dimensions of in vitro ultrasound images from human arteries (eight normal and nine arteriosclerotic) were compared with those from histologic sections of the vessels. In addition, in vivo ultrasound studies (23 normal and 22 arteriosclerotic) of canine femoral arteries were compared with luminal dimensions obtained from angiograms of the vessels. The correlation of in vitro ultrasound images to luminal diameters (n = 22, r = 0.96), adventitial diameters (n = 19, r = 0.83), and wall thickness (n = 19, r = 0.68) in normal human vessels was significant (p less than 0.05). In vitro measurements of images and histologic specimens from human atherosclerotic arteries also correlated significantly (p less than 0.05) with luminal diameters (n = 27, r = 0.91), adventitial diameters (n = 24, r = 0.60), and wall thickness (n = 24, r = 0.62). Morphologically, in vitro images of the wall of normal human arteries had a concentric laminated appearance and atherosclerotic vessels had patchy echodense and echolucent areas. In vivo studies showed significant correlation of diameters for both normal (n = 16, r = 0.91, p less than 0.05) and arteriosclerotic (n = 16, r = 0.57, p less than 0.05) canine arteries compared with luminal dimensions measured from uniplanar angiograms. We conclude that rotating A-scan intraluminal ultrasound accurately defines both normal and atherosclerotic arterial wall morphology and dimensions.

rotating_wall,8000292,Modelling tissue behaviour based on hyperelasticity theory.,"The tissues are during their physiological function, e.g., in the course of growth, adolescence, and aging, subjected to a cyclic mechanical loading and to large displacements and rotations as well. A tissue free of all external tractions is in a state that minimizes its internal power. In the course of aging of the tissues, for instance in the wall of the aorta, the vein, and also in the myocardium or heart valves, the decrease of the water content and increase of the collagen content occurs; while in compact and trabecular bone the contents of both mineral substances and collagen, undergo reduction. In accordance with it, the strain energy function and the constitutive equations of living tissue based on the hyperelasticity theory using rotationless strain were studied. On the base of the proposed eigenvalue decomposition of the rotationless strain tensor and hyperelasticity the strain energy function was formulated as depending on biological time of tissue. The quantity of strain energy function per unit of the biological time, which essentially characterizes the velocity of change of mechanical response of tissue in the course of its aging, was also defined. The coefficient of tissue aging is the further diagnostic parameter, which is independent of the rotationless strain tensor and expresses the relative change of mechanical response of tissue during the biological time. The corresponding constitutive equation of tissue depending on the biological time is also determined. On the base of the regression analysis the theoretical stress-strain curves for myocardium and blood vessels were determined. The numerical results reveal that the coefficient of aging progressively increases in hardening tissues (coronary artery, vena cava inferior) whereas at the softening tissues it has a relatively slow increase at the dependence on tissue aging.",Valenta J; Růzicka M; Cihák R,,1994,Bio-medical materials and engineering,Journal Article,,

rotating_wall,11568040,Autologous endothelialized vein allograft: a solution in the search for small-caliber grafts in coronary artery bypass graft operations.,"BACKGROUND: Early graft failure after the use of less satisfactory autologous grafts (30% of all vein grafts) is caused primarily by the following problems: (1) suitable autologous transplants are limited; (2) biotechnology has not yet been able to produce reliable graft substitutes that are legally and ethically approved; and (3) current prosthetic materials are prothrombotic. To overcome these problems, we developed an easily accessible, quality-controlled graft. METHODS AND RESULTS: Human autologous venous endothelial cells (HAVECs) were isolated from short segments of peripheral veins unsuitable for bypass grafting. After mechanical deendothelialization of cryopreserved allograft veins (CAVs) and precoating with recipient autologous serum, these homologous cells were seeded by use of a rotating device. Growth of a confluent HAVEC layer within 1 week in a special incubator was observed. After histological and mechanical tests, 12 patients received 15 grafts in total. Bypass operation was followed by clinical and angiographic follow-up. Production period was 22+/-8 days. HAVEC-coated CAVs showed normal connective tissue wall structure and a tight endothelial monolayer (burst pressure >2000 mm Hg). To date, 12 CABG patients lacking suitable autologous graft material have been treated. One patient died of a cause unrelated to the grafts, which were found morphologically normal and patent during autopsy. Of 15 grafts, 2 were occluded at the first angiographic follow-up. The oldest graft has now been in place for approximately 3 years. Immune suppression was not administered.

rotating_wall,17027993,Movement of a spherical cell in capillaries using a boundary element method.,"This study aims to investigate the translation and rotation of a spherical particle in capillaries and overcomes limitations in previous studies by using a boundary element method. The capillary, a straight cylindrical tube, is filled with a Newtonian viscous fluid. A spherical particle is arbitrarily positioned in the capillary either co-centrically or eccentrically and is free to translate and rotate. Flow in the capillary is first assumed to be caused solely by the movement of the sphere under the gravity. When a steady state is reached, the net force and torque on the sphere are zero. The translating velocity and rotation of the particle are calculated from equilibrium equations. For a co-centric sphere, our result agrees to Bohlin's analytical solution (Bohlin, 1960) and the difference is less than 1%. For an eccentrically positioned sphere in the tube, there are no analytical solutions unless the eccentricity is infinitesimal. Results by boundary element method (BEM) give an improved estimations on the velocity and rotation of the sphere than earlier results by a boundary singularity method (BSM), particularly when the clearance between the tube and the sphere becomes small. Movement of a spherical particle in a capillary driven by a pressure gradient is further investigated, which has closer relevance to movement of blood cells in capillaries. The current study using BEM enables investigation on cell movement in close proximities of the capillary wall.",Wen PH; Aliabadi MH; Wang W,,2007,Journal of biomechanics,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,23890399,Effects of biventricular pacing on left heart twist and strain in a porcine model of right heart failure.,"BACKGROUND: Biventricular pacing (BiVP) improves cardiac output (CO) in selected cardiac surgery patients, but response remains variable, necessitating a better understanding of the mechanism. Accordingly, we used speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) to analyze BiVP during acute right ventricular pressure overload (RVPO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In nine pigs, the inferior vena cava (IVC) was snared to decrease CO and establish a control model. Heart block was induced, the pulmonary artery snared, and BiVP initiated. Echocardiograms of the left ventricular midpapillary level were taken at varying atrioventricular delay (AVD) and interventricular delay (VVD) for STE analysis of regional circumferential strain (CS) and radial strain (RS). Echocardiograms were taken of the left ventricular base, midpapillary, and apex during baseline, IVC occlusion, and each BiVP setting for STE analysis of twist, apical and basal rotations, CS, RS, and synchrony. Indices were correlated against CO with mixed linear models. RESULTS: During IVC occlusion, CO correlated with twist, apical rotation, RS, RS synchrony, and CS (P < 0.05). During RVPO with BiVP, CO only correlated with RS synchrony and CS (P < 0.05). During AVD and VVD variations, CO was associated with free wall RS (P < 0.008). CO correlated with septal wall CS during AVD variation and free wall CS during VVD variation (P < 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In an open chest model, twist, RS, RS synchrony, and CS analyzed by STE may be noninvasive surrogates for changes in CO. During RVPO, changes in RS synchrony and CS with varying regional strain contributions may be the primary mechanism in which BiVP improves CO. Lack of correlation of remaining indices may reflect postsystolic function.",Wang A; Cabreriza SE; Havalad V; Aponte-Patel L; Gonzalez G; Velez de Villa B; Cheng B; Spotnitz HM,Biventricular pacing; Right ventricular pressure overload; Speckle tracking echocardiography,2013,The Journal of surgical research,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",R01 HL080152/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,12496565,"The dorsal scapular island flap: an alternative for head, neck, and chest reconstruction.","The back has become an increasingly popular donor site for flaps because it can provide thin, pliable tissue, with minimal bulk, and the scar can be easily hidden under clothing. The authors performed a cadaveric and clinical study to evaluate the anatomy of the dorsal scapular vessels and their vascular contribution to the skin, fascia, and muscles of the back. On the basis of anatomical studies in 28 cadavers and clinical experience with 32 cases, it was concluded that the dorsal scapular vessels provide a reliable blood supply to the skin of the medial back, making it a versatile flap to use as an island flap.

rotating_wall,8240148,Visualisation of arterial structure in vivo with intravascular ultrasound.,"BACKGROUND: Contrast angiography provides a silhouette of the arterial lumen, but does not give information about arterial wall structure. Catheter-tip ultrasound transducers can now provide a cross-sectional image of the arterial wall. This study examined the pathological correlation of intravascular ultrasound images and the accuracy of ultrasound measurements of vascular geometry. METHODS: Intravascular ultrasound images were obtained with a mechanically rotated catheter-tip transducer and recorded on videotape. Initial validation studies were performed in fresh, post-mortem arterial specimens, which were filled with saline at physiological pressures. Ultrasound images at specific sites were compared with the pathological findings at that site and measurements of luminal diameter were compared with corresponding angiographic measurements. Subsequently, intravascular ultrasound was employed to examine the aorta, ilio-femoral and coronary arteries in patients undergoing balloon angioplasty. RESULTS: The pathological correlations showed that intravascular ultrasound can detect early initial thickening and mild atherosclerotic lesions that do not result in luminal deformation. Ultrasound images provided definition of calcified, fibrotic and lipid-filled lesions. Ultrasound measurements of luminal diameter correlated well with pathology measurements (r = 0.93), as did ultrasound measurements of plaque area (r = 0.89). The in vivo studies demonstrated that intravascular ultrasound can define atheroma lesions not evident on contrast angiography and permits detailed evaluation of the results of interventions such as balloon angioplasty. CONCLUSIONS: Intravascular ultrasound provides a unique window upon arterial structure and pathology in humans. Ultrasound images allow accurate measurements of vascular geometry and define early atheromatous lesions that are not evident with angiography.",Jeremy R; Hasche E; Sinclair E; Brieger D; Huang H; Waugh R; Bailey B,,1993,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

The mid left anterior descending and the circumflex vessels were treated in 4 dogs serially with 1 wk separating treatments. The acute and follow-up anterior descending artery size was unchanged (1.41 mm before, 1.39 mm after, and 1.59 mm at 1 week). Similar findings were obtained in the circumflex vessels. In 4 adult human amputated legs, diseased peroneal or tibial arteries were treated with a significant reduction in the percent luminal diameter stenosis from 62.75 prior to intervention to 36.5 following intervention (p = 0.021). The luminal diameter increased from 0.81 to 1.54 mm (p = 0.06). In 2 canine arteries there was histologic evidence of localized perforation of the arterial wall, but there was no angiographic evidence of perforation or dissection and no significant myocardial necrosis in the distribution of the treated vessels at 1 wk. The majority of the diseased human vessels demonstrated smoothly cut atheromas with sparing of the media. The rotational atherectomy catheter system holds promise for removal of plaque in relatively small, diffusely diseased, tortuous vessels.",Smalling RW; Cassidy DB; Schmidt WA; Barrett R; Fulford S; Kirkeeide RL,,1991,Catheterization and cardiovascular diagnosis,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,9538565,Abdominal aorta and visceral arteries visualized by transgastric echocardiography: technical considerations.,"Despite the necessity of information regarding the abdominal aorta and visceral arteries during cardiovascular surgery, there has been no intraoperative modality available. We examined the feasibility and limitations of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for this purpose. In 21 consecutive patients, the celiac artery (CEA), superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and left and right renal arteries (LRA, RRA) were examined with TEE, and could be visualized in 21 cases (100%), 20 cases (95.2%), 14 cases (66.7%) and 14 cases (66.7%), respectively. Several attempts were needed for successfully visualizing the LRA and the RRA in 2 and 1 case(s), respectively. Three specific manipulations of the probe were helpful for visualizing these vessels: 1) an appropriate counterclockwise rotation and an upward flexion of the probe when the transducer entered the stomach; 2) a stiffening of the flexible portion of the probe at the position of upward flexion by fixing the handle of the TEE probe when the transducer was advanced; and 3) a lateral flexion of the probe to provide a rotation of the image in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction and to optimize the assessment of the blood flow velocity in the branch artery. Inferior visualization of the renal arteries was a limitation of this method. Two solutions for this problem were 1) repeated attempts at visualization and 2) an examination of the blood flow in the renal parenchyma with color Doppler imaging. Because of possible damage to the gastric wall, it is recommended that this maneuver be conducted by an experienced sonographer.",Orihashi K; Matsuura Y; Sueda T; Shikata H; Morita S; Hirai S; Sueshiro M; Okada K,,1997,Hiroshima journal of medical sciences,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,10998756,Fluid dynamics and atherosclerosis development in the human thoracic aorta: a transesophageal echocardiographic evaluation of protruding aortic plaque distribution and motion.,"The pathogeneses of atherosclerosis in the thoracic aorta is heterogeneous and still incompletely elucidated. Protruding aortic plaques (PAP), reliable markers of atherosclerosis development and extension, could be easily identified by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). A close relation between atherosclerosis development in the thoracic aorta, stroke and peripheral emboli were established. The purpose of this study was to use PAP distribution and motion on TEE to characterize atherogenesis in the human thoracic aorta. Out of 569 consecutive patients (age range 18-83 years), 108 were referred for TEE to evaluate recent embolism (Group I). The remaining 461 patients were referred for TEE for reasons unrelated to embolism (Group II). The plaque thickness was measured perpendicularly to the aortic wall. In the subgroup of patients with multiple mobile lesions, multiple vortices were suggested to be present when simultaneous rotations in different directions were found. The presence of a fixed PAP was associated with a statistically significant, albeit moderate, increase in the risk for embolism (adjusted odds ratio 4.1). The presence of mobile lesions was linked to an abrupt augmentation in this risk (adjusted odds ratio 30.1). Among the 35 patients in Group I there were 69 PAP: 8 (12%) in the ascending, 28 (41%) in the arch and 33 (48%) in the descending aorta. A total of 34 mobile lesions was detected: 1 (one patient) in the ascending aorta, 15 (10 patients) in the arch and 18 (11 patients) in the descending aorta. There was no significant difference between the arch and the descending aorta regarding the frequency of the plaques in these regions, whereas the ascending aorta presented the lowest prevalence for atheromatosis. Diastolic retrograde and rotational flows were observed in all patients. There were 16 multiple mobile PAP in 6 patients: in all these cases simultaneous rotations of mobile aortic plaques (MAP) in different directions (highly suggestive for the presence of multiple vortices and significant flow instability) were found in the arch and the descending but not the ascending aorta. Protruding aortic plaques and signs of relative aortic flow instability (presence of vortices) are mainly observed in the human arch and in the descending aorta, whereas the ascending aorta presented the lowest prevalence for atheromatosis. This issue may have significant implications in the study of atherosclerosis development in the human thoracic aorta and the pathogeneses of embolic events.",Tenenbaum A; Motro M; Shapira I; Feinberg MS; Schwammenthal E; Pines A; Vered Z; Fisman EZ,,2000,Journal of medicine,Evaluation Study; Journal Article,,

rotating_wall,9650670,Development of a flow estimation and control system of an implantable centrifugal blood pump for circulatory assist.,"A bypass flow rate estimation and control system (BECS) for an implantable centrifugal blood pump (ICBP) has been developed in our institute. The estimated flow rate (EF) of the ICBP was derived from the electric power consumption, the rotating speed of a motor, and the blood viscosity presumed by the hematocrit and body temperature. The error in the EF was 0.5 +/- 0.4 L/min in in vivo experiments for 40 days. The rotating speed of the motor was controlled automatically every 200 ms to bring the EF in accord with the desired flow rate (DF). The reactivity and accuracy of the BECS were investigated in in vitro and in vivo experiments. The ICBP was operated by the BECS in a mock circuit in parallel with a pulsatile ventricular assist device (PVAD) to simulate left heart bypass. The reactivity was evaluated by changing the DF from 7 L/min to 5 L/min at an afterload of 160/97 mm Hg. To evaluate the accuracy of the BECS, the ICBP was driven under the aortic pressure of 110/85 mm Hg in the abdominal wall of an adult goat (70 kg). The DF was set at 5 L/min for 4 min for the goat in an awake condition. It took 13 s to change the flow rate in the in vitro experiment. The measured flow rate (MF) was maintained at 5.0 +/- 0.2 L/min by the BECS in vivo. In conclusion, the BECS has moderate reactivity and accuracy.",Wakisaka Y; Okuzono Y; Taenaka Y; Chikanari K; Endo S; Masuzawa T; Takano H,,1998,Artificial organs,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,24050510,In-situ characterization of the uncrimping process of arterial collagen fibers using two-photon confocal microscopy and digital image correlation.,"Uncrimping of collagen fibers in the arterial wall is an integral process in regulating the macro-level mechanical response of arteries. Uncrimping of collagen fibers leads to a gradual, but significant strain-stiffening response of the artery at physiological pressures and prevents overdistention at elevated pressures. In this study, we imaged adventitial collagen fibers from fresh primate arteries using two-photon excitation microscopy while subjecting the arteries to physiological inflation pressures and axial stretches. The imaging focal plane was fixed at a constant radial location in the adventitial wall by adjusting the focal distance as the arteries inflated, allowing for the continuously monitoring of the uncrimping process of a single region of collagen fibers. Digital image correlation was then applied to the sequential images to assess and correlate the local displacements to manual traces of selected reference fibers and their engagements. We found that the collagen fibers of interest became fully engaged at a luminal pressure of 20mmHg, this was then followed by rotation of these fibers as the bulk artery continued to dilate. This technique helps to further the understanding of the uncrimping process of collagen fibers under physiological loads, which can aid in the development of more accurate microstructural constitutive models.",Wang R; Brewster LP; Gleason RL Jr,Adventitia; Arterial mechanics; Deformation; Digital image correlation; Two-photon excitation microscopy,2013,Journal of biomechanics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",P51 OD011132/OD/NIH HHS/United States; R21 HL085822/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,1521182,Effect of pressure on circumferential order of adventitial collagen in human brain arteries.,"A key factor in the contribution of collagen fibres to tissue mechanics is the alignment of the fibres, which we studied in brain arteries, focussing on alignment changes with distending pressure. Arteries from autopsy were cannulated and fixed at different distending pressures from 0 to 200 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.32 Pa), alcohol dehydrated, paraffin embedded, sectioned, and stained for birefringent enhancement. The polarized light microscope was set for extinction and fibre orientations were precisely determined at the rotational position of extinction for 200 positions around the artery wall. Results from 22 arterial cross sections revealed, with fixation pressure, a significant but incomplete straightening of collagen (even at 200 mmHg). The mean angular deviation of alignment of fibres was +/- 30 degrees for arteries fixed at zero transmural pressure, which in contrast was +/- 7 degrees for the inner and +/- 13 degrees for the mid-adventitia for arteries fixed at 200 mmHg transmural pressure. We verified on vessels fixed at low pressure, by using a full wave plate in conjunction with the specificity of the interference colours, that the measurements were correct and not confused with angles at 90 degrees to the morphological axis. Alternative tissue processing was done with two arteries fixed at 120 mmHg and processed for frozen sections; the results showed diminished variability in alignment but within the range of measurements for wax embedded tissue. We concluded that the collagen fabric could contribute to the mechanics of brain arteries but that it would be with sinusoidal rather than straightened fibres of collagen.",Canham PB; Whittaker P; Barwick SE; Schwab ME,,1992,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

In this study, we evaluated blood flow and movement of the aortic arch. In 10 healthy young volunteers, ECG-gated cine magnetic resonance imaging was carried out in the axial plane of the transverse arch, the coronal plane of the ascending arch, and the long axial plane along the entire arch. 1. Left anterolateral movements around the midpoint of the transverse arch in the systolic phase were observed in all of the men (6.3 +/- 1.59 mm) and women (4.8 +/- 0.73 mm). 2. A jet flow was detected in the systolic phase along the right side of the aortic wall. At the top of the plane, this jet flow turned to the left in a clockwise rotation in the anterior view. 3. In the long axial plane, a turbulent flow in the systolic phase was observed distal to the left subclavian arterial orifice in 6 of the 7 cases. In conclusion, this turbulent flow and left anterolateral wall motion of the transverse arch are due to anatomical three-dimensional distortion of the transverse arch.

The model also shows regions of low velocity, rotational flow and low near wall shear stress along parts of the walls of the carotid artery that have been identified as being prone to atherosclerosis.

In the left-sided aorta, a systolic clockwise rotational component was present, while helical flow was depicted in the aortic arch that was converted in the descending aorta as counter-rotating vortices with accompanying retrograde flow. The right-sided configuration has not altered the orientation of the three-dimensional vortex, but intensification of polymorphic flow patterns, alterations in wall shear stress distribution and development of a lateral pressure gradient at the area of an aneurysmal anomaly was observed. Moreover, increments of Reynolds, Womersley and Dean numbers were evident.

rotating_wall,1539711,Mechanical effects of coronary perfusion in the passive canine left ventricle.,"Mechanical effects of coronary perfusion on passive left ventricular filling were studied in seven isolated potassium-arrested dog hearts subjected to static pressure loading. With the use of a biplane video method, midanterior epicardial deformations were measured before, during, and after perfusion of the coronary circulation with a cardioplegic solution. During perfusion, there was a highly significant reduction (P less than 0.001) in ventricular compliance; the mean cavity volume change decreased by 50% at a filling pressure of 12 mmHg. The loss of compliance was reversible and increased with coronary artery pressure. The magnitudes of the principal epicardial extensions, determined by homogeneous strain analysis, also decreased significantly (P less than 0.001) by an average of 30-40% at ventricular pressures of 4-12 mmHg. But there was no change in the pattern of epicardial deformations. These findings, and similar significant falls in epicardial in-plane rotation (P less than 0.05) and angular translation (P less than 0.001), suggest that the main mechanical effect of the coronary circulation is homogeneous and uniform and is, therefore, probably associated with the microcirculation. We propose that this effect may be modeled by treating the myocardium as a porous elastic medium swollen with an incompressible fluid rather than by an increase in ventricular wall thickness due to filling of the coronary vessels.",McCulloch AD; Hunter PJ; Smaill BH,,1992,The American journal of physiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",HL-41603/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve SG-BVVs, consisting of small intestinal submucosa attached to a nitinol frame were placed across a natural valve (NV) in the distal JV in six sheep. Six SG-BVVs were oriented as NV leaflets (group A) and the other six SG-BVVs were rotated 90 degrees to NV leaflets (group B). SG-BVV function was studied by venography performed immediately after placement and at 5 weeks after placement. Animals were killed at 5 weeks, and gross examinations were performed. RESULTS: Desired valve orientation after deployment was seen in all SG-BVVs. In group A, all valves exhibited good valve function on immediate and 5-week venography. At gross examination, leaflets were attached mostly at the valve base and free cusp areas were similar in both cusps with a mean of 154.8 mm2 +/- 45.6 for one cusp and 142 mm2 +/- 53.4 for the other cusp (P = .188). In group B, all valves showed good function on immediate venography and in five valves prior to killing. Valve attachment to the vein wall in this group involved a longer segment of leaflets and their free areas were smaller with a wide variety of cusp sizes. Mean free leaflet areas of opposing cusps measured 106.3 mm2 +/- 36.5 and 66.1 mm2 +/- 34.6, respectively (P = .025). Difference in leaflet areas between group A and group B was significant (P = .019).

A descriptive geometrical model was therefore developed and expanded to 16 elements each containing 16 constants by a serial optimising technique using a least-squares method. Published data from two different studies on velocity distribution in the ascending aorta comprising six subjects with normal aortic valves were used. Three-dimensional graphic displays of velocity profile at different time intervals of the heart cycle clearly show common features of distribution of velocity at a point 6 cm above the aortic valve. There was a pronounced skewness with clockwise rotation of the skewness direction during systole, reversed flow directed towards the left coronary sinus of Valsalva in late systole and early diastole concomitant with secondary flow augmentation along the opposite wall of the aorta.

Three-dimensional numerical simulations are performed using a finite elements method. We consider a geometrical model of the host coronary artery with and without a 75% severity stenosis for three different locations from the anastomosis. The flow features - velocity profiles, secondary motions and wall shear stresses - are compared for different configurations of the flow rate and of the distance of the anastomosis from the site of occlusion (called distance of grafting). The combination of the junction flow effects - counter rotating vortices - with the stenosis effects - confined jet flow - is particularly important when the distance of grafting is short. Given that the residual flow issued from the pathologic stenosis being non-negligible after two weeks grafting, models without stenosis cannot predict the evolution of the wall shear stress in the vicinity of the anastomosis.",Bertolotti C; Deplano V,,2000,Journal of biomechanics,Comparative Study; Journal Article,,

We investigate the effects of the spiral blood flow in a model of three-dimensional arterial stenosis with a 75% cross-sectional area reduction at the centre by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques. The standard k-omega model is employed for simulation of the blood flow for the Reynolds number of 500 and 1000. We find that for Re=500 the spiral component of the blood flow increases both the total pressure and velocity of the blood, and some significant differences are found between the wall shear stresses of the spiral and non-spiral induced flow downstream of the stenosis. The turbulent kinetic energy is reduced by the spiral flow as it induces the rotational stabilities in the forward flow. For Re=1000 the tangential component of the blood velocity is most influenced by the spiral speed, but the effect of the spiral flow on the centreline turbulent kinetic energy and shear stress is mild. The results of the effects of the spiral flow are discussed in the paper along with the relevant pathological issues.",Paul MC; Larman A,,2009,Medical engineering & physics,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,20447636,Cross-flow at the anterior communicating artery and its implication in cerebral aneurysm formation.,"The anterior communicating artery (ACoA) is an important element of the circle of Willis. While the artery itself is short and small, a large number of intracranial aneurysms can be found at the ACoA. Four subject-specific ACoA models are constructed from 3D rotational angiographic images. The ACoA of these models ranged from 1.7 to 2.7 mm in diameter and 1.5 to 5.7 mm in length. Pulsatile flows through these four ACoA models are studied numerically. Blood is found to move in two opposite directions simultaneously within the ACoA, giving a much higher wall shear at the ACoA. These two opposite flow streams produce a cross-flow that is dependent on the flow rates at the anterior cerebral arteries and internal carotid arteries (ICAs). A larger and shorter ACoA allows flow through the ACoA easily, leading to a greater cross-flow and higher hemodynamic forces on the artery. This cross-flow may disappear when there is a sufficient net flow for a smaller and longer ACoA. Wall shear stress can be as high as 185 Pa at smaller ACoAs, but it can be lowered by asymmetric waveforms at the ICAs. A functional circle of Willis also promotes cross-flow at both the ACoA and posterior communicating arteries.",Jou LD; Lee DH; Mawad ME,,2010,Journal of biomechanics,Journal Article,,

Sonographic images were obtained using a 4.8Fr catheter with a crystal mechanically rotated at 900 rpm; quantitative coronary angiograms were recorded in biplane projections. In 18 patients, qualitatively as well as quantitatively evaluable images could be recorded; no complications occurred. The venous wall in general appeared to be homogenous; there were no separate layers identifiable. Simultaneous ultrasound and angiographic measurements were performed at a total of 75 sites (2 to 6 per bypass). In 4 of these patients (10 of 75 sites), neither intravascular ultrasound nor angiography revealed any pathologic changes; these bypasses were classified as normal. At the remaining 65 sites, arteriosclerotic lesions were detected in each case by ultrasound, but at only 33 sites by angiography.

The numerical tool FLOW3D (AEA Industrial Technology, Oxfordshire, UK) utilized body-fitted coordinates and a finite volume discretization procedure. Purely axial velocity profiles were introduced at the entrance of the model for a range of cardiac outputs. The four-branch numerical model developed for this investigation produced flow and shear conditions comparable to those found in other reported works. The total wall shear stress distribution in the iliac and renal arteries followed standard trends. with maximum shear stresses occurring in the apex region and lower shear stresses occurring along the lateral walls. Shear stresses and flow rate ratios in the downstream arteries were more effected by inlet Re than the upstream arteries.

The aortic arch exhibited a single cell of clockwise-rotating helical secondary flow along the ventral and inner walls. Flow separation occurred proximal to the two arch branches with flow reversal proximal to the brachiocephalic artery. Sinusoidal flow rendered the helical motion more pronounced in systole, while the reverse flow zone periodically expanded and contracted. Steady flow in the abdominal aorta revealed streamlines which follow slow looping trajectories lateral to ostia before tracing helical paths into the branches. Flow separation was present along the dorsal wall of the aorta opposite the superior mesenteric artery. With the exception of the left renal artery, steady flow wall shear stresses were higher distal to ostia than proximal. Spatial gradients of wall shear stress were larger around branches than elsewhere.

rotating_wall,8313560,"Arterial imaging with a new forward-viewing intravascular ultrasound catheter, II. Three-dimensional reconstruction and display of data.","BACKGROUND: Current intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) catheters provide transverse imaging at the level of the ultrasound transducer. This limits imaging to large-diameter segments without critical atherosclerotic narrowings. We have developed a prototype 20-MHz forward-viewing IVUS catheter that provides two-dimensional sector imaging distal to the catheter tip. A present limitation of this technique is that the catheter must be manually rotated to obtain multiple longitudinal views required to integrate the segment into a three-dimensional matrix. To overcome this, we have developed an algorithm that reconstructs these multiple two-dimensional forward-viewing IVUS images into a three-dimensional matrix for more complete depiction of the segment distal to the ultrasound catheter. This algorithm allows display and multidimensional slicing of the three-dimensional reconstruction. METHODS AND RESULTS. To test our algorithms, five arterial segments (three canine aortas, two human femoral arteries) were evaluated in vitro. In each segment, 36 forward-viewing longitudinal slices were collected, digitized, processed, and reoriented to produce a three-dimensional reconstruction (3DR) matrix. The matrix data were sliced into parallel transverse sections and compared with morphometric interpretation of histological sections (Histo). As a result, image data could be reconstructed for a distance of 2.0 cm ahead of the catheter. 3DR easily demonstrated wall and luminal morphology and provided transverse IVUS images comparable to the histological specimens. A good correlation was noted between Histo- and 3DR-determined luminal diameters (LD) and luminal areas: 3DR LD = 1.4 Histo LD-0.4, r = .86; 3DR LD = 0.7 +/- 0.20 cm (mean +/- SD); and Histo LD = 0.7 +/- 0.13 cm. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of 3DR of forward-viewing IVUS data. This method allows rapid, detailed analysis of diseased arterial segments previously unavailable with standard IVUS and may permit better targeting of interventional techniques.",Ng KH; Evans JL; Vonesh MJ; Meyers SN; Mills TA; Kane BJ; Aldrich WN; Jang YT; Yock PG; Rold MD; et al.,,1994,Circulation,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",HL-46550/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,

At operation, collateral vessels of 1-mm proportions were noted to have developed between the innervated teres major and denervated latissimus dorsi muscle. In this case, the teres major muscle rotated with the latissimus muscle to affect reconstruction of a full-thickness anterior chest resection. This report suggests the possibility of a denervated, relatively devascularized muscle obtaining additional blood supply from adjacent innervated vascularized muscles and supports the concept of rotating the muscles as a unit to encourage viability of the denervated component.",May JW Jr; Toth BA; Cohen AM,,1982,Plastic and reconstructive surgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,,

A full 3D non-linear CFD simulation was conducted to estimate the wall shear stress (WSS) distribution. The model cell was capable of random rotation, deformation, migration, and proliferation. Flow was computed after each update of the cell shape with infinitesimal configuration changes. After a finite interval of the flow computation, only the infinitesimal configuration changes that reduced the WSS were allowed to accumulate. As a result of the very long free-run computation experiment, starting with a sub-confluent pattern of cells, the model cells became confluent and were elongated and aligned, with a shape index (SI) very close to that reported for cells in vivo. The average WSS converged to the lowest value at the same time.",Yamaguchi T; Yamamoto Y; Liu H,,2000,Journal of biomechanics,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,2145785,Experimental and clinical percutaneous angioscopy experience with dynamic angioplasty.,"The authors have used ultrathin angioscopes with high optical resolution to assess the effects of dynamic angioplasty in vitro and in vivo. Experimentally, angioscopy was used to study the effects of the 5F ""Kensey"" catheter in ""normal"" porcine coronary arteries (NPCA) and postmortem human coronary arteries (PMHCA). In NPCA, the catheter keeps a coaxial position. Intimal flaps (IFs) were seen in 21/23 NPCAs. They occurred with all cam rotation speeds and were usually single and small (less than 25% of lumen). Perforations in patent arteries were rare (1/23). However, when the catheter was forced against the wall by passing through a narrowing of 5F diameter (made by a band ligature), perforations were more common at higher cam speeds. The epicardium remained intact in two thirds of perforations. Angioscopy visualized perforations in only 10% of cases (1/10), the common sign being that of large and multiple intimal flaps, which were often obstructive (5/10). In PMHCAs, angioscopy was more sensitive than angiography in detecting atheromatous lesions. The authors were able to give a better assessment of the effect of dynamic angioplasty on treated lesions, including the demonstration of intimal flaps that were not visible on angiography. In vivo, they have performed percutaneous angioscopy before and after dynamic angioplasty using 8 French Kensey catheters.

The velocity was controlled by regulating the height of the reservoir. The working fluid consists of glycerine and water mixture with viscosity of 3.75 mPa.s similar to human blood. Instantaneous velocity fields were obtained by PIV and the shear stresses were calculated according to the velocity. The results showed that inside the model, there were a large flow separation and an anticlockwise rotating vortex on the lateral wall of ICA, The location and distance of the vortex changed with the flow velocity. The higher the flow velocity, the smaller the vortex distance, and the farther the location. The shear stresses on the lateral wall were significantly lower in all work condition. And there a low shear stress kernel when the velocity was lower than 0.839 m/s. The location of the low shear stress was just the position of atherosclerosis. The flow pattern inside the model consists of large flow separation and vortex zones.

Only platelets were studied that could be localized objectively within a thin optical section around the median plane of the vessel. The orientation of a platelet was assessed from its microscopic image and described by an angle pair, assuming the platelet to be an ellipsoidal body and using an empirical frequency distribution for its thickness to diameter ratio. The orientation of the platelets was not random; they tended to align themselves with their equatorial planes parallel to the wall. The degree of alignment increased from the center of the vessel toward the wall. As a corollary a frequency distribution of their diameter (3.15 +/- 0.72 micron (mean +/- sd) was obtained in vivo.",Teirlinck HC; Tangelder GJ; Slaaf DW; Muijtjens AM; Arts T; Reneman RS,,1984,Biorheology,Journal Article,,

We investigated the handling, performance, safety, and stability for a novel 4Fr LV lead with a small side helix located proximal to the ring electrode for active fixation of the LV lead. METHODS AND RESULTS: The novel LV lead was successfully implanted in 103 of 106 patients. Patients with dislodged LV leads and with demanding coronary vein anatomies were included. The lead body was rotated clockwise to engage the active fixation side helix in the vein wall. The stimulating electrode was located in basal LV segment and middle LV segment in 54 and 46% of the patients, respectively. The lead was targeted to a vein concordant to the LV segment with latest mechanical activation. Concordant LV lead placement was achieved in 73% of the patients and in adjacent segment in 24%. The average pacing capture threshold (PCT) at implantation was 1.04 ± 0.6 V (n = 103) and at an average follow-up at 7 months, the PCT remained low and no dislodgements have been observed. During follow-up, four leads have been explanted without complications. CONCLUSION: Active fixation of this 4Fr LV lead by using a side helix, offers flexibility to place the lead precisely in targeted vein segments over a wide range of vein anatomies. The average LV pacing threshold was low at implantation and follow-ups. The lead seems to be extractable and no late dislodgements have been observed. The Author 2015.

rotating_wall,2972188,Results of low speed rotational angioplasty for chronic peripheral occlusions.,"After experimental investigation using postmortem human arteries, 19 patients with chronic peripheral artery occlusions were treated with a new angioplasty technique between December 1986 and October 1987. In 17 patients the superficial femoral artery and in 2 patients the popliteal artery were completely occluded. The length of the occlusions ranged between 5 and 25 cm (mean 11). The duration--estimated according to patients' history--was 5 to 48 months (mean 17). In 5 patients, durations of up to 30 months had been documented by angiography. A flexible, blunt, motor-driven rotating catheter was introduced through an 8 or 9Fr sheath and rotational angioplasty was performed at low speeds (up to 200 rpm). In 11 of 14 patients in whom this new technique was used as the primary intervention, the occlusions could be successfully reopened. In 2 patients after failure of conventional techniques the rotating catheter could not bypass the preexisting dissections in the same intervention. In 2 of 3 further patients after failure of conventional techniques the occlusions could be successfully reopened in a second intervention after several weeks. In none of the 19 patients did a perforation occur. It is concluded that with the new technique chronic peripheral artery occlusions can be reopened with a high success rate and without the danger of arterial wall perforation. The method can also be used in patients in whom conventional techniques have failed.",Vallbracht C; Liermann D; Prignitz I; Beinborn W; Landgraf H; Paasch C; Roth FJ; Kollath J; Schoop W; Bamberg W; et al.,,1988,The American journal of cardiology,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,15062930,Computerized quantification of carotid artery stenosis using MRA axial images.,"Currently, the North American symptomatic carotid endarterectomy trial, European carotid surgery trial, and common carotid method are used to measure the carotid stenosis for determining candidates for carotid endarterectomy using the projection angiography from different modalities such as digital subtraction angiography, rotational angiography, computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography. A new computerized carotid stenosis measuring system was developed using MR angiography axial image to overcome the drawbacks of conventional carotid stenosis measuring methods, to reduce the variability of inter-observer and intra-observer. The gray-level thresholding is one of the most popular and efficient methods for image segmentation. We segmented the carotid artery and lumen from three-dimensional time-of-flight MRA axial images using gray-level thresholding technique. Using the measured intima-media thickness value of common carotid artery for each case, we separated carotid artery wall from the segmented carotid artery region. After that, the regions of segmented carotid without artery wall were divided into region of blood flow and plaque. The calculation of carotid stenosis degree was performed as follows: carotid stenosis grading = (area measure of plaque/area measure of blood flow region and plaque) * 100%. No previous study has developed the carotid stenosis measuring method using MRA axial image. The new computerized stenosis measuring system has advantage over conventional caliper measuring methods; it will not only greatly increase the speed of stenosis measuring but also reduce the variability between readers. It should also reduce the variability between different institutions.",Kim DY; Park JW,,2004,Magnetic resonance imaging,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,11735327,Retrograde embolism and atherosclerosis development in the human thoracic aorta: are the fluid dynamics explanations valid?,"The mechanisms of atherosclerosis development in the thoracic aorta is miscellaneous and still only partially understood. The marked variability of the sites of deposition of atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta could not be clarified based solely on the risk-factors theory of atherosclerosis. The sites of deposition of atherosclerotic plaques are considered to be affected by blood-flow patterns that cause areas of altered shear stress on the aortic wall. Close relations between protruding aortic plaques (PAP), stroke and peripheral emboli were established. The analysis of PAP distribution and motion to characterize atherogenesis in the human thoracic aorta and the pathogeneses of embolic events was performed. We concluded that protruding aortic plaques and markers of relative aortic flow instability (occurrences of vortices) are predominantly noticed in the human arch and in the descending aorta, whereas the ascending aorta showed lesser prevalence of atheromatosis. Reversal and rotational blood-flow in the thoracic aorta most likely exist in all patients with systemic emboli and mobile protruding aortic atheromas.

Four other animals had similar flaps transplanted onto the soft tissues of the neck by microvascular techniques. All harvested flaps showed periosteal bone production, leading to the following observations: Osteogenesis begins as early as 7 days after grafting; the rate and extent of periosteal osteogenesis is proportional to the vascular supply; bone formation starts in small foci of active osteoblasts that grow and become confluent; and intimate bony periosteal contact is not necessary for periosteal osteogenesis to take place, but it appears to influence the rate and amount of bone formation.",Burstein FD; Canalis RF,,1985,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of,Journal Article,,

The vertical and horizontal diameters significantly increased after RA. The intima-media thickness at the 4 orthogonal sites significantly decreased. There was a significant positive correlation between vertical diameter change and angle (r=0.642, p=0.045), but none between horizontal diameter change and angle. There was no correlation between intima-media thickness change at 0 degrees and angle; however, at 180 degrees there was a tendency to correlation with angle (r=0.602, p=0.066). These data suggest that in cases of angled lesions, the increase in vertical lumen diameter is caused more by ablation of the 180 degrees wall than by that of the 0 degrees wall, which is brought about by guidewire bias toward the vascular wall at 180 degrees.",Oishi Y; Okamoto M; Sueda T; Hashimoto M; Karakawa S; Kambe M,,2002,Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,Evaluation Study; Journal Article,,

ASA had no effect on platelet adherence to a damaged aorta perfused with a suspension of washed platelets in a medium containing 10% red blood cells (RBC); SP was slightly inhibitory at high concentration. When damaged rabbit aortae were everted on a probe and rotated in a suspension of washed platelets to which RBC were added to a packed cell volume of 10%, both ASA and SP inhibited platelet adherence to the damaged vessel wall. When the PCV was 40%, ASA was not inhibitory and SP reduced platelet adherence only at very high concentrations. It is therefore unlikely that, at the concentrations achieved in man, SP exerts an effect on platelet adherence. The different effects of ASA and SP on platelet survival do not appear attributable to their effects on platelet adherence.",Davies JA; Essien E; Cazenave JP; Kinlough-Rathbone RL; Gent M; Mustard JF,,1979,British journal of haematology,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,20589532,Quantitative analysis of bulk flow in image-based hemodynamic models of the carotid bifurcation: the influence of outflow conditions as test case.,"Although flow-driven mechanisms associated with vascular physiopathology also deal with four-dimensional phenomena such as species transport, the majority of the research on the subject focuses primarily on wall shear stress as indicator of disturbed flow. Indeed, the role that bulk flow plays in vascular physiopathology has not been thoroughly investigated, partly because of a lack of descriptors that would be able to reduce the intricacy of arterial hemodynamics. Here, an approach is proposed to investigate, in silico, the bulk flow within the carotid bifurcation. For this purpose, we coupled a three-dimensional model of carotid bifurcation with a lumped model of the downstream vasculature. For the sake of comparison, we also imposed three different fixed flow rate repartitions between the internal and external carotid arteries on the three-dimensional model. The bulk flow was characterized by applying a descriptor of helical motion, the helical flow index (HFI) to the model; the HFI has recently been shown to provide an accurate representation of complex flows. Moreover, a new metric is presented to investigate the vorticity dynamics within the bifurcation. Our results highlight the effectiveness of these metrics in the following contexts: (i) identifying and ranking emerging hemodynamic features and (ii) quantifying the influence of the outflow boundary conditions on the composition of the translational and rotational components of the fluid motion. The metrics applied herein allow for a more comprehensive analysis, which may lead to the development of an instrument to relate the bulk flow to vascular pathophysiological events that involve not only fluid-related forces, but also transport phenomena within blood.",Morbiducci U; Gallo D; Ponzini R; Massai D; Antiga L; Montevecchi FM; Redaelli A,,2010,Annals of biomedical engineering,Journal Article,,

The analysis demonstrates that at higher shear rates, besides linear primary flow in the rotational direction, prominent non-linear secondary flow causes additional fluid circulation in the radial direction. Two parameters, the cone angle and Reynolds number, characterize flow in the viscometer over all ranges of shear rate. Our results indicate that secondary flow causes positional variations in: (i) the velocity gradient, (ii) the direction and magnitude of the wall shear stress at the plate surface, (iii) inter-particle collision frequency, (iv) magnitude and periodicity of normal and shear forces applied during particle-particle interactions, and (v) inter-particle attachment times.

Vectorcardiography was applied to the rat according to orthogonal Takayasu lead system and ""vectorcardiography for small animals"" with a good reproducibility was established. Characteristic vectorcardiogram (VCG) was obtained from 5-month-old SHR, compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WK). Left superior (posterior) deviation of QRS vector usually with ST-T changes was recognized as LVH (Left Ventricular Hypertrophy) pattern of SHR and such corresponded to the pathological findings of the increased heart weight and the increased weight and thickness of the left ventricular wall, and also to the high blood pressure. Macroscopical morphological features of the heart were also studied. Chest roentgenography showed and increased cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) and the protrusion of the left ventricular portion in the posteroanterior cardiac silhouette of SHR. The horizontal view of the chest, cross-sectioned by the apparatus of whole body autoradiography, PMV-cryomicrotome 450 MP, indicated the left anterior orientation of the interventricular septum in rats, as is the case in humans, and the clockwise rotation of the left ventricular cavity in SHR, compared with WK. The coronary arterial wall thickening with narrowed lumen was noted even in the prehypertensive 1-month-old SHR. Such correlated well with the wall thickening of the left ventricle. From these vectorcardiographical and morphological studies on SHR and SHRSP, genetic hypertension was ascertained to be significant not only for cardiac hypertrophy but for the coronary arterial wall thickening, both of which may also enhance the myocardial lesions in SHR, particularly in SHRSP.",Ohtaka M,,1980,Japanese circulation journal,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,9869998,Inferior vena cava-tricuspid annulus isthmus is a critical site of unidirectional block during the induction of common atrial flutter.,"BACKGROUND: Until recently no clinical studies had reported precise right atrium (RA) mapping when performing induction of atrial flutter (AFl). We studied the mode of tachycardia initiation in 16 patients (pts) referred for radiofrequency (RF) AFl ablation. AFl induction was performed at the beginning of the procedure (n = 10), or after previous AFl termination during RF delivery (n = 6). Detailed analysis of AFl initiation was provided by duodecapolar (Halo) and multipolar catheters positioned in the peritricuspidian region at the lateral right atrial wall (LRA), the inferior vena cavatricuspid annulus (IVC-TA) isthmus and the interatrial septum. Induction was obtained during incremental pacing (IAP) (15 pts) or programmed stimulation (1 pt) from the proximal coronary sinus (PCS). RESULTS: Atrial flutter with counterclockwise (CCW) RA rotation was induced in all pts by PCS pacing. During PCS IAP, at long pacing cycle lengths, impulse propagated in a clockwise (CW) direction through the IVC-TA isthmus and then upward at low (L) LRA. This led to a collision at the mid LRA with another wave front propagating in a CCW direction at the septum. IAP from PCS induced a progressive delay of propagation at the IVC-TA isthmus resulting in a prolongation of the PCS-Mid Isthmus interval from 85 +/- 29 to 151 +/- 42 msec. At same pacing cycle lengths (CL), the PCS-HLRA interval was comparatively less prolonged, from 75 +/- 12 to 105 +/- 18 msec, p = 0.0007. This preferential slowing of conduction between PCS and mid isthmus, during IAP from PCS, was associated with a displacement of the zone of collision to the Low LRA. Finally a CW functional block occurred at the IVC-TA isthmus and CCW AFl was induced through a period of transient concealed entrainment. The paced CL required to initiate flutter ranged from 290 to 180 msec and the mean CL of induced atrial flutter was 254 +/- 27 msec. CONCLUSIONS: The IVC-TA isthmus has decremental properties and exhibits wenckebach phenomenon during incremental PCS pacing. Initiation of a counterclockwise flutter by PCS pacing is associated with appearance of a functional unidirectional block at the IVC-TA isthmus.",Poty H; Anselme F; Saoudi N,,1998,Journal of interventional cardiac electrophysiology : an international journal of,Comparative Study; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,3250628,A disk-type apparatus for applying fluid shear stress on cultured endothelial cell.,"To study the effect of fluid shear stress on cultured endothelial cells, we have developed an apparatus for the stress creation, which consists of a stainless steel disk driven by an electric DC motor and a stage to place a culture dish and to adjust the distance between the disk and the dish. When the disk is rotated, a concentric fluid movement occurs in the culture medium in the dish and exerts the shear stress on the endothelial cells cultured on the bottom of the dish. A theoretical analyses concerning the induced concentric flow velocity predicted that when the angular velocity of the disk rotation (omega) is slow enough to maintain a Reynolds' number of the order of 10, the exerted wall shear stress tau w on the endothelial cell monolayer is given for a constant as tau w = mu r omega/d where mu is the viscosity of the medium, d the distance from the plate to the monolayer and r the radial distance from the center of the dish. When omega is varied in a sinusoidal mode tau w also becomes sinusoidal, thus allowing to apply a pulsatile stress. In vitro experiments carried out to examine the validity of the theoretical results, using a suspension of polystyrene as a tracer with the ordinary culture medium and 99% ethanol, revealed excellent agreement of the measured velocity profiles with the predicted ones. The results demonstrated that the present apparatus can create both the steady and pulsatile wall shear stress on the culture cell layer as expected, unless Reynolds' number greatly exceeds the level of 10.",Nomura H; Ishikawa C; Komatsuda T; Ando J; Kamiya A,,1988,Biorheology,Journal Article,,

Grafts were then cultivated for 9 days to enable the maturation of the cytoskeleton, before they were exposed to pulsatile shear stress for 48 hours. A mock circulation simulated the flow patterns and the wall shear forces of the femoral artery. After a 3-hour seeding process, 45% of AHSVEC and 43% of HUVEC were attached to the fibrin matrix, forming a confluent monolayer. After 24 hours of perfusion, a cell loss of 23% in AHSVEC- and of 42% in HUVEC-lined grafts was encountered. In spite of a further cell loss during the following 24 hours of perfusion, the majority of the graft surface was still covered by endothelial cells. Therefore we conclude that fibrin glue is a suitable substrate for the formation of a shear stress-resistant endothelial cell monolayer on polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts.",Zilla P; Fasol R; Preiss P; Kadletz M; Deutsch M; Schima H; Tsangaris S; Groscurth P,,1989,Surgery,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,11372062,Adherence of human saphenous vein endothelial cell monolayers to tissue-engineered biomatrix vascular conduits.,"This study investigates the adherence and retention under in vitro flow conditions of endothelium grown on the luminal surface of 4-mm-internal-diameter, biomatrix vascular conduits. The biomatrix vascular conduits are produced in living animals and consist of a naturally formed extracellular matrix wall incorporating a polyester mesh. We propose that the microarchitecture of the luminal surface may be conducive to endothelial cell (EC) seeding and to the formation of a firmly adherent endothelium without prior treatment of the surface with cell adhesives. ECs were isolated from segments of human saphenous vein and grown to confluence in a culture. Cultured cells were characterized by morphology and immunocytochemistry with anti-CD31, Von Willebrand factor, smooth muscle actin, cytokeratin, and the lectin Ulex Europaeus agglutinin. After culture, ECs were seeded (1 x 10(6) cell/mL) by rotation onto the luminal surface of 20-cm-long, biomatrix vascular conduits (n = 3). The seeded conduits were incubated for 72 h, and at set time points postseeding (1, 24, 48, and 72 h), the morphology, percentage luminal surface cover, and cell density (cell/cm(2)) were determined from en face preparations and histological cross sections. After 72 h in culture, the seeded conduits were subjected to a nonpulsatile flow for 1 h with culture media. A flow rate of 480 mL/min generated physiological-range shear stresses of 12 dyn/cm(2) on the endothelialized surface. After the flow, the conduits were fixed for histology, and the EC morphology and percentage luminal surface cover were determined. Quantification of the extent of luminal surface endothelialization, preflow and postflow, and cell densities at confluence was performed with digital imaging light microscopy and image analysis software. An analysis of the results demonstrated that confluent EC monolayers may be established on the luminal surface of biomatrix vascular conduits within 48 h. The formed endothelium was firmly adherent and was retained under physiological-range flow.",Birchall IE; Field PL; Ketharanathan V,,2001,Journal of biomedical materials research,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

In 17 patients the superficial femoral artery, and in two patients the popliteal artery, was completely occluded. The length of occlusions were between 5 and 25 cm (mean 10.9 cm); the duration (estimated according to patient's history) was 5-48 months (mean 17.2 months). In five patients, durations of up to 30 months had been documented by angiography. A flexible, blunt, motor-driven rotating catheter was introduced over an 8 or 9 F sheet and rotational angioplasty was performed at low speed, up to 200 rpm. In 11/14 patients in whom this new technique was used as the first attempt, the occlusions could be successfully reopened. In two patients after failure of the conventional technique the rotating catheter could not bypass the preexisting dissections in the same intervention. In 2/3 further patients after failure of the conventional technique the occlusions could be successfully reopened in a second intervention after several weeks. In none of our 19 patients did a perforation occur. It is concluded that by using the new technique, chronic peripheral artery occlusions can be reopened with a high success rate and without the danger of vessel wall perforation. The method can also be applied in patients in whom conventional techniques have failed.",Vallbracht C; Schweitzer M; Kress J; Bamberg W; Kollath J; Liermann D; Paasch C; Rauber K; Roth FJ; Prignitz J; et al.,,1988,Zeitschrift fur Kardiologie,English Abstract; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,1527161,Arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries: surgical techniques to avoid complications.,"From June 1984 to November 1990, 109 patients with transposition of the great arteries underwent arterial switch operation. There were 5 deaths, yielding a mortality rate of 4.6%. During this period, modifications of the surgical technique were devised to minimize intra- and postoperative problems, such as bleeding, kinking of the coronary arteries, aortic regurgitation and pulmonary stenosis. The surgical refinements that evolved include (1) a more distal division of the ascending aorta, (2) a punch technique for reimplantation of the coronary arteries in a medially rotated position, approximating the commissure, and superior to the upper border of the sinus of Valsalva, and (3) removal of left coronary ostia by incision down from the transected site to include a button of aortic wall, avoiding the free margin of the aorta and patch enlargement of the neopulmonary artery. Since instituting these refinements: (1) the time consumed for hemostasis after termination of the bypass considerably decreased from 111 +/- 59 to 87 +/- 51 minutes (p less than 0.05), (2) the incidence of kinking of the coronary arteries decreased from 29% (4/14) to 7% (6/88) (p less than 0.05), and (3) the occurrence of aortic insufficiency 1 year after correction was reduced from 36% (5/14) to 8% (5/66) (p less than 0.02). However, the occurrence of pulmonary stenosis with a pressure gradient greater than 30 mmHg did not decrease significantly despite aggressive modifications of surgical techniques, and its incidence in the most recent series of 32 patients was still a high 19%.",Yasui H; Yonenaga K; Kado H; Nakamura Y; Fusazaki N; Tsuruhara Y; Nakashima A; Tominaga R; Kawachi Y; Tokunaga K,,1992,The Journal of cardiovascular surgery,Journal Article,,

Spin-lattice rotating frame relaxation parameters were measured for protons (T1pH) and for carbons (T1pC) at room temperature. Proton relaxation times were shorter for bovine kappa-elastin (T1pH = 1.7 ms) than for bovine elastin (T1pH) = 3.5 ms). Calculation of T1pH showed no differences between human normal and atherosclerotic elastins. T1pC were shorter for bovine kappa-elastin than for bovine elastin. While alpha-carbons of human atherosclerotic elastin had shorter T1pC than normal elastin alpha carbons, carbons from hydrophobic amino acid side chains had longer T1pC for atherosclerotic then for normal elastin. Biochemical studies of aortic wall and purified elastin showed significantly increased content of lipids (atherosclerotic 67.7 mmol/g elastin, control 54.7 mmol/g elastin) and calcium (atherosclerotic 38.3 mmol/g elastin, control 19.6 mmol/g elastin). Changes in relaxation parameter values may be caused by the structural and biochemical changes in human elastin. Increased mobility of polypeptide chains as based on the model kappa-elastin studies is caused by the action of elastase. Restriction of mobility is expected to be caused by the accumulation of lipids and calcium.",Tarnawski R; Tarnawski R; Grobelny J,,1995,Atherosclerosis,Comparative Study; Journal Article,,

In 1 dog, ligation of an aberrant, perforating branch of the cranial epigastric artery resulted in necrosis of 53% of the flap area. The cranial superficial epigastric axial pattern flaps have potential application for closure of skin defects within their arc of rotation and may be particularly useful for closure of large defects on the ventral aspect of the thorax.

rotating_wall,11180180,Color duplex sonographic findings in human vertebral arteries during cervical rotation.,"PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to determine whether vertebral artery blood flow velocity changes during contralateral cervical rotation, to determine the extent of rotation necessary to affect the velocity, and to find direct evidence of stretching or compression of the vertebral arteries during cervical rotation. METHODS: Color duplex sonography was used to measure the blood flow velocities and diameters of the vertebral arteries in 20 patients. Measurements were taken with the patients' heads in the neutral position and at 10 degrees increments of contralateral neck rotation (determined using a cervical range of motion goniometer) to the end-range. RESULTS: The data showed no significant change in the mean blood flow velocity for the entire study population during cervical rotation. However, there were marked changes in the blood flow velocities in 7 vertebral arteries toward the end-range of rotation. No arteries displayed any evidence of major stretching of the arterial walls, although localized compression of 2 arteries was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that vertebral arteries are usually unaffected by contralateral cervical rotation and that Doppler sonography may provide an indirect assessment of mechanical stresses to the arterial wall.",Haynes M; Milne N,,2001,Journal of clinical ultrasound : JCU,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,1767057,[Intravascular echography in interventional vascular radiology].,"Intravascular US studies were performed with a 20 MHz rotating transducer mounted on a long flexible shaft in 14 patients undergoing interventional vascular procedures--i.e. percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), atherectomy with a Simpson device, and Palmaz stent placement. Intravascular US was used immediately before the procedure to assess the lesion characteristics and during and after the procedure to verify its results. In PTA, intravascular US clearly shows the fracture of the plaque, its separation from the medial layer, and the total longitudinal extension of the intimal flaps. Palmaz stents are clearly shown and their correct positioning on the arterial wall is therefore precisely evaluated. After atherectomy, intravascular US shows the changes in wall thickness and identifies the areas where more tissue needs to be removed. Intravascular US appears to be a very promising technique for monitoring and directing revascularization procedures by helping select the correct interventional procedure. The initial limitation of use of intravascular ultrasound catheters to straight arterial segments has been resolved by the development of over-the-wire catheters.

rotating_wall,8516460,[2D TOF angio-MR of the thoraco-abdominal aorta. Technique and clinical applications].,"The diagnostic role of Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) was investigated in the study of the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Thirty-two patients with different conditions were examined: the thoracic aorta was affected in 7 cases (3 aneurysms, 2 dissections, 2 tumors) and the abdominal aorta in 25 cases (21 aneurysms, 3 stenoses and 1 dissection). Moreover, 2 kinkings and 1 dextroposition of the thoracic aorta were observed as occasional findings, together with 15 abdominal aorta kinking cases. A 1.5-T superconductive magnet (Magnetom, Siemens) with circular polarization body coil and the 2D TOF (FL 18 degrees, TR 30 ms, TE 10 ms, ST 5 mm, 1-mm overlap) technique were used. The images acquired on the coronal and sagittal or parasagittal planes were rotated from -45 degrees to 45 degrees and from 60 degrees to 120 degrees during post-processing, according to MIP. Digital angiography was the gold standard in all cases, angiography and CT were the gold standards for aneurysms, and surgery for the lesions reaching the thoracic aorta. The 2D TOF technique allowed excellent visualization of both the thoracic and the abdominal aorta. In thoracic aorta conditions, MRA always identified aneurysms and assessed their relationship to epiaortic branchings. Moreover, MRA identified 2 cases of thoracic aorta dissection. In one case (1/2) MRA failed to depict aortic wall infiltration by tumor. In 21 abdominal aorta aneurysms, MRA always correctly demonstrated both the extent of the aneurysm and its relationships to renal and iliac arteries. Moreover, the thrombotic aneurysmal component was demonstrated, together with left renal vein course, which was retroaortic in 4 cases. Abnormal course, stenoses (2 cases) and dissection of the abdominal aorta were always identified by MRA.",Iezzi A; Tartaro A; Magarelli N; Guidotti S; Tonni G; Carriero A,,1993,La Radiologia medica,English Abstract; Journal Article,,

Prior to coronary arteriography, left ventricular segmental wall motion was determined during ventricular pacing and the first postextrasystolic beat following an extrasystole. The postextrasystole was induced at an interval calculated to occur at a time where ventricular preload was identical to the regular paced beat (isolength interval). The left ventricular wall was divided into six segments, each subscribing one area of the ventriculogram, and correction for rotation during systole was made. Of 48 segments, 21 were considered ""jeopardized,"" due to greater than 70% reduction in cross-sectional lumen of the serving coronary arteries. Fifteen of these 21 responded to PESP, increasing their segmental area ejection fraction from 44 +/- 5 (paced ""normal"" beat) to 56 +/- 6 (postextrasystolic beat) (p less than 0.05). Following surgical revascularization, these segments showed an improvement in their baseline area ejection fraction from 44 +/- 6 to 58 +/- 5 (p less than 0.05). Six jeopardized segments that failed to respond to PESP prior to revascularization showed functional deterioration after revascularization. The 27 non-jeopardized segments (which were not revascularized) also showed functional improvement, suggesting improved collateral flow. This study demonstrates that isolength postextrasystolic potentiation obtained with a standardized pacing protocol may be used to predict the potential for improvement in cardiac function following surgical revascularization. Our results also show that lack of PESP predicts loss of left ventricular myocardial function following revascularization.",Stanton MW; Cooper MW; Voda J; Lust R Jr; Lutherer LO; Feola M,,1986,Catheterization and cardiovascular diagnosis,Journal Article,,

The system consisted of a high-speed rotating impeller, placed within the center of a self-expandable basket. Preformed radiopaque emboli were introduced via the right external jugular vein. In nine tests in five dogs, a single embolus was launched after the right pulmonary artery had been balloon occluded and the impeller-basket catheter had been positioned into the left pulmonary artery. Seven of nine emboli were completely fragmented, each within less than 10 s. In two tests, performed in two different dogs, the catheter was positioned after complete embolization of the left pulmonary artery. In both cases, the central pulmonary arteries could be fully, and the segmental arteries partly, recanalized. Mobility of the system within the pulmonary arteries was limited. There was no evidence of wall damage at the rotation site of the impeller. Free serum hemoglobin did not increase after treatment. We conclude that the device can be safely operated in the left pulmonary artery system of dogs. It causes no significant hemolysis, and is able to accomplish rapid recanalization of the central arteries. Due to limited steerability, occluded side branches cannot be treated consistently.",Schmitz-Rode T; Vorwerk D; Günther RW; Biesterfeld S,,1993,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,Journal Article,,

rotating_wall,4135041,Regional variation in the permeability of rat thoracic aorta.,"The permeability and ultrastructure of the intercostal orifices and interostial regions of rat thoracic aorta have been compared in the present study. The ostial regions consist of two different portions, an annulus and an inflow tract, the latter being continuous with the intercostal artery. The wall of the inflow tract has a sharp bend, demarcating inner and outer portions. Faint blueing of the lateral portions of aortic annuli is visible from 3(1/2) to 4(1/2) hours after injection of Evans blue dye and is no longer apparent at 5(1/2) hours, when there is diffuse discoloration of the thoracic aorta. Only the annuli are labeled by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 1(1/2) to 3(1/2) minutes after intravenous injection. There is more extensive and progressively heavier labeling of annuli and inner halves of the inflow tracts between 5 to 12 minutes. HRP is transported across aortic endothelium within micropinocytotic vesicles. Intercellular endothelial clefts do not appear to be directly permeated from the lumen through their junctions for a period of at least 3(1/2) minutes. The present observations preclude an assessment of the penetration of the junctions by HRP at later intervals. No appreciable differences are observed in the mode of transport of peroxidase through the more permeable endothelium of the annulus and less permeable endothelium of inflow tract and interostial regions. Observations made on tissues exposed to colloidal lanthanum, and on specimens stained en bloc with uranyl acetate and subjected to a combination of rotation-tilting, fail to demonstrate appreciable differences in the ultrastructure of the endothelial cell junctions of intercostal orifices and interostial regions. Since morphologic differences do not seem to account for the greater permeability of annular regions, the role of hemodynamic forces is considered.

The anatomy of the masseter muscle, with particular emphasis on its blood supply, was studied using plain and coloured resin injected dissections and a series of digital subtraction angiograms and external carotid arteriograms. Both techniques were demonstrated to be reliable and effective means of anatomical investigation of blood vessels. The vascular anatomy of the masseter muscle and the anatomical and angiological results as well as a case report are described. The masseter muscle, when used as an inferiorly based flap, provides the necessary bulk for reconstruction of moderate size defects in the lateral border of the tongue, posterior floor of the mouth, retromolar trigone, anterior tonsillar pillars and lateral pharyngeal wall. Although the masseter muscle has small dimensions, it offers a reliable method of reconstruction in selected defects without the disadvantages of cosmetic and functional loss.",Marinho LH; Shanahan DA; Langdon JD; Sinnatamby CS,,1991,International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,8838157,The dorsal mesocardium and development of the pulmonary veins in human embryos.,"Pulmonary vein development was studied using serial histologic sections of normal human embryos of Carnegie stages 11 to 15. Three-dimensional models were created in the program Swivel 3D on a Macintosh IIfx computer. The position of the mesocardium was found to be an important factor in the placement of the vein. Since the vein grows through a gap in the myoepicardium of the dorsal atrial wall created by the mesocardium, the vein can only grow where the mesocardium is positioned. Displacement of the initially median pulmonary vein ostium into the left atrium appeared to be caused by the formation of the left valve of the sinus venosus. This latter structure displaces the mesocardium to the left from stage 14 and later, carrying the vein to the left as well. The subsequent development of several pulmonary veins from the original single pulmonary vein occurred later, as the apex of the heart rotated to the left and brought the left atrium into a dorsal midline position. The study shows that correct placement of the pulmonary vein in the left atrium is the consequence of the successful execution of a sequence of developmental events in cardiogenesis.",Bliss DF 2nd; Hutchins GM,,1995,The American journal of cardiovascular pathology,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,2779189,A preliminary theoretical study of arterial pressure perturbations under shock acceleration.,"The artero-venous system is often stressed by accelerative perturbation, not only during exceptional performances, but also in normal life. For example, when the body is subject to fast pressure changes, accelerative perturbations combined with a change in hydrostatic pressure could have severe effects on the circulation. In such cases a preliminary mathematical inquiry, whose results allow qualitative evaluation of the perturbation produced is useful. Pressure variations are studied in this work when the body is subjected both to rectilinear and rotational movements as well as posture change. The dominant modes of the hemodynamic oscillations are emphasized and the numerical simulation results presented. The artery model used for simulation is obviously simplified with respect to the anatomical structure of an artery. Nevertheless, behavior of the main arteries (like the common carotid and aorta) can be approximately described, choosing suitable model parameters. The frequency of blood oscillations strictly depends on the Young modulus of the arterial wall. This connection could be employed for new clinical tests on the state of the arteries.",Belardinelli E; Ursino M; Iemmi E,,1989,Journal of biomechanical engineering,Journal Article,,

The samples were imaged with a 64-element array and a mechanically rotating US transducer at 20 MHz. The mean thickness of the intimal and medial layer was measured with electronic calipers followed by histopathologic and micromorphometric analysis. Morphometric correlation for intima showed r = 0.64 for the electronic and r = 0.58 for the mechanical US device. The correlation between ultrasonic and histologic measurement of medial thickness in normal and diseased specimens was r = 0.79 for the multielement and r = 0.76 for the mechanical transducer. In conclusion, multielement array transducers are equivalent to mechanically driven probes in the quantitative assessment of peripheral arterial wall layers.

The external oblique musculocutaneous flap is now considered a reliable option, with segmental blood supply from the posterior intercostal arteries. We report a 57-year-old man with local recurrence of breast tumor after external beam therapy. We faced a difficult challenge in performing reconstruction because of (1) several previous operations that used most of the usual options and (2) the absence of recipient vessels for microsurgery. We performed an external-internal oblique musculocutaneous flap with a reverse blood supply from the lateral branches of the inferior epigastric artery.

An analysis of the line shape shows a composite free induction decay (FID) consisting of a low amplitude (3-7%) fast decaying component (T2 approximately 20 microseconds) and a slow decaying one (T2 > 1 ms). The fast component is identified as the protons of the collagen macromolecules. The second moment computed from the experimental fast component of the FID is in agreement with published studies examining the motional characteristics of collagen by multinuclear NMR employing spin labeling. A theoretical second moment is computed for the collagen macromolecular backbone from the atomic positions in the superhelix.

The study was carried out on 25 aortobifemoral segments presenting typical obliterating arteriosclerotic lesions. The equipment consists of a flexible probe whose distal end was represented by a screened helical cutter and whose proximal end by an inlet and washing chamber. At the centre of these chambers and of the probe, a steel tube sets the cutter rotating at an adjustable speed. Good recanalisation was achieved in all vasal segments treated without damaging the vessel's wall.

Plain x-ray disclosed a tumor shadow extending from the pathologic fracture of the distal portion of the femur to the center of the diaphysis. MRIs showed a broad lesion and hematoma, and invasion to the femoral vascular bundle was suspected. Angiograms revealed vascularization coincidental to the tumor, and an irregular vascular wall of the femoral artery, which was shifted posteriorly. After consultation with the patient and her family, rotation plasty was performed. The sciatic nerve was isolated and preserved; major vessels were sectioned proximally and distally because of tumor tissue invasion to the femoral artery and vein. After wide excision of the tumor, the leg was rotated outward 180 degrees, and osteosynthesis was performed between the remaining femur and the tibia, followed by microsurgical anastomosis of vessels. Five years postoperatively, no local recurrence or metastasis has been observed. The patient has excellent functional recovery without pain, and no other complications.",Otsuka T; Okuda T; Sekiya I; Tsuji H; Matsui N; Nishi G,,1998,Journal of reconstructive microsurgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,10776823,Equations for estimating muscle fiber stress in the left ventricular wall.,"Left ventricular muscle fiber stress is an important parameter in cardiac energetics. Hence, we developed equations for estimating regional fiber stresses in rotationally symmetric chambers, and equatorial and apical fiber stresses in prolate spheroidal chambers. The myocardium was modeled as a soft incompressible material embedding muscle fibers that support forces only in their longitudinal direction. A thin layer of muscle fibers then contributes with a pressure increment determined by the fiber stress and curvature. The fiber curvature depends on the orientation of the fibers, which varies continuously across the wall. However, by assuming rotational symmetry about the long axis of the ventricle and including a longitudinal force balance, we obtained equations where fiber stress is completely determined by the principal curvatures of the middle wall surface, wall thickness, and cavity pressure. The equations were validated against idealized prolate spheroidal chambers, whose wall thicknesses are such that the fiber stress is uniform from the equator to the apex. Because the apex is free to rotate, the resultant moment about the long axis of the LV must be zero. By using this constraint together with our fiber-stress equations, we were able to estimate a muscle fiber orientation distribution across the wall that was in qualitative agreement with published measurements.",Rabben SI; Irgens F; Angelsen B,,1999,Heart and vessels,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,15519186,Red blood cell aggregation during cardiopulmonary bypass: a pathogenic cofactor in endothelial cell activation?,"OBJECTIVE: The bio-incompatibility of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit and the use of artificial colloids trigger massive defense reaction that involves endothelial cells and several blood cells: platelets, neutrophils, monocytes, red blood cells (RBC) and lymphocytes. Investigating the effects on RBC aggregation and endothelial cells activation, the present study addresses two different prime solutions commonly used in the clinical practice. METHODS: RBC aggregation was measured by means of Laser-assisted Optical Rotation Cell Analyzer, in an in vitro study designed to mimic the human blood-material interactions during extracorporeal circulation. A clinical study investigating endothelial activation was conducted in 20 patients undergoing elective coronary bypass surgery, randomly assigned for CPB using two different priming solutions: HAES-steril 6% (HES 200/0.5) and Voluven 6% (HES 130/0.4). RESULTS: Circulation trough a Chandler loop of HES-blood mixes altered significantly RBC aggregability. The use of HES 130/0.4 resulted in marked decrease in RBC aggregation (aggregation index (AI) before and after circulation was 23.5+/-3.8 and 18+/-2.9, respectively), no significant differences being found when compared with Ringer's lactate group. The use of HES 200/0.5 resulted in better maintained RBC aggregation (AI 39.7+/-5.9 and 29.7+/-4.7 before and after circulation, respectively). The AI measured for the whole blood (control) sample was 61.9+/-4.9 before circulation, and 58.1+/-4 after. Markers of endothelial activation (von Willebrand factor (vWF), thrombomodulin (TM), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and E-selectin) significantly increased during CPB. Differences between HES treatment groups were evident post-bypass. While the markers of endothelial activation returned to baseline in HES 200/0.5 group, HES 130/0.4 was associated on the first post-operative day with further increase of vWF and tPA. CONCLUSION: RBC aggregation significantly drooped as consequence of blood dilution and blood-material interaction. We reason that low RBC aggregation added to plasma viscosity reduction and non-physiologic flow conditions during extracorporeal circulation are important factors contributing to loss of shear stress at the venous endothelial wall. The loss of shear stress triggers complex signaling leading to endothelial activation. Additional fundamental research is needed in order to verify the hypothesis introduced by the present study. Characterizing the impact of rheologic parameters on endothelial function could prove to be valuable in patients undergoing CPB.",Morariu AM; Gu YJ; Huet RC; Siemons WA; Rakhorst G; Oeveren WV,,2004,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European,"Clinical Trial; Comparative Study; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,12925625,The position of the aorta relative to the spine: a comparison of patients with and without idiopathic scoliosis.,"BACKGROUND: There is little information documenting the relationship of the aorta to the thoracic scoliotic spine. Recent studies have suggested that the ends of screws placed during an anterior spinal arthrodesis, and pedicle screws used for the treatment of right thoracic scoliosis, may be in proximity to the aorta. The purpose of this study was to analyze the anatomical relationship between the aorta and the spine in a comparison of patients with idiopathic right thoracic scoliosis and patients with a normal spine. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with a right thoracic curve and forty-three with a normal straight spine were studied. Radiographs were analyzed to determine the Cobb angle, the apex of the curve, and the apical vertebral rotation for the patients with scoliosis. Axial magnetic resonance images from the fourth thoracic vertebra to the third lumbar vertebra at the midvertebral body level were used to measure the distance from the aorta to the closest point of the vertebral body cortex, the distance from the posterior edge of the aorta to the spinal canal, and the aorta-vertebral angle. RESULTS: No differences were found between the groups with respect to age or sex distribution. For the scoliosis and normal groups, boys had greater average vertebral body width and depth for all levels than did girls (p < 0.05). For the scoliosis group, the most common apical vertebra was the eighth thoracic vertebra, the average coronal curve measurement was 55.2 degrees, and the average apical rotation was 17.3 degrees. The average distance from the aortic wall to the vertebral body cortex at the apex of the curve was greater in the patients with scoliosis (4.0 mm) than at similar levels in the normal group (2.5 mm) (p < 0.05). The distance from the posterior aspect of the aorta to the anterior aspect of the spinal canal was less in the scoliosis group (11.1 mm) than in the normal group (19.2 mm) for the fifth to the twelfth thoracic level (p < 0.05). The aorta was positioned more laterally and posteriorly adjacent to the vertebral body at the fifth to the twelfth thoracic level in patients with scoliosis compared with that in normal patients as reflected in a smaller aorta-vertebral angle (p < 0.05). With an increasing coronal Cobb angle in the thoracic curve and apical vertebral rotation, the aorta was positioned more laterally and posteriorly (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In patients with right thoracic idiopathic scoliosis, the aorta is positioned more laterally and posteriorly relative to the vertebral body compared with that in patients without spinal deformity.",Sucato DJ; Duchene C,,2003,The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

The aim is to compare different types of 3D and two-dimensional (2D) osteoblastic culture. ROS17/2.8 cells are cultured in a bioreactor (rotating-wall vessel) or in two kinds of control (3D petri dish, 3D Percoll) and on two types of microcarrier (Cytodex 3 and Biosilon). Growth and morphology are determined by cell count and SEM, and differentiation is determined by dosage of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and northern blots (ALP and osteocalcin (OC)). SEM shows that Biosilon microcarriers are the best substrate. Proliferation in the RWV and 3D petri dish is still in the exponential phase, whereas growth in the 2D culture reaches a plateau after eight days of culture. ALP activity and the ALP and OC mRNA levels are similar at day 8 for both the RWV and 3D petri dish. However, at day 10, cells are more differentiated in the RWV. The study shows that osteoblasts are both proliferate and differentiate in 3D structures. A BrDU immunocytochemical approach shows that only the cells in the periphery of the aggregates proliferate. Therefore the bioreactor may be a suitable tissue culture model for investigation of growth and differentiation processes in tissue engineering.",Granet C; Laroche N; Vico L; Alexandre C; Lafage-Proust MH,,1998,Medical & biological engineering & computing,Comparative Study; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,27738068,Cryoballoon ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation: feasibility and safety of left atrial roof ablation with generation of conduction block in addition to antral pulmonary vein isolation.,"AIMS: Although the generation of linear lesions by ablation improves success rates in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), the procedure has been considered unsuitable for cryoablation balloon catheter technologies. We developed a technique for linear ablations, using second-generation cryoballoon technology. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a single-arm, prospective study in 76 patients with persistent AF treated consecutively at our centre. Cryoablation was performed using a 28 mm second-generation cryoballoon. The first cryoenergy application was performed in close proximity to the position during isolation of the left superior pulmonary vein (PV). Sequential overlapping freezes were applied along the left atrial (LA) roof by slight clockwise rotation of the sheath in combination with slight retraction of the sheath and incremental advancement of the cryoballoon, until reaching the original position for right superior PV isolation. The acute endpoint was the creation of a roofline, defined as complete conduction block across the LA roof >120 ms and ascending activation across the posterior LA wall. Acute success in roofline generation was achieved in 88% of patients, applying on average five (median 4-6) freezes with nadir temperature of -40°C (-36 to -44°C). In five patients, conduction block could not be achieved. No phrenic nerve injuries occurred during roofline generation. CONCLUSION: Generation of linear roofline lesions is possible with the second-generation cryoballoon. The technique can be used in combination with PV isolation to treat persistent AF with good acute success rates, short procedure times, and acceptable safety concerns. If validated by further studies, the method would be an appealing alternative to radiofrequency ablation techniques. The Author 2016.

rotating_wall,11425056,Saphenoperitoneal anastomosis for resistant ascites in patients with cirrhosis.,"BACKGROUND: Restriction of salt intake and diuretics combined with repeated paracentesis has been the mainstay of managing longstanding ascites. Peritoneal-venous shunts have been employed in refractory ascites but are not without complication. We evaluated an autologous reversed segment of proximal long saphenous vein anastomosed to the peritoneum in management of patients with resistant ascites. METHODS: Eleven patients (8 male, median age 48 years, range 37 to 68) with tense refractory ascites associated with cirrhosis of the liver and portal hypertension underwent saphenous vein-peritoneal anastomosis by rotating the proximal vein cephalad which was anastomosed to peritoneum in the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. Ten of 11 procedures were performed under general anesthetic. RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality was 1 patient. Morbidity included transient hepatic encephalopathy in 4 (36%), minor wound hemorrhage in 3 (27%), fluid leakage in 7 (64%), and wound infection in 7 (64%). Hospital stay (median) was 16 days (range 11 to 23). In the short term (median of 9 months) significant reduction in body weight and abdominal girth was seen in 9 (90%), 6 (60%) were not on diuretics while 3 (30%) continued to remain on reduced doses of diuretic. Furthermore, 7 (70%) did not require paracentesis. At 2-year follow-up, 5 (45%) patients had died and 3 were lost to follow-up. The remaining 3 were all in active employment, 1 was off diuretics, and 2 were on reduced doses. All 3 patients maintained reduced body weights and abdominal girths compared with preoperative values. CONCLUSIONS: Saphenous-peritoneal anastomosis appears a simple, safe, and effective method of achieving long-term control of refractory ascites. The use of a biological shunt is an added advantage over prosthetic shunts for drainage of ascitic fluid.",Deen KI; de Silva AP; Jayakody M; de Silva HJ,,2001,American journal of surgery,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,10351971,Rate-dependent conduction block of the crista terminalis in patients with typical atrial flutter: influence on evaluation of cavotricuspid isthmus conduction block.,"BACKGROUND: The crista terminalis (CT) has been identified as the posterior boundary of typical atrial flutter (AFL) in the lateral wall (LW) of the right atrium (RA). To study conduction properties across the CT, rapid pacing was performed at both sides of the CT after bidirectional conduction block was achieved in the cavotricuspid isthmus by radiofrequency catheter ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 22 patients (aged 61+/-7 years) with AFL (cycle length, 234+/-23 ms), CT was identified during AFL by double electrograms recorded between the LW and posterior wall (PW). After the ablation procedure, decremental pacing trains were delivered from 600 ms to 2-to-1 local capture at the LW and PW or coronary sinus ostium (CSO). At least 5 bipolar electrograms were recorded along the CT from the high to the low atrium next to the inferior vena cava. No double electrograms were recorded during sinus rhythm in that area. Complete transversal conduction block all along the CT (detected by the appearance of double electrograms at all recording sites and craniocaudal activation sequence on the side opposite to the pacing site) was observed in all patients during pacing from the PW or CSO (cycle length, 334+/-136 ms), but it was fixed in only 4 patients. During pacing from the LW, complete block appeared at a shorter pacing cycle length (281+/-125 ms; P<0.01) and was fixed in 2 patients. In 3 patients, complete block was not achieved. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest the presence of rate-dependent transversal conduction block at the crista terminalis in patients with typical AFL. Block is usually observed at longer pacing cycle lengths with PW pacing than with LW pacing. This difference may be a critical determinant of the counterclockwise rotation of typical AFL.",Arenal A; Almendral J; Alday JM; Villacastín J; Ormaetxe JM; Sande JL; Perez-Castellano N; Gonzalez S; Ortiz M; Delcán JL,,1999,Circulation,Clinical Trial; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,10397835,Characterization of bimodal cell death of insect cells in a rotating-wall vessel and shaker flask.,"In previous publications, we reported the benefits of a high-aspect rotating-wall vessel (HARV) over conventional bioreactors for insect-cell cultivation in terms of reduced medium requirements and enhanced longevity. To more fully understand the effects that HARV cultivation has on longevity, the present study characterizes the mode and kinetics of Spodoptera frugiperda cell death in this quiescent environment relative to a shaker-flask control. Data from flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy show a greater accumulation of apoptotic cells in the HARV culture, by a factor of at least 2 at the end of the cultivation period. We present a kinetic model of growth and bimodal cell death. The model is unique for including both apoptosis and necrosis, and further, transition steps within the two pathways. Kinetic constants reveal that total cell death is reduced in the HARV and the accumulation of apoptotic cells in this vessel results from reduced depletion by lysis and secondary necrosis. The ratio of early apoptotic to necrotic cell formation is found independent of cultivation conditions. In the model, apoptosis is only well represented by an integral term, which may indicate its dependence on accumulation of some factor over time; in contrast, necrosis is adequately represented with a first-order term. Cell-cycle analysis shows the percent of tetraploid cells gradually decreases during cultivation in both vessels. For example, between 90% and 70% viability, tetraploid cells in the HARV drop from 43 +/- 1% to 24 +/- 4%. The data suggests the tetraploid phase as the likely origin for apoptosis in our cultures. Possible mechanisms for these changes in bimodal cell death are discussed, including hydrodynamic forces, cell-cell interactions, waste accumulation, and mass transport. These studies may benefit insect-cell cultivation by increasing our understanding of cell death in culture and providing a means for further enhancing culture longevity.

We used cardiovascular MR to understand the pathophysiology better by examining the links between 3-dimensional flow abnormalities, aortic function, and aortic dilation. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 142 subjects underwent cardiovascular MR (mean age, 40 years; 95 with BAV, 47 healthy volunteers). Patients with BAV had predominantly abnormal right-handed helical flow in the ascending aorta, larger ascending aortas (18.3±3.3 versus 15.2±2.2 mm/m²; P<0.001), and higher rotational (helical) flow (31.7±15.8 versus 2.9±3.9 mm²/s; P<0.001), systolic flow angle (23.1°±12.5° versus 7.0°±4.6°; P<0.001), and systolic wall shear stress (0.85±0.28 versus 0.59±0.17 N/m²; P<0.001) compared with healthy volunteers. BAV with right-handed flow and right-non coronary cusp fusion (n=31) showed more severe flow abnormalities (rotational flow, 38.5±16.5 versus 27.8±12.4 mm²/s; P<0.001; systolic flow angle, 29.4°±10.9° versus 19.4°±11.4°; P<0.001; in-plane wall shear stress, 0.64±0.23 versus 0.47±0.22 N/m²; P<0.001) and larger aortas (19.5±3.4 versus 17.5±3.1 mm/m²; P<0.05) than right-left cusp fusion (n=55). Patients with BAV with normal flow patterns had similar aortic dimensions and wall shear stress to healthy volunteers and younger patients with BAV showed abnormal flow patterns but no aortic dilation, both further supporting the importance of flow pattern in the pathogenesis of aortic dilation. Aortic function measures (distensibility, aortic strain, and pulse wave velocity) were similar across all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Flow abnormalities may be a major contributor to aortic dilation in BAV. Fusion type affects the severity of flow abnormalities and may allow better risk prediction and selection of patients for earlier surgical intervention.",Bissell MM; Hess AT; Biasiolli L; Glaze SJ; Loudon M; Pitcher A; Davis A; Prendergast B; Markl M; Barker AJ; Neubauer S; Myerson SG,aorta; bicuspid aortic valve; cardiac MRI; vascular function; wall shear stress,2013,Circulation.

This review will focus on the current knowledge of the use of stem cells and specialized cells for tissue engineering under simulated microgravity conditions. We will report on recent advancements in the ability to construct 3D aggregates from various cell types using devices originally created to prepare for spaceflights such as the random positioning machine (RPM), the clinostat, or the NASA-developed rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, to engineer various tissues such as preliminary vessels, eye tissue, bone, cartilage, multicellular cancer spheroids, and others from different cells. In addition, stem cells had been investigated under microgravity for the purpose to engineer adipose tissue, cartilage, or bone. Recent publications have discussed different changes of stem cells when exposed to microgravity and the relevant pathways involved in these biological processes. Tissue engineering in microgravity is a new technique to produce organoids, spheroids, or tissues with and without scaffolds. These 3D aggregates can be used for drug testing studies or for coculture models. Multicellular tumor spheroids may be interesting for radiation experiments in the future and to reduce the need for in vivo experiments.

After thrombus induction and following each treatment, comparisons were made between angioscopy and angiography for the detection of thrombus and subintimal dissection. Angioscopic images were scored in a blinded fashion for lining, protruding, or occlusive thrombus (class 1,2, or 3) as well as estimated wall coverage by thrombus. Angiograms were studied for percent diameter stenosis and the presence of flaps. Following external forceps crush injury of 18 arteries, two hour occlusion, and injection of thrombin, mean angiographic stenosis was 66%, thrombus coverage by angioscopy was 81%, and mean angioscopy class was 2.5. Following PRT, stenosis decreased to 27% (p less than 0.008), thrombus coverage was reduced to 49% (p less than 0.02), and angioscopy class dropped to 2.0 (p less than 0.07). After t-PA treatment, these values were further reduced to 25% (p = NS), 26% (p less than 0.02), and 1.3 (p less than 0.008), respectively. In comparison to angiography, subintimal dissection (seen as flaps) and thrombus (lining, protruding, or occlusive) were present significantly more often by angioscopy (p less than 0.001). It is concluded that PRT results in significant thrombolysis, apparent by angiography and angioscopy. Follow-up t-PA can produce additional, incremental thrombolysis, apparent only by angioscopy. A beneficial role for t-PA following mechanical thrombolysis is suggested by this model.

rotating_wall,36922940,Biofilm formation is correlated with low nutrient and simulated microgravity conditions in a Burkholderia isolate from the ISS water processor assembly.,"The International Space Station (ISS) Water Processor Assembly (WPA) experiences intermittent dormancy in the WPA wastewater tank during water recycling events which promotes biofilm formation within the system. In this work we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of nutrient limitation on bacterial growth and biofilm formation under microgravity in support of biofilm mitigation efforts in exploration water recovery systems. A representative species of bacteria that is commonly cultured from the ISS WPA was cultured in an WPA influent water ersatz formulation tailored for microbiological studies. An isolate of Burkholderia contaminans was cultured under a simulated microgravity (SμG) treatment in a vertically rotating high-aspect rotating vessel (HARV) to create the low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment on a rotating wall vessel (RWV), with a rotating control (R) in the horizontal plane at the predetermined optimal rotation per minute (rpm) speed of 20. Over the course of the growth curve, the bacterial culture in ersatz media was harvested for bacterial counts, and transcriptomic and nutrient content analyses. The cultures under SμG treatment showed a transcriptomic signature indicative of nutrient stress and biofilm formation as compared to the R control treatment. Further analysis of the WPA ersatz over the course of the growth curve suggests that the essential nutrients of the media were consumed faster in the early stages of growth for the SμG treatment and thus approached a nutrient limited growth condition earlier than in the R control culture. The observed limited nutrient response may serve as one element to explain a moderate enhancement of adherent biofilm formation in the SμG treatment after 24 h. While nutrients levels can be modulated, one implication of this investigation is that biofilm mitigation in the ISS environment could benefit from methods such as mixing or the maintenance of minimum flow within a dormant water system in order to force convection and offset the response of microbes to the secondary effects of microgravity.",Diaz A; Dixit AR; Khodadad CL; Hummerick ME; Justiano-Velez YA; Li W; O'Rourke A,Burkholderia; International space station (ISS); Nutrients; Simulated microgravity; Transcriptomics; Water processor assembly (WPA),2023,Biofilm,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,37904089,Super-resolution deep learning reconstruction at coronary computed tomography angiography to evaluate the coronary arteries and in-stent lumen: an initial experience.,"A super-resolution deep learning reconstruction (SR-DLR) algorithm trained using data acquired on the ultrahigh spatial resolution computed tomography (UHRCT) has the potential to provide better image quality of coronary arteries on the whole-heart, single-rotation cardiac coverage on a 320-detector row CT scanner. However, the advantages of SR-DLR at coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) have not been fully investigated. The present study aimed to compare the image quality of the coronary arteries and in-stent lumen between SR-DLR and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). We prospectively enrolled 70 patients (median age, 69 years; interquartile range [IQR], 59-75 years; 50 men) who underwent CCTA using a 320-detector row CT scanner between January and August 2022. The image noise in the ascending aorta, left atrium, and septal wall of the ventricle was measured, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in the proximal coronary arteries were calculated. Of the twenty stents, stent strut thickness and luminal diameter were quantitatively evaluated. The image noise on SR-DLR was significantly lower than that on MBIR (median 22.1 HU; IQR, 19.3-24.9 HU vs. 27.4 HU; IQR, 24.2-31.2 HU, p < 0.01), whereas the SNR (median 16.3; IQR, 11.8-21.8 vs. 13.7; IQR, 9.9-18.4, p = 0.01) and CNR (median 24.4; IQR, 15.5-30.2 vs. 19.2; IQR, 14.1-23.2, p < 0.01) on SR-DLR were significantly higher than that on MBIR. Stent struts were significantly thinner (median, 0.68 mm; IQR, 0.61-0.78 mm vs. 0.81 mm; IQR, 0.72-0.96 mm, p < 0.01) and in-stent lumens were significantly larger (median, 1.84 mm; IQR, 1.65-2.26 mm vs. 1.52 mm; IQR, 1.28-2.25 mm, p < 0.01) on SR-DLR than on MBIR. Although further large-scale studies using invasive coronary angiography as the reference standard, comparative studies with UHRCT, and studies in more challenging population for CCTA are needed, this study's initial experience with SR-DLR would improve the utility of CCTA in daily clinical practice due to the better image quality of the coronary arteries and in-stent lumen at CCTA compared with conventional MBIR.",Orii M; Sone M; Osaki T; Ueyama Y; Chiba T; Sasaki T; Yoshioka K,Contrast-to-noise ratio; Coronary computed tomography angiography; Model-based iterative reconstruction; Signal-to-noise ratio; Super-resolution deep learning reconstruction,2023,BMC medical imaging,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

METHODS: The bioreactor rotation speeds were adjusted in the range of 0 to 20 rpm, which could provide low shear on the microcarriers around 1 dyn/cm2. The cells were isolated via sequential digestions of neonatal (less than 3 days old) SD rat calvaria. After the primary culture and several passages, the cells were seeded onto the microcarriers and cultivated in T-flask, spinner flask and RWVB respectively. During the culture period, the cells were counted and observed under the inverted microscope for morphology every 12 h. After 7 days, the cells were evaluated with scanning electron microscope (SEM) for histological examination of the aggregates. Also, the hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining were performed. Moreover, von-Kossa staining and Alizarin Red S staining were carried out for mineralized nodule formation. RESULTS: The results showed that in RWVB, the cells could be expanded by more than ten times and they presented better morphology and vitality and stronger ability to form bones. CONCLUSIONS: The developed RWVB can provide the culture environment with a relatively low shear force and necessary three-dimensional (3D) interactions among cells and is suitable for osteopath expansion in vitro.",Song KD; Liu TQ; Li XQ; Cui ZF; Sun XY; Ma XH,,2007,Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,"Comparative Study; Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,17803843,Subtracted vortex centers path line method with cinematic angiography for measurement of flow speed in cerebral aneurysms.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The assessment of blood flow speed by imaging modalities is of increasing importance for endovascular treatment, such as stent implantation, of cerebral aneurysms. The subtracted vortex centers path line method (SVC method) utilizes image post-processing for determining flow quantitatively. In current practice, intra-aneurysmal flow in an in vitro model is visualized by laser sheet translumination and digitally recorded. In this study, we applied this method to cinematic angiography (CA), which is the preferred imaging method for endovascular interventions, to analyse hemodynamic changes. The SVC method was applied to the images and compared with results of the slipstream line method with colored fluid. METHODS: A transparent tubular model was constructed of silicone which included an aneurysm 10 mm in diameter and having a 5 mm neck on a straight parent artery with a diameter of 3.5 mm. The model was integrated into a pulsatile circulation system. By CA, successive images at 25 frames/s with injection of contrast were obtained. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Rotating vortexes of contrast, which advanced along the wall of the aneurysm, were observed in successive images of the aneurysm cavity. This phenomenon was also observed in the successive images with the slipstream line method. The speed of the vortex center was calculated and the results show that the vortex speed of CA was the same as that under the slipstream line method. This indicates the possibility of applying the SVC method to medical imaging equipment for analysis of the flow in aneurysms containing stent.",Ohta M; Fujimura N; Augsburger L; Barath K; Yilmaz H; Abdo G; Lovblad KO; Rüfenacht DA,,2008,Neurological research,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,21679853,Two-dimensional intravascular near-infrared fluorescence molecular imaging of inflammation in atherosclerosis and stent-induced vascular injury.,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to develop a 2-dimensional (2D) intravascular near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging strategy for investigation of arterial inflammation in coronary-sized vessels. BACKGROUND: Molecular imaging of arterial inflammation could provide new insights into the pathogenesis of acute myocardial infarction stemming from coronary atheromata and implanted stents. Presently, few high-resolution approaches can image inflammation in coronary-sized arteries in vivo. METHODS: A new 2.9-F rotational, automated pullback 2D imaging catheter was engineered and optimized for 360° viewing intravascular NIRF imaging. In conjunction with the cysteine protease-activatable imaging reporter Prosense VM110 (VisEn Medical, Woburn, Massachusetts), intra-arterial 2D NIRF imaging was performed in rabbit aortas with atherosclerosis (n =10) or implanted coronary bare-metal stents (n = 10, 3.5-mm diameter, day 7 post-implantation). Intravascular ultrasound provided coregistered anatomical images of arteries. After sacrifice, specimens underwent ex vivo NIRF imaging, fluorescence microscopy, and histological and immunohistochemical analyses. RESULTS: Imaging of coronary artery-scaled phantoms demonstrated 8-sector angular resolution and submillimeter axial resolution, nanomolar sensitivity to NIR fluorochromes, and modest NIRF light attenuation through blood. High-resolution NIRF images of vessel wall inflammation with signal-to-noise ratios >10 were obtained in real-time through blood, without flushing or occlusion. In atherosclerosis, 2D NIRF, intravascular ultrasound-NIRF fusion, microscopy, and immunoblotting studies provided insight into the spatial distribution of plaque protease activity. In stent-implanted vessels, real-time imaging illuminated an edge-based pattern of stent-induced arterial inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: A new 2D intravascular NIRF imaging strategy provides high-resolution in vivo spatial mapping of arterial inflammation in coronary-sized arteries and reveals increased inflammation-regulated cysteine protease activity in atheromata and stent-induced arterial injury.

rotating_wall,37588669,Three-dimensional reconstruction imaging by C-arm computed tomography accurately visualizes in-stent neointimal formation in patients with stent-assisted coil embolization.,"BACKGROUND: Stent apposition to the vessel wall and in-stent neointimal formation after stent-assisted coil embolization for intracranial aneurysm are important factors associated with postoperative thromboembolic complications. No assessment methods have been established to depict 3-dimensional (3D) all-round in-stent neointimal formation. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the superiority of Dyna-3D imaging assessment as a modality for all-round ISNF in comparison with conventional two-dimensional digital subtraction angiography (2D-DSA). METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent braided stent-assisted coil embolization for unruptured aneurysm between November 2016 and September 2021 were enrolled. Radiological assessments for stent apposition to the parent vessel after stent deployment and in-stent neointimal formation after 3 months were obtained. Dyna-3D was reconstructed by overlapping a plain image showing stent struts with a rotational DSA image showing the vessel lumen. Reconstructed Dyna-3D images can be rotated to any angle on the screen to evaluate to stent apposition around the vessel and in-stent neointimal formation in 3D, for comparison with 2D-DSA evaluations. RESULTS: Among the 73 patients enrolled, 70 patients (96%) showed complete stent wall apposition on Dyna-3D. Higher intra-rater agreement was confirmed on assessment of in-stent neointimal formation with Dyna-3D (Cohen's κ = 0.811) than with conventional 2D-DSA (Cohen's κ = 0.517). in-stent neointimal formation could not be confirmed on conventional imaging in 9 cases (16%) and on Dyna-3D in 2 cases (3%). The number of in-stent neointimal formations rated as stent wire completely outside the endothelial line was significantly higher with Dyna-3D than with 2D-DSA (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: All-round 3D evaluation by Dyna-3D imaging appears useful for confirming in-stent neointimal formation after braided stent deployment in patients after stent-assisted coil embolization.

rotating_wall,38748771,Volumetric microscopy of cerebral arteries with a miniaturized optical coherence tomography imaging probe.,"Endovascular interventions are increasingly becoming the preferred approach for treating strokes and cerebral artery diseases. These procedures rely on sophisticated angiographical imaging guidance, which encounters challenges because of limited contrast and spatial resolution. Achieving a more precise visualization of the underlying arterial pathology and neurovascular implants is crucial for accurate procedural decision-making. In a human study involving 32 patients, we introduced the clinical application of a miniaturized endovascular neuro optical coherence tomography (nOCT) imaging probe. This technology was designed to navigate the tortuous paths of the cerebrovascular circulation and to offer high-resolution imaging in situ. The nOCT probe is compatible with standard neurovascular microcatheters, integrating with the procedural workflow used in clinical routine. Equipped with a miniaturized optical fiber and a distal lens, the probe illuminates the tissue and collects the backscattered, near-infrared light. While rotating the fiber and the lens at high speed, the probe is rapidly retracted, creating a spiral-shaped light pattern to comprehensively capture the arterial wall and implanted devices. Using nOCT, we demonstrated volumetric microscopy of cerebral arteries in patients undergoing endovascular procedures. We imaged the anterior and posterior circulation of the brain, including distal segments of the internal carotid and middle-cerebral arteries, as well as the vertebral, basilar, and posterior cerebral arteries. We captured a broad spectrum of neurovascular pathologies, such as brain aneurysms, ischemic stroke, arterial stenoses, dissections, and intracranial atherosclerotic disease. nOCT offered artifact-free, high-resolution visualizations of intracranial artery pathology and neurovascular devices.",Pereira VM; Lylyk P; Cancelliere N; Lylyk PN; Lylyk I; Anagnostakou V; Bleise C; Nishi H; Epshtein M; King RM; Shazeeb MS; Puri AS; Liang CW; Hanel RA; Spears J; Marotta TR; Lopes DK; Gounis MJ; Ughi GJ,,2024,Science translational medicine,Journal Article,,

rotating_wall,32505663,Impact of lower limb movement on the hemodynamics of femoropopliteal arteries: A computational study.,"Femoropopliteal arteries (FPAs) are subjected to a wide range of deformations, mainly determined by leg movement. FPAs are often affected by atherosclerotic plaque development, presumably influenced by the biomechanics of surrounding tissues. Although abnormal hemodynamics in FPAs appears to be an important factor in driving plaque development, to date it has been investigated in few studies, in which the leg was modeled in either fixed straight or bent configuration. Hence, the current work investigates the impact of leg movement on FPA hemodynamics. An idealized model of FPA was created to perform moving-boundary computational fluid dynamics analyses. By mimicking hip rotation, knee flexion and complete movement of walking, the hemodynamics was compared between moving- and fixed-boundary models. Moreover, additional features affecting the hemodynamics (e.g. flow-rate curve amplitude, walking speed) were examined. Significant hemodynamic differences were found between the moving- and fixed-boundary models, with the leg movement inducing higher time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) (up to 66%). The flow-rate amplitude and walking period were the most influential parameters (differences in TAWSS up to 68% and 74%, respectively). In conclusion, this numerical approach highlighted the importance of considering leg movement to investigate FPA hemodynamics, and it could be employed in future patient-specific analyses.",Colombo M; Luraghi G; Cestariolo L; Ravasi M; Airoldi A; Chiastra C; Pennati G,Computational fluid dynamics; Femoropoplital artery; Moving boundary; Moving leg; Wall shear stress,2020,Medical engineering & physics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,28298037,Impact of bifurcation angle and inflow coefficient on the rupture risk of bifurcation type basilar artery tip aneurysms.,"OBJECTIVE Risk factors for aneurysm rupture have been extensively studied, with several factors showing significant correlations with rupture status. Several studies have shown that aneurysm shape and hemodynamics change after rupture. In the present study the authors investigated a static factor, the bifurcation angle, which does not change after rupture, to understand its effect on aneurysm rupture risk and hemodynamics. METHODS A hospital database was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients with cerebral aneurysms treated surgically or endovascularly in the period between 2008 and 2015. After acquiring 3D rotational angiographic data, 3D stereolithography models were created and computational fluid dynamic analysis was performed using commercially available software. Patient data (age and sex), morphometric factors (aneurysm volume and maximum height, aspect ratio, bifurcation angle, bottleneck ratio, and neck/parent artery ratio), and hemodynamic factors (inflow coefficient and wall shear stress) were statistically compared between ruptured and unruptured groups. RESULTS Seventy-one basilar tip aneurysms were included in this study, 22 ruptured and 49 unruptured. Univariate analysis showed aspect ratio, bifurcation angle, bottleneck ratio, and inflow coefficient were significantly correlated with a ruptured status. Logistic regression analysis showed that aspect ratio and bifurcation angle were significant predictors of a ruptured status. Bifurcation angle was inversely correlated with inflow coefficient (p < 0.0005), which in turn correlated directly with mean (p = 0.028) and maximum (p = 0.014) wall shear stress (WSS) using Pearson's correlation coefficient, whereas aspect ratio was inversely correlated with mean (0.012) and minimum (p = 0.018) WSS. CONCLUSIONS Bifurcation angle and aspect ratio are independent predictors for aneurysm rupture. Bifurcation angle, which does not change after rupture, is correlated with hemodynamic factors including inflow coefficient and WSS, as well as rupture status.

We present a case in which we found the hyoid bone protruding into the carotid vessels and may have been contributing, in part, to atherosclerotic carotid stenosis. CASE PRESENTATION: An 85-year-old woman presenting with left arm and leg weakness consistent with right hemispheric transient ischemic attack. Magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA) and carotid non-invasive studies revealed a 90% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. At surgery, the hyoid bone on the right side was projecting into the internal carotid artery, causing indentation. There was associated rotation of the internal and external carotid arteries from their normal position. Right carotid endarterectomy was performed and the lateral one-third of the hyoid bone excised to alleviate the external compression. Postoperative spiral computerized tomography (CT) scan of the carotid vessels demonstrated the extent of hyoid resection as well as rotation of the external and internal carotid arteries. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest the possible contribution of hyoid bone compression to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis. This report also highlights the diagnostic value of CT angiography in the assessment of carotid artery occlusive disease.",Abdelaziz OS; Ogilvy CS; Lev M,,1999,Surgical neurology,Case Reports; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,31056433,The SCIP propeller flap: Versatility for reconstruction of locoregional defect(✰).,"INTRODUCTION: Abdominopelvic defect is frequently a challenge. Several local flaps exist for this anatomical region, but sequelae of the donor site, particularly with regard to morbidity on the anterior abdominal wall, are frequent. Although the utility of the superficial circumflex iliac artery flap is well established in its free form as well as its pedicled form described by McGregor, the superficial circumflex iliac artery perforator (SCIP) propeller flap is rarely reported. The purpose of this study is to highlight the possible range of locoregional coverage using the SCIP propeller flap. METHODS: Between 2012 and 2018, 72 SCIP flaps were made in the propeller version to cover locoregional defects of various etiologies in our units. RESULTS: The dimensions of SCIP flaps were on average 20.2 cm long (9-39) by 8.2 cm wide (5-18). The average rotation angle was 163.3° (range 130-180). In sixteen patients, SCIP flaps were bilateral. In five cases, the reconstruction was combined with a contralateral Tensor Fascia Lata (TFL) flap to cover a very large defect. Two SCIP flaps necrotized following global venous congestion and a TFL flap was performed in rescue. No complications appeared on the donor site and the patients did not have any functional complications related to the reconstruction. Particular care was taken to respect the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh. CONCLUSION: The SCIP propeller flap provides a reliable and versatile method for reconstructing abdominoperineal defect, including the thigh root region to the trochanters with low donor site morbidity.",Boissière F; Luca-Pozner V; Vaysse C; Kerfant N; Herlin C; Chaput B,Perforator flap; Perineal defect; Propeller flap; SCIP flap,2019,"Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",Case Reports; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,25441668,Staple aneurysmorrhaphy to salvage autogenous arteriovenous fistulas with aneurysm-related complications.,"OBJECTIVE: Aneurysm-related complications could lead to loss of a functioning arteriovenous fistula (AVF). We report our midterm and long-term results with the staple aneurysmorrhaphy technique to repair and preserve aneurysmal AVFs. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our surgical treatment of patients with aneurysmal autogenous AVF complicated by skin erosion, bleeding, infection, pain, and difficulty with needle access from 2007 through 2014. We identified 52 patients, 40 (77%) of whom underwent repair with the staple aneurysmorrhaphy technique. The operation involved mobilizing the entire aneurysmal segments. A TA (Covidien, Norwalk, Conn) or Endo GIA (Covidien, Mansfield, Mass) stapler was used to resect the redundant aneurysm wall to create a 6- to 8-mm-diameter conduit. A subcutaneous skin flap was created after excising compromised skin. The remodeled vein was repositioned underneath the subcutaneous flap, with the staple line rotated laterally to avoid needle puncture. RESULTS: We attempted staple aneurysmorrhaphy in 40 patients with complicated AVF aneurysms, of which 38 repairs (95%) were successful. Median patient age was 66 years (range, 29-88 years). Median AVF age was 63 months (range, 12-136 months). Median follow-up was 20 months (range, 5-81 months). At 1 year, primary patency was 67%, assisted primary patency was 88%, and secondary patency was 91%. At 2 years, primary patency was 59%, assisted primary patency was 84%, and secondary patency was 91%. At 3 years, primary patency was 46%, assisted primary patency was 69%, and secondary patency was 85%. Surgery was performed under local-regional anesthesia in 28 patients (70%) and under general anesthesia in the remaining 12 (30%). Proximal venous outflow stenoses were detected in 19 of 40 AVFs (48%) preoperatively and in 11 of 38 AVFs (29%) postoperatively. Aneurysm recurrence occurred in two repaired AVFs. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with staple aneurysmorrhaphy shows that it is an effective, safe, and durable procedure to preserve a functioning autogenous AVF with complicated aneurysmal degeneration. Key principles are to reduce the vein to normal adjacent diameter and to provide healthy skin coverage. The remodeled AVF has a low aneurysm recurrence rate and maintains the beneficial properties of superior patency and low infection. It is important to aggressively monitor for and treat proximal outflow venous stenoses to prevent aneurysm recurrence. The surgery can be done safely under local anesthesia in selected patients. rights reserved.",Vo T; Tumbaga G; Aka P; Behseresht J; Hsu J; Tayarrah M,,2015,Journal of vascular surgery,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,27567021,First prospective multicenter experience with the 7 French Glidesheath slender for complex transradial coronary interventions.,"PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility and safety of the 7 French (Fr) Glidesheath Slender for complex transradial (TR) percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). BACKGROUND: The TR approach is increasingly used worldwide for coronary and peripheral vascular interventions. However, the small size of the radial artery remains an important limitation for the use of large-bore guiding catheters (>6 Fr), restricting thereby the treatment of highly complex lesions through the TR approach. The 7 Fr Glidesheath slender (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) is a new dedicated radial sheath with a thinner wall and hydrophilic coating. It combines an inner diameter compatible with any 7 Fr guiding catheter and an outer diameter smaller than current 7 Fr sheaths. METHODS: Prospective multicenter registry of complex TR PCI cases using the 7 Fr Glidesheath Slender to determine the procedural success, rates of vascular complications, radial spasm, and radial artery occlusion (RAO). RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were included. Procedural success was 97% with only one access-site crossover. The use of a 7 Fr guiding catheter was indicated for the treatment of highly complex coronary lesions including distal left main (LM) disease (n = 20), complex non-LM bifurcation lesions (n = 16), chronic total occlusion (n = 15), and severely calcified vessels requiring rotational atherectomy (n = 10). There were three vascular access-site complications (4.7%) including two moderate (type II) local hematoma and one uncomplicated guiding catheter-induced brachial artery dissection. None of the patients experienced major bleeding. The occurrence of radial spasm was reported in seven patients (11%). Doppler ultrasound imaging of the radial artery at 1 month was available in 62 of 64 radial access with three cases of RAO (4.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of the 7 Fr Glidesheath slender for complex coronary interventions is feasible and associated with a high rate of procedural success and a low rate of vascular complications. These favorable results need be confirmed in larger multicenter studies. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Aminian A; Iglesias JF; Van Mieghem C; Zuffi A; Ferrara A; Manih R; Dolatabadi D; Lalmand J; Saito S,complex PCI; radial occlusion; radial sheath; slender; transradial access; transradial approach,2017,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the,Journal Article; Multicenter Study,,

On internal examination, a giant intracranial aneurysm (3.4 x 2.6 x 2.7 cm) was observed on the trunk of the right vertebral artery. The aneurysm compressed the right side of the lower one-third of the pons and adjacent medulla oblongata. On sectioning, almost all of the aneurysm lumen was filled with a firm, clearly laminated organized thrombus. There was no evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Histopathological analyses revealed congestion and hypoxic tissue changes in all organs examined. In microscopic sections of the giant vertebral aneurysm, thick fibrotic walls, intimal hyperplasia and organized thrombi in the lumen were found. Lots of intrathrombotic clefts with fresh erythrocytes were also observed.

Materials and Methods: Idealized aortoiliac geometries were constructed either through direct 3-dimensional (3D) printing (rigid) or through casting with polyvinyl alcohol using 3D-printed molds (flexible). Flexible model bending rigidity was controlled by altering wall thickness. Three flexible patient-specific models were also created based on the preoperative computed tomography angiograms. Zenith infrarenal and fenestrated devices were used in this study. The models were pressurized to 100 mm Hg with normal saline. Deployments were performed under fluoroscopy at 37°C. Rotation was calculated by tracking the change in position of gold markers affixed to the devices. Results: In the rigid idealized models, stent-graft rotation increased with increasing torsion; torsion levels of 1.6, 2.6, and 3.6 mm(-1) had mean rotations of 5.2°±0.03°, 11.2°±4.8°, and 27.6°±13.0°, respectively (p<0.001). In the flexible models, the highest rotation (58°±3.0°) was observed in models with high torsion and high rigidity (7.5 mm(-1) net torsion and 254 N·m(2) flexural rigidity). No rotation was observed in the absence of torsion. Applying torque to the device during insertion significantly increased stent-graft rotation by an average of 28° across all levels of torsion (p<0.01). Multiple device insertions prior to deployment did not change the observed device rotation. The patient-specific models accurately predicted the degree of rotation seen intraoperatively to within 5°. Conclusion: Insertion technique plays an important role in the degree of stent-graft rotation during deployment. Our model suggests that in vivo correction of device orientation can increase the observed rotation and supports the concept of fully removing the device, adjusting the orientation, and subsequently reinserting. Additionally, increasing iliac artery torsion in the presence of increased vessel rigidity results in stent-graft rotation.",Crawford SA; Doyle MG; Amon CH; Forbes TL,aortoiliac models; deployment technique; device orientation; endovascular aneurysm repair; fenestrated stent-graft; in vitro experiment; patient-specific modeling; rigidity; rotation; stent-graft; torque; torsion,2019,Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Morphological, geometric, and hemodynamic parameters have been identified as factors contributing to the rupture of intracranial aneurysms. However, there are no studies that combine these 3 types of parameters to specifically target MbifA rupture. METHODS: This study enrolled all patients with MbifAs diagnosed at our treatment center from 1 April 2021 to 31 July 2023 who met the study criteria. All patients underwent digital subtraction angiography examination to obtain 3D rotational angiography data. We imported the complete image data into the Aneurysm/Artery Reconstruction and Analysis machine to obtain 13 morphological parameters (D(neck), D(dome), Height, D(max), D(artery), aspect ratio [AR], size ratio, dome-neck-ratio [DNR], height-artery-ratio, bottleneck factor, Inflow Angle, Incline Angle, Arterial Angle), 5 geometric parameters (V,S,undulation index [UI], ellipticity index [EI],nonsphericity index [NSI]), and 5 hemodynamic parameters (wall shear stress [WSS], the maximum WSS, the parent artery WSS, the normalized WSS [NWSS], oscillatory shear index [OSI]). All the above significant parameters were tested by univariate and multivariate analyses to find out the independent discriminatory factors. RESULTS: A total of 49 MbifAs (16 ruptured and 33 unruptured) from 44 patients were included in the study. Height (P = 0.033), AR (P = 0.007), DNR (P = 0.011), EI (P = 0.042), NSI(P = 0.030), UI(P = 0.027), WSS(P = 0.033), and NWSS(P = 0.002) were all associated with MbifA rupture in univariate analyses, but only NWSS was an independent risk factor (P = 0.036, OR = 0.046, 95% CI: 0.003-0.815) in multivariate logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Height, AR, DNR, EI, UI, NSI, WSS, and NWSS may be correlated with MbifA rupture, but only NWSS was an independent risk factor. A lower NWSS was associated with a higher risk of MbifA rupture. No significant differences were observed in the angle parameters, including the Inflow Angle, between ruptured and unruptured MbifAs. OSI was significantly increased at the dome of the aneurysm but the mean OSI was not found to be associated with MbifA rupture.",Qiu Y; Jiang L; Peng S; Zhu J; Zhang X; Xu R,Geometry; Hemodynamics; Imaging analysis; MbifA; Morphology; Rupture,2024,World neurosurgery,Journal Article,,

The second patient is of particular interest, since the correct diagnosis was missed because of the presence of a multitude of associated anomalies. These included a tracheobronchial anomaly, a ventricular septal defect with a dilated pulmonary trunk, and a left-ward shift of the heart secondary to pulmonary emphysema on the right. Therefore, the indentation in the esophagus was absent, while the shift and rotation of the heart led to a misinterpretation of the exact course of the left pulmonary artery on the angiocardiogram. These cases are presented to reemphasize that ""vascular sling"", although rare, is indeed a serious cause of respiratory distress in infancy. Early recognition is of vital importance, since surgical repair of the vascular anomaly seems to be the only benificial procedure in these patients.",Lubbers WJ; Tegelaers WH; Losekoot TG; Becker AE,,1975,European journal of cardiology,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,21569032,Automated analysis of three-dimensional xylem networks using high-resolution computed tomography.,"Connections between xylem vessels represent important links in the vascular network, but the complexity of three-dimensional (3D) organization has been difficult to access. This study describes the development of a custom software package called TANAX (Tomography-derived Automated Network Analysis of Xylem) that automatically extracts vessel dimensions and the distribution of intervessel connections from high-resolution computed tomography scans of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) stems, although the method could be applied to other species. Manual and automated analyses of vessel networks yielded similar results, with the automated method generating orders of magnitude more data in a fraction of the time. In 4.5-mm-long internode sections, all vessels and all intervessel connections among 115 vessels were located, and the connections were analyzed for their radial distribution, orientation, and predicted shared wall area. Intervessel connections were more frequent in lateral than in dorsal/ventral zones. The TANAX-reconstructed network, in combination with commercial software, was used to visualize vessel networks in 3D. The 3D volume renderings of vessel networks were freely rotated for observation from any angle, and the 4.5 μm virtual serial sections were capable of being viewed in any plane, revealing aspects of vessel organization not possible with traditional serial sections.",Brodersen CR; Lee EF; Choat B; Jansen S; Phillips RJ; Shackel KA; McElrone AJ; Matthews MA,,2011,The New phytologist,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,20198653,New milliliter-scale stirred tank bioreactors for the cultivation of mycelium forming microorganisms.,"A novel milliliter-scale stirred tank bioreactor was developed for the cultivation of mycelium forming microorganisms on a 10 milliliter-scale. A newly designed one-sided paddle impeller is driven magnetically and rotates freely on an axis in an unbaffled reaction vessel made of polystyrene. A rotating lamella is formed which spreads out along the reactor wall. Thus an enhanced surface-to-volume ratio of the liquid phase is generated where oxygen is introduced via surface aeration. Volumetric oxygen transfer coefficients (k(L)a) > 0.15 s(-1) were measured. The fast moving liquid lamella efficiently prevents wall growth and foaming. Mean power consumption and maximum local energy dissipation were measured as function of operating conditions in the milliliter-scale stirred tank bioreactor (V = 10 mL) and compared to a standard laboratory-scale stirred tank bioreactor with six-bladed Rushton turbines (V = 2,000 mL). Mean power consumption increases with increasing impeller speed and shows the same characteristics and values on both scales. The maximum local energy dissipation of the milliliter-scale stirred tank bioreactor was reduced compared to the laboratory-scale at the same mean volumetric power input. Hence the milliliter impeller distributes power more uniformly in the reaction medium. Based on these data a reliable and robust scale-up of fermentation processes is possible. This was demonstrated with the cultivation of the actinomycete Streptomyces tendae on both scales. It was shown that the process performances were equivalent with regard to biomass concentration, mannitol consumption and production of the pharmaceutical relevant fungicide nikkomycin Z up to a process time of 120 h. A high parallel reproducibility was observed on the milliliter-scale (standard deviation < 8%) with up to 48 stirred tank bioreactors operated in a magnetic inductive drive. Rheological behavior of the culture broth was measured and showed a highly viscous shear-thinning non-Newtonian behavior. The newly developed one-sided paddle impellers operated in unbaffled reactors on a 10 milliliter-scale with a magnetic inductive drive for up to 48 parallel bioreactors allows for the first time the parallel bioprocess development with mycelium forming microorganisms. This is especially important since these kinds of cultivations normally exhibit process times of 100 h and more. Thus the operation of parallel stirred tank reactors will have the potential to reduce process development times drastically.",Hortsch R; Stratmann A; Weuster-Botz D,,2010,Biotechnology and bioengineering,Journal Article,,

A 79-year-old man who presented with disturbance of consciousness and vomiting was transferred to our hospital. The initial head CT revealed an intraventricular hemorrhage in the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles, predominantly involving the right lateral ventricle associated with obstructive hydrocephalus. CT angiography and three-dimensional rotational angiography(3D-RA)revealed SSS-DAVF with retrograde venous drainage from the cortical venous system to the subependymal venous system through engorged superficial/anastomotic/deep medullary or transcerebral veins, showing a pseudophlebitic pattern. A severe stenosis of the SSS was observed at the site just proximal to the shunting point. A varix of the right transvers caudate vein(TCV)was observed within the thickest portion of the hematoma in close contact with the wall of the right lateral ventricle. A stenosis of the branching point of the right TCV was detected on the 3D-RA image. The DAVF was completely cured after transarterial embolization. The varix gradually shrank and finally disappeared after 2 months. This is the first report of a case of PIVH due to SSS-DAVF with a subependymal varix considered as the bleeding point. Serial gadolinium-enhanced MR images clearly showed the shrinking of the varix. Our case is the second reported case of spontaneous resolution of the varix after embolization of the DAVF. The obstructive changes of the two venous outflow pathways(SSS/TCV)might further worsen the state of venous congestion in the deep medullary venous system and eventually lead to formation and rupture of the varix.",Ozono K; Chikamatsu G; Nakamura H; Shiozaki E; Hiu T; Horie N; Kawahara I; Ono T; Haraguchi W; Ushijima R; Tsutsumi K,,2019,No shinkei geka.

rotating_wall,18238459,Speckle-motion artifact under tissue shearing.,"Research has shown that, for a rotating phantom, the speckle pattern may not replicate the phantom motion, rather it may show a large lateral translation component in addition to rotation. This translation effect was labeled speckle-motion artifact. An image formation model has been shown to explain the phenomenon, pointing to the curvature of the imaging system point spread function (PSF) at the origin of this effect. The present paper extends this analysis and proposes a model, which predicts that a lateral motion artifact also would occur with shear motion. In the model, the artifact is found to be proportional to the shear angle and dependent of shear orientation, being maximal for shear that runs parallel to the axial direction; as for rotation, the artifact increases with frequency and beamwidth. This would mean that, when viewing a parabolic flow in the far field or with a highly curved PSF, an apparent contraction/expansion pattern in the direction of the vessel wall would be superimposed to the real velocity profile. In elastography, when viewing an inclusion subjected to an axial strain, four motion artifact regions are expected near the inclusion. The model is developed using the Fourier domain representation of the speckles for tissue-motion compensated signals, also called Lagrangian speckle. It can explain the artifact in terms of a simple spectral translation of a parabolic phase profile; given this, it is shown the artifact would be proportional to the lateral derivative of the axial displacement field. The spectral representation of Lagrangian speckle, for shear, also provides a simple geometrical interpretation for speckle decorrelation in terms of the shear strength and orientation, and in terms of the beam characteristics, i.e., the axial and lateral bandwidth.",Maurice RL; Bertrand M,,1999,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,37188332,A comparison study of vessel twisting by different microsurgical suture techniques in a chicken wing artery side to side bypass training model.,"OBJECTIVE: Microvascular anastomosis, particularly side-to-side (STS) bypass, is a complex surgical procedure. While several suture techniques exist, none of them is superior to the others. We assessed the association between various STS bypass techniques and vessel twisting using chicken wing training models. METHODS: Three suture techniques were compared over an anterior wall suture procedure. The unidirectional continuous suture (UCS) group used a downward ""right-to-left"" continuous suture. The reverse continuous suture (RCS) group used a downward ""left-to-right"" continuous suture. The interrupted suture (IS) group used the standard interrupted suture. The number of samples in each of the three groups was 30 (n=90). We compared the incidence of vessel twisting and rotation angles across groups. RESULTS: Vessel twisting occurred in 96.7%, 56.7%, and 0% of the cases in the UCS, IS, and RCS groups, respectively. The incidence of vessel twisting differed significantly in all 3 groups (p<0.001), with an apparent trend (p=0.002). The mean rotation angles were 201˚±90.6˚, 102˚±107.6˚, and 0˚ in the UCS, IS, and RCS groups, respectively, which were significantly different (p<0.001). On excluding cases without twisting, the rotation angles of twisted vessels in the UCS and IS groups were 207.9˚±83.7˚ and 180˚±77.9˚, respectively, which yielded a significant difference between these groups (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We found that the incidence and trend of vessel twisting differed significantly across suture techniques.

rotating_wall,8825220,The role of bone traumatization in the initiation of proximal deep vein thrombosis during cemented hip replacement surgery in pigs.,"Hip arthroplasty is associated with a high frequency of postoperative solitary proximal deep vein thrombosis which seems most frequently observed when bone cement is used for prosthesis fixation. Eighteen pigs underwent hemiarthroplasty, eight with cement-fixed prostheses and eight with non-cement prosthesis installation. Levels of thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) activity were determined in femoral vein blood from both limbs during and after surgery. On the operated side, TAT increased during bone traumatization followed by a substantial rise in t-PA activity and a gradual decline in PAI-1 activity. This indicates a local per- and post-operative sequential activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis followed by a fibrinolytic shutdown, all reflected in femoral vein blood on the operated side. In the animals receiving noncemented hip prostheses, the same pattern of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis occurred on the operated side. This was, however, less marked than with the cement-fixed prostheses. Postoperative scanning electron microscopic (SEM) examination of the femoral veins showed thrombi on the operated side in 62% of the animals in the cement group and 25% in the non-cement group. In an additional study with eight animals undergoing cement-anchored hip prosthesis operations the levels of TAT, t-PA and PAI-I were analysed in femoral vein blood, mixed venous blood and arterial blood. Significantly higher levels were found in femoral vein blood compared with mixed venous blood while no significant change was found in arterial blood compared with mixed venous blood. The hyperthermia induced by curing bone cement was effectively conducted by the implanted prosthesis and did not seem to exert major influence on the activation of coagulation. Extreme rotation of the limbs during surgery did not in itself induce visible vein wall damage as judged by SEM. These studies indicate that traumatization of bone marrow during hip surgery induce a marked local activation of coagulation and a high incidence of deep vein thrombosis in proximal veins, in particular if bone cement is used for prosthesis fixation.",Dahl OE; Aspelin T; Lyberg T,,1995,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and,Journal Article,,

Following standard protocols cells were stimulated lineage specific towards the osteogenic and chondrogenic lines. To evaluate the effects of applied cytomechanical forces towards cellular differentiation distinct parameters were measured (morphology, antigen and antigen expression) after a total cultivation period of 21 days in vitro.

rotating_wall,35622437,Mapping Atrial Fibrillation After Surgical Therapy to Guide Endocardial Ablation.,"BACKGROUND: Surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) can be effective, yet has mixed results. It is unclear which endocardial lesions delivered as part of hybrid therapy' will best augment surgical lesion sets in individual patients. We addressed this question by systematically mapping AF endocardially after surgical ablation and relating findings to early recurrence, then performing tailored endocardial ablation as part of hybrid therapy. METHODS: We studied 81 consecutive patients undergoing epicardial surgical ablation (stage 1 hybrid), of whom 64 proceeded to endocardial catheter mapping and ablation (stage 2). Stage 2 comprised high-density mapping of pulmonary vein (PV) or posterior wall (PW) reconnections, low-voltage zones (LVZs), and potential localized AF drivers. We related findings to postsurgical recurrence of AF. RESULTS: Mapping at stage 2 revealed PW isolation reconnection in 59.4%, PV isolation reconnection in 28.1%, and LVZ in 42.2% of patients. Postsurgical recurrence of AF occurred in 36 patients (56.3%), particularly those with long-standing persistent AF (P=0.017), but had no relationship to reconnection of PVs (P=0.53) or PW isolation (P=0.75) when compared with those without postsurgical recurrence of AF. LVZs were more common in patients with postsurgical recurrence of AF (P=0.002), long-standing persistent AF (P=0.002), advanced age (P=0.03), and elevated CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc (P=0.046). AF mapping revealed 4.4±2.7 localized focal/rotational sites near and also remote from PV or PW reconnection. After ablation at patient-specific targets, arrhythmia freedom at 1 year was 81.0% including and 73.0% excluding previously ineffective antiarrhythmic medications. CONCLUSIONS: After surgical ablation, AF may recur by several modes particularly related to localized mechanisms near low voltage zones, recovery of posterior wall or pulmonary vein isolation, or other sustaining mechanisms. LVZs are more common in patients at high clinical risk for recurrence. Patient-specific targeting of these mechanisms yields excellent long-term outcomes from hybrid ablation.",Bhatia NK; Shah RL; Deb B; Pong T; Kapoor R; Rogers AJ; Badhwar N; Brodt C; Wang PJ; Narayan SM; Lee AM,atrial fibrillation; catheters; humans; pulmonary veins; surgery,2022,Circulation.

METHODS: Thirteen fresh cadaveric thoraxes were dissected bilaterally. A precise and reproducible protocol was performed. For each abTAA flap cadaveric dissection, the following parameters were measured after arterial injection: distances between the origin of the perforator artery on the abTAA and the sternum, the acromion, the clavicle, diameter of the perforator artery of the abTAA, length of the perforator pedicle course through major pectoralis muscle, and rotation arc. We also calculated the surface of the injected skin paddle. These measurements were related to morphometric parameters evaluated through the distance between sternum and acromion. RESULTS: The mean distances measured from the origin of the perforator artery on the abTAA were 14.25 cm to the sternum, 3.45 cm to the acromion, 5.65 cm to the clavicle. The mean diameter of the abTAA was 1.20 mm ± 0.2. The arc of rotation was 180°, and the length of the perforator pedicle could be extended to 7.46 cm ± 1.15. We observed an colored elliptical cutaneous paddle with a longer radius 18 cm and a small radius 15 cm.

rotating_wall,11891860,Characterization of the osteoblast-like cell phenotype under microgravity conditions in the NASA-approved Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor (RWV).,"Weightlessness induces bone loss in humans and animal models. We employed the NASA-approved Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor (RWV) to develop osteoblast-like cell cultures under microgravity and evaluate osteoblast phenotype and cell function. Rat osteoblast-like cell line (ROS.SMER#14) was grown in the RWV at a calculated gravity of 0.008g. For comparison, aliquots of cells were grown in conventional tissue culture dishes or in Non-Rotating Wall Vessels (N-RWV) maintained at unit gravity. In RWV, osteoblasts showed high levels of alkaline phosphatase expression and activity, and elevated expression of osteopontin, osteocalcin, and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4). In contrast, the expression of osteonectin, bone sialoprotein II and BMP-2 were unaltered compared to cells in conventional culture conditions. These observations are consistent with a marked osteoblast phenotype. However, we observed that in RWV osteoblasts showed reduced proliferation. Furthermore, DNA nucleosome-size fragmentation was revealed both morphologically, by in situ staining with the Thymine-Adenine binding dye bis-benzimide, and electrophoretically, by DNA laddering. Surprisingly, no p53, nor bcl-2/bax, nor caspase 8 pathways were activated by microgravity, therefore the intracellular cascade leading to programmed cell death remains to be elucidated. Finally, consistent with an osteoclast-stimulating effect by microgravity, osteoblasts cultured in RWV showed upregulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA, and IL-6 proved to be active at stimulating osteoclast formation and resorbing activity in vitro. We conclude that under microgravity, reduced osteoblast life span and enhanced IL-6 expression may result in inefficient osteoblast- and increased osteoclast-activity, respectively, thus potentially contributing to bone loss in individuals subjected to weightlessness.",Rucci N; Migliaccio S; Zani BM; Taranta A; Teti A,,2002,Journal of cellular biochemistry,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

All patients had a cardiothoracic ratio of greater than 0.50 and clear lung fields radiographically. Using standard gamma camera tomographic reconstruction techniques, images of transaxial slices were obtained during a 360 degree rotation around the thorax of the subject breathing the radioactive gas 81mKr. The transaxial images, acquired over 10 min were aligned in each posture at the level of the cardiac apex, mid-heart, and aortic arch and were matched in relation to a radioactive marker on the chest wall and to anatomic landmarks. A horizontal line (gravity independent and parallel to the couch) was drawn on the transaxial section through the dorsal regions of the right and left lung. Counts per resolution element (12 to 15 mm) were plotted along this line and the ratios of the peak values in right and left lung compared. These ratios represent differences in regional ventilation per unit lung volume. In controls the mean left-to-right (L/R) peak count ratio varied from 0.91 to 1.00 at the three levels (range: 0.76 to 1.04); there were no significant differences between supine and prone. In patients with cardiomegaly the mean (+/- SEM) L/R peak count ratio at cardiac apex, mid-heart, and aortic arch was 0.46 (+/- 0.08), 0.55 (+/- 0.07), and 0.89 (+/- 0.08) when supine and 1.04 (+/- 0.07), 1.05 (+/- 0.05), and 1.08 (+/- 0.07) when prone, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Wiener CM; McKenna WJ; Myers MJ; Lavender JP; Hughes JM,,1990,The American review of respiratory disease,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,27013231,Development of an angiogenesis animal model featuring brain arteriovenous malformation histological characteristics.,"BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis has a key role in the formation and evolution of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Numerous models have been developed aiming to recreate configuration of brain AVMs. OBJECTIVE: To develop an animal model sharing the same pathological characteristics as human brain AVMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten pigs were divided into two groups. Five animals underwent endovascular left common carotid artery (CCA) and external carotid artery (ECA) occlusion and five animals served as controls. DSA, associated with 3D-rotational angiography, was performed at day 0 and at 3 months in both groups. The volume of the retia was calculated. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A serum levels were measured in both groups at the same time intervals. Finally, the animals were sacrificed at 3 months and the retia were harvested for pathological and immunohistochemistry examinations. RESULTS: At 3 months, a significantly higher rete volume was seen in group A than in group B (2.92±0.33 mL vs 1.87±0.69 mL, respectively; p=0.016). There was a trend for increased VEGF-A levels in group A at 3 months. In the occlusion group, histological findings showed significant reduction of media thickness and disrupted internal elastic lamina; immunohistochemistry findings showed strong reactivity for VEGF receptors and interleukin 6. CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral endovascular occlusion of the CCA-ECA results in angiogenesis triggering of the rete mirabile with both significant augmentation of the rete volume and histological evidence of pro-angiogenic stimulation. already granted under a licence) please go to http://www.bmj.com/company/products-services/rights-and-licensing/.",Papagiannaki C; Clarençon F; Ponsonnard S; Couquet C; Maizeroi-Eugène F; Bresson D; Yardin C; Mounayer C,Angiography; Arteriovenous Malformation; Vessel Wall,2017,Journal of neurointerventional surgery,Journal Article,,

We selected 3 patients with multiple unruptured aneurysms including at least one with atherosclerotic changes and investigated whether an image-based CFD study could provide useful information for discriminating the atherosclerotic aneurysms. Patient-specific geometries were constructed from three-dimensional data obtained using rotational angiography. Transient simulations were conducted under patient-specific inlet flow rates measured by phase-contrast magnetic resonance velocimetry. In the postanalyses, we calculated time-averaged wall shear stress (WSS), oscillatory shear index, and relative residence time (RRT). The volume of blood flow entering aneurysms through the neck and the mean velocity of blood flow inside aneurysms were examined. We applied the age-of-fluid method to quantitatively assess the residence of blood inside aneurysms. Atherosclerotic changes coincided with regions exposed to disturbed blood flow, as indicated by low WSS and long RRT. Blood entered aneurysms in phase with inlet flow rates. The mean velocities of blood inside atherosclerotic aneurysms were lower than those inside nonatherosclerotic aneurysms. Blood in atherosclerotic aneurysms was older than that in nonatherosclerotic aneurysms, especially near the wall.

rotating_wall,18452376,Treatment of lower extremity vascular disease: the Diamondback 360 degrees Orbital Atherectomy System.,"Atherosclerotic disease affecting the arteries of the lower extremities becomes symptomatic with the onset of pain either at rest or with ambulation. The disease, commonly referred to as peripheral arterial disease (PAD), affects nearly 30 million individuals in Europe and North America alone. The predominant factor responsible for the impaired functional capacity and quality of life in the presence of lower-extremity PAD is inadequate blood flow due to atherosclerotic plaque build-up within the arteries. Without successful lifestyle risk modifications or judicious pharmacotherapy, individuals with lower-extremity PAD may develop disabling complications that require endovascular treatment, bypass surgery or amputation of the affected extremity. The Diamondback 360 degrees Orbital Atherectomy System is a promising new methodology for treating symptomatic PAD within the major and branch arteries of the leg. The device differs from other atherectomy technologies by its unique orbiting action to remove plaque and the ability to increase lumen diameter by increasing the orbital speed. Applying the principles of centrifugal force, an eccentrically mounted diamond-coated crown rotates at high speed to sand away plaque as the crown is slowly advanced through the narrowed or occluded section of artery. As crown rotation increases, centrifugal force presses the crown against the stenotic lesion to effect plaque removal, while the less diseased, more elastic arterial wall flexes away from the crown, minimizing the risk of vessel trauma. The increasing crown orbit creates a larger lumen and minimizes procedure time and the need for catheter upsizing. This device profile presents an overview of the prevalence and symptoms of PAD, describes the Diamondback 360 Orbital Atherectomy System components and mechanism of action, and closes with a case study review and perspective regarding how lower-extremity PAD will be treated in the next 5 years.",Heuser RR,,2008,Expert review of medical devices,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",,
rotating_wall,27824561,Investigation of Crossbeam Multi-receiver Configurations for Accurate 3-D Vector Doppler Velocity Estimation.,"An accurate estimation of low blood velocities whose Doppler shifts span the wall filter cutoff, such as near the wall in recirculation or disturbed flow regions, is important for accurate mapping of velocities to achieve improved estimations of wall shear stress and turbulence, which are known risk factors for atherosclerosis and stroke. This paper presents the comparative benefit of increasing the number of receiver beams above three for an improved estimation of low 3-D velocities. The 3-D crossbeam vector Doppler ultrasound configurations were studied in terms of the number of receiver beams, interbeam angle, and beam selection method (criterion for discriminating between tissue and blood Doppler signals) for a range of velocity orientations, which may prove useful in the design of a future 2-D array for vascular imaging. For maximum velocity resolution, a shallow gradient of low flow velocities up to 5 cm/s was generated across a large-diameter (2.46 cm) straight vessel. Data were acquired using a linear array rotated around the central transmit beam axis to generate three- to eight-receiver (3R-8R) configurations;the rotation of each configuration relative to the flow axis was used to mimic a broad range of velocity vector orientations. Accuracy and precision for ≥5 receivers were consistently better over all velocity orientations and for all selection methods. For a velocity magnitude of 2 cm/s, the best accuracy and precision in both magnitude and direction (~21% ± 13%, <1° ± 9°, respectively) were seen with a 5R configuration using a weighted least-squares selection method. Asymmetry in the 5R configuration led to an improved accuracy and precision compared with that in symmetrical 6R and 8R configurations. The results demonstrated relatively little to no benefit from more than five receiver beams.",Hussain B; Yiu BY; Yu AC; Lacefield JC; Poepping TL,,2016,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",Journal Article,,

Part I: experimental study.,"Surface modified bioactive glass with surface properties akin to those of the bone mineral phase is an attractive candidate for use as a microcarrier material for 3-D growth of bone-like tissue in rotating wall vessel bioreactors (RWVs). The critical surface properties of this material are the result of reaction in solution. Because an RWV environment is completely different from conditions previously employed for bioactive glass testing, a detailed study of the surface reactions is warranted. Under properly chosen conditions, RWVs can also provide a simulated microgravity environment for the bioactive glass (BG) particles. In this sense, this study is also a report on the behavior of a bioactive material under microgravity conditions simulated on earth. A high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) and carefully selected experimental conditions enabled the simulation of microgravity in our laboratory. A complimentary numerical study was simultaneously conducted to ascertain the appropriateness of the experimental parameters (particle size, particle density, medium density, medium viscosity, and rotational speed) that ensure simulated microgravity conditions for the glass particles in the HARV. Physiological solutions (pH 7.4) with and without electrolytes, and also with serum proteins, were used to study the change in surface character resulting from simulated microgravity. Control tests at normal gravity, both static and dynamic, were also conducted. Solution and surface analyses revealed major effects of simulated microgravity. The rates of leaching of constituent ions (Si-, Ca-, and P-ions) were greatly increased in all solutions tested.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Echocardiographic images were prospectively acquired in 44 patients (age, 46+/-12 years; 82% women) with evidence of pulmonary hypertension (estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, 71+/-23 mm Hg) and in 44 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. Patients with intrinsic LV diseases were excluded. RV lateral wall longitudinal strain (LS) and interventricular septal (IVS) LS were reduced in the pulmonary hypertension group compared with control subjects (-15.9+/-7.6% versus -25.5+/-6.1%, P<0.001; and -17.3+/-4.4% versus -20.2+/-3.9%, P=0.002, respectively), whereas LV lateral wall LS was preserved. RV lateral wall LS and IVS LS, but not LV lateral wall LS, correlated with pulmonary artery systolic pressure (r=0.56, P<0.01; r=0.32, P<0.01) and LV eccentricity index (r=0.57, P<0.01; r=0.57, P<0.01). IVS and LV lateral wall circumferential strain (CS) were both reduced in the pulmonary hypertension group. Although IVS CS and LV lateral wall CS correlated with pulmonary artery systolic pressure and LV eccentricity index, after adjustment of CS for LV eccentricity index, differences between groups persisted for IVS CS (P<0.01) but not LV lateral wall CS (P=0.09). LV torsion was decreased in patients with pulmonary hypertension compared with control subjects (9.6+/-4.9 degrees versus 14.7+/-4.9 degrees , P<0.001). LV torsion inversely correlated with pulmonary artery systolic pressure (r=-0.39, P<0.01) and LV eccentricity index (r=-0.3, P<0.01). LV untwisting rates were similar in both groups (P=0.7). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic RV pressure overload directly affects RV longitudinal systolic deformation. RV pressure overload further influences IVS and LV geometry, which impairs LV torsion and segmental LS and CS, more for the IVS than for the free wall of the LV.",Puwanant S; Park M; Popović ZB; Tang WH; Farha S; George D; Sharp J; Puntawangkoon J; Loyd JE; Erzurum SC; Thomas JD,,2010,Circulation,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",UL1 RR024989/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States; R37 HL060917/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; R01 HL060917/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; UL1-RR024989/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States; HL60917/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; U10 HL109250/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; R01 HL060917-11/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; UL1 RR024989-03/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States,

Early and long-term results in 152 patients following unsuccessful conventional angioplasty].,"Total coronary artery occlusion is the main limiting factor of non-surgical recanalization procedures. With conventional methods, recanalization of total occlusions older than 6 months has a low success rate. Low-speed rotational angioplasty (ROTACS, Osypka, Medtronic) was employed in 152 patients with chronic coronary occlusions in whom conventional guide wire techniques failed. The average success rate was 60% and, although not correlated to site of occlusion, revealed a clear correlation to the duration of the occlusion: 93% (1-3 months), 74% (4-6 months), 52% (6-12 months) and 8% (greater than 12 months). Emergency surgery was needed in 2 patients in whom an attempt was made to recanalize an occluded LAD branch. In both cases, the occlusion was located in the immediate vicinity of the main trunk of the left coronary artery. Thereafter, this anatomical situation was considered a contraindication and no further complications occurred in the subsequent 120 patients. Among the 152 patients, no deaths, no myocardial infarction and no perforation of the vessel wall occurred.

rotating_wall,11168217,Anatomical aspects of sinus floor elevations.,"Inadequate bone height in the lateral part of the maxilla forms a contra-indication for implant surgery. This condition can be treated with an internal augmentation of the maxillary sinus floor. This sinus floor elevation, formerly called sinus lifting, consists of a surgical procedure in which a top hinge door in the lateral maxillary sinus wall is prepared and internally rotated to a horizontal position. The new elevated sinus floor, together with the inner maxillary mucosa, will create a space that can be filled with graft material. Sinus lift procedures depend greatly on fragile structures and anatomical variations. The variety of anatomical modalities in shape of the inner aspect of the maxillary sinus defines the surgical approach. Conditions such as sinus floor convolutions, sinus septum, transient mucosa swelling and narrow sinus may form a (usually relative) contra-indication for sinus floor elevation. Absolute contra-indications are maxillary sinus diseases (tumors) and destructive former sinus surgery (like the Caldwell-Luc operation). The lateral sinus wall is usually a thin bone plate, which is easily penetrated with rotating or sharp instruments. The fragile Schneiderian membrane plays an important role for the containment of the bonegraft. The surgical procedure of preparing the trap door and luxating it, together with the preparation of the sinus mucosa, may cause a mucosa tear. Usually, when these perforations are not too large, they will fold together when turning the trap door inward and upward, or they can be glued with a fibrin sealant, or they can be covered with a resorbable membrane. If the perforation is too large, a cortico-spongious block graft can be considered. However, in most cases the sinus floor elevation will be deleted. Perforations may also occur due to irregularities in the sinus floor or even due to immediate contact of sinus mucosa with oral mucosa. Obstruction of the antro-nasal foramen is, due to its high location, not a likely complication, nor is the occurrence of severe haemorrhages since the trap door is in the periphery of the supplying vessels. Apart from these two aspects, a number of anatomical considerations are described in connection with sinus floor elevation.",van den Bergh JP; ten Bruggenkate CM; Disch FJ; Tuinzing DB,,2000,Clinical oral implants research,Journal Article; Review,,

METHODS: We compared UAS laparoscopic intracorporeal small bowel mesentery re-section with an equivalent procedure performed with BE in a porcine model. Resection was defined as 12 end-arcade arteries supplying the intended bowel segment. Vessels were divided one cm off the bowel wall. Aside from shaft diameter, jaws gaping pattern, and cutting blade length, UAS and BE devices were well matched for handle ergonomics, jaws gaping extent, power setting, type of use, working shaft axial rotation, and length. A pathologist blind to the method used assessed the collateral thermal damage. Resections were allocated to either method by computer-generated block randomization. The study design was sequential triangular with a 5% significance level and 90% power. RESULTS: No significant differences occurred in intraoperative blood pressure and heart rate variations in pigs undergoing UAS or BE. Median operating time (measured after 10, 20, and 30 resections in each study arm) was significantly shorter in UAS than in BS (0.57 vs. 2.01 min P < 0.001). Histology of small bowel wall specimens revealed no collateral thermal damage.

Using short rotation coppice willow (SRCW) as vegetal filter has several environmental and economic benefits. Here, we investigated the effect of primary wastewater irrigation on wood structure and composition of the willow cultivar Salix miyabeana 'SX67' following two years of growth. Compared to unirrigated plants (UI), stem sections of plants irrigated with primary wastewater (WWD) showed an unexpected decrease of hydraulic conductance (K(S)) associated with a decrease in vessel density but not vessel diameter. The majority (86%) of vessels had diameters range groups [20-30[, [30-40[and [40-50[µm and contributed to > 75% of theoretical K(S), while the group class [50-60[µm (less than 10% of vessels) still accounted for > 20% of total K(S) regardless irrigation treatments. WWD significantly alters the chemical composition of wood with an increase of glucan content by 9 to 16.4% and a decrease of extractives by 35.3 to 36.4% when compared to UI or to plants irrigated with potable water (PW). The fertigation did also increase the proportion of the tension wood which highly correlated with glucan content. In the context of energetic transition and mitigation of climate change, such results are of high interest since WWD effectively permit the phytofiltration of large amounts of organic contaminated effluents without impairing SRCW physiology.",Jerbi A; Laur J; Lajoie K; Gallant PP; Barnabé S; Pitre FE; Labrecque M,cell wall composition; hydraulic conductance; phytofiltration; sustainable biomass; wastewater; willow,2023,Frontiers in plant science,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,19553143,Hemodynamics and rupture of terminal cerebral aneurysms.,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between hemodynamics patterns and aneurysmal rupture in cerebral aneurysms of the same morphology regardless their location. Particularly, terminal aneurysms in both the anterior and posterior circulation were studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 42 patient-specific vascular models were constructed from three-dimensional rotational angiography images. All patients had terminal aneurysms at different arteries: a) middle cerebral; b) anterior communicating; c) internal carotid (terminus); d) internal carotid-posterior communicating; e) basilar; or f) anterior cerebral. Hemodynamics information (intra-aneurysmal velocity and wall shear stress distributions) was derived from image-based computational fluid dynamics models with realistic patient-specific anatomies. RESULTS: The group of aneurysms with an inflow jet that splits in two secondary jets, one of which enters the aneurysm before reaching one of the daughter vessels (type B), had the highest peak wall shear stress (WSS) and the highest rupture rate. The peak WSS averaged over each flow type showed a higher value in the ruptured group. The average peak WSS in the ruptured group (all types) was 188 dyn/cm(2) (compared to 118 dyn/cm(2) for the unruptured). CONCLUSIONS: This finding is in agreement with a previous work in which only anterior communicating artery aneurysms were investigated. The significance of these findings is that, if they are statistically confirmed with larger number of cases, flow types could be directly observed during angiographic examinations and linked to WSS categories that may help evaluate which aneurysms are more likely to rupture.",Castro M; Putman C; Radaelli A; Frangi A; Cebral J,,2009,Academic radiology,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,11409684,Impairment of antigen-specific cellular immune responses under simulated microgravity conditions.,"Microgravity has been implicated to play a role in the observed immune dysfunction of astronauts and cosmonauts after either short-term or long-term space travel. These reports, together with studies describing increased levels of microorganisms in the space cabin environment suggest potential risk for in-flight incidences of infectious diseases. In order to understand the mechanism underlying these immune defects, it is important to have a ground-based model that would reliably mimic the effects of microgravity on antigen-specific immune function. We tested the utility of the rotating wall vessel (RWV) technology developed at NASA as a model system because in the RWV the culture medium and the cells rotate synchronously with the vessel, thereby creating simulated microgravity conditions. We compared the RWV to the conventional tissue culture flask (T-flask), for culturing immune precursor cells with cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity against synthetic viral peptides. We observed a significant loss of antigen-specific CTL activity in RWV cultures, but not in those from the T-flask, irrespective of the peptide immunogen used for inducing the primary immune response in different mouse strains. Loss of CTL activity in RWV cultures coincided with a significant reduction in CD8+ cells as well as CD4+ cells and DEC205+ dendritic cells, suggesting adverse effects of RWV culturing on both the effector and accessory cells for the loss of antigen-specific CTL function. These results provide a strong parallel to the reported defects in cell-mediated immunity during space travel and strongly support the utility of the RWV technology as an effective ground-based model for identifying key steps in immune cell dysfunction related to microgravity.",Sastry KJ; Nehete PN; Savary CA,,2001,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

The authors set out to evaluate the relative performance of morphological features for rupture status discrimination in the context of the divergent geometrical and hemodynamic characteristics of sidewall- and bifurcation-type aneurysms. METHODS: Catheter 3D rotational angiographic images of 271 consecutive aneurysms (101 ruptured, 135 bifurcation type) were used to assess the following parameters in 3D: maximum diameter (D(max)), height, height/width ratio, aspect ratio, size ratio, nonsphericity index, and inflow angle. Univariate statistics applied to the bifurcation, sidewall, and combined (bifurcation + sidewall) sets identified significant features for inclusion in multivariate analysis yielding area under the curve (AUC) and optimal thresholds in the receiver-operating characteristic. Furthermore, a computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed to evaluate the flow and wall shear stress conditions inside sidewall and bifurcation aneurysms at different inflow angles. RESULTS: The mean D(max), height, and inflow angle were significantly greater in ruptured sidewall aneurysms than in unruptured sidewall aneurysms, but showed no difference between ruptured and unruptured bifurcation lesions. There was a statistically significant difference between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms for all measured features in the combined set. Multivariate analysis identified the following: 1) nonsphericity index as the only rupture status discriminator in bifurcation lesions (AUC = 0.67); 2) height/width ratio, size ratio, and inflow angle as strong discriminators in sidewall lesions (AUC = 0.87); and 3) height/width ratio, inflow angle, and size ratio as intermediate discriminators in the combined group (AUC = 0.76). Computational fluid dynamics analysis showed that although increasing inflow angle in a sidewall model led to deeper penetration of flow, higher velocities, and higher wall shear stress inside the aneurysm dome, it produced the exact opposite results in a bifurcation model. CONCLUSIONS: Retrospective morphological and hemodynamic analysis point to a dichotomy between sidewall and bifurcation aneurysms with respect to performance of shape and size parameters in identifying rupture status, suggesting the need for aneurysm type-based analyses in future studies. The current most commonly used clinical risk assessment metric, D(max), was found to be of no value in differentiating between ruptured and unruptured bifurcation aneurysms.",Baharoglu MI; Lauric A; Gao BL; Malek AM,,2012,Journal of neurosurgery,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",R21HL102685/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,

The hydrodynamic environment associated with many bioreactors enhances nutrient transport, but also introduces fluid shear stress, which may influence cellular response. This study examined the combined effects of hydrogel cross-linking and the hydrodynamic environment on early chondrocyte response. Specifically, chondrocytes were encapsulated in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels having two different cross-linked structures, corresponding to a low and high cross-linking density. Both cross-linked gels yielded high water contents (92% and 79%, respectively) and mesh sizes of 150 and 60 A respectively. Cell-laden PEG hydrogels were cultured in rotating wall vessels (RWV) or under static cultures for up to 5 days. Rotating cultures yielded low fluid shear stresses (< or = 0.11 Pa) at the hydrogel periphery indicating a laminar hydrodynamic environment. Chondrocyte response was measured through total DNA content, total nitric oxide (NO) production, and matrix deposition for glycosaminoglycans (GAG). In static cultures, gel cross-linking had no effect on DNA content, NO production, or GAG production; although GAG production increased with culture time for both cross-linked gels. In rotating cultures, DNA content increased, NO production decreased, and overall GAG production decreased when compared to static controls for the low cross-linked gels. For the high cross-linked gels, the hydrodynamic environment had no effect on DNA content, but exhibited similar results to the low cross-linked gel for NO production, and matrix production. Our findings demonstrated that at early culture times, when there is limited matrix production, the hydrodynamic environment dramatically influences cell response in a manner dependent on the gel cross-linking, which may impact long-term tissue development.",Villanueva I; Klement BJ; von Deutsch D; Bryant SJ,,2009,Biotechnology and bioengineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",5P20RR11104/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States; K22 DE016608/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States,

A blood pump that would augment pressure in the cavopulmonary circulation is needed, and would lead to a reduction in elevated systemic venous pressure, and improve cardiac output. Thus, we are developing a collapsible, percutaneously inserted, axial flow blood pump to support the cavopulmonary circulation in adult patients with a failing single ventricle physiology. This collapsible axial flow pump is designed for percutaneous positioning. The outer protective cage will be designed with radially arranged filaments as touchdown surfaces to protect the vessel wall from the rotating components. This study examined the geometric characteristics of the protective cage of filaments and the impeller through the development and numerical analysis of 13 models. A blood damage analysis was also performed on selected geometric models to assess the probability of blood trauma. All models demonstrated an acceptable hydraulic performance by delivering 2-6 L/min at a rotational speed of 6000-10 000 rpm and generating pressure rise of 5-20 mm Hg. Expected trends in the hydraulic performance of the pump models were found. This study represents the initial first design phase of the impeller and protective cage of filaments.

METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with main right thoracic AIS were divided into 2 groups. Group A included 13 females and 1 male with an average age of 14.3 years old and average main thoracic Cobb angle of 44.9 degrees, these patients underwent mini-incision thoracic anterior spinal fusion. Group B included 12 females and 3 males with an average age of 14.2 years old and average main thoracic Cobb angle of 46.4 degrees, all of them were treated with posterior spinal fusion. Patients underwent CT scanning from T5 to T12 Pre-and post-operatively. Five parameters pertaining to the spatial relations between the vertebral body and the thoracic aorta including the angle for safety screw placement (gamma), the angle of the aorta relative to the vertebral body (beta), vertebral rotation angle (gamma), distance from the aorta to the closest point of the vertebral body cortex (a) and distance from the posterior wall of the aorta to the anterior edge of the left rib head (b) were analyzed and were correlated with the curve correction. RESULTS: In Group A, the alpha angle and 3 angle increased while gamma decreased after curve correction, and significant difference were found at T8 and T9 levels (P < 0.05); the a value decreased and b value increased after curve correction and reached significant difference at T9 (P < 0.05). No significant change of these parameters was found in Group B post-operatively. In Group A, the increment of alpha angle, beta angle and b value show great correlation with the decrement of gamma angle (P < 0.01). At the periapical the increment of alpha angle, beta angle and b value show great correlation with decrement of apical vertebral translation, while decrement of a value show great correlation with increment of kyphosis from T5 to T12 (P < 0.01).

Twenty anesthetized dogs were ventilated with a constant tidal volume (20 ml/kg) of 100% oxygen. Oleic acid (0.09 ml/kg) was injected into the right atrium while rotating the animals through 360 degrees in 4 stages.

rotating_wall,8725731,Reduced effect of aspirin on thrombus formation at high shear and disturbed laminar blood flow.,"Aspirin is the most commonly used antithrombotic drug in primary and secondary prophylaxis against cardio- and cerebrovascular disease. In previous studies from our laboratory it was demonstrated that the effect of aspirin on collagen-induced thrombus formation in a parallel- plate perfusion device with laminar blood flow is shear rate dependent. Although aspirin did not affect collagen-induced thrombus formation at 650 s-1 (medium sized arteries), a significant inhibition of thrombus formation by approximately 38% at 2,600 s-1 (moderately stenoses in medium sized arteries) was observed. At present we have extended these studies to thrombus formation at the apex of eccentric stenoses in a parallel-plate perfusion chamber device. The stenoses reduced the cross-sectional area of the blood flow channel of the perfusion chambers by 60 or 80%, introducing disturbed laminar flow and apex wall shear rates of 2,600 and 10,500 s-1, respectively. The corresponding wall shear stresses were 80 and 315 dynes/cm2, respectively. Aspirin reduced the platelet thrombus volume at the 60% stenosis by 45% (p < 0.03), and the fibrin deposition by 70% (p < 0.004). However, none of these parameters were affected by aspirin at the 80% stenosis. These observations may at least partly explain why aspirin has a limited clinical effect in preventing arterial thrombus formation in atherosclerotic vessels at high shear and disturbed blood flow. In contrast, thrombus formation in blood from one patient with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia and two patients with von Willebrand disease subtype 2M was almost abolished at this blood flow condition. Thus, blocking the function of either von Willebrand factor or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa may represent better antithrombotic approaches for such critical events than blocking the prostaglandin metabolism by aspirin. The lack of effect of aspirin on thrombus formation at the 80% stenosis may reflect shear-induced platelet activation at the stenosis inlet region, since shear-induced platelet aggregation in rotational viscometers is not affected by aspirin at shear stresses exceeding 100 dynes/cm2.",Barstad RM; Orvim U; Hamers MJ; Tjønnfjord GE; Brosstad FR; Sakariassen KS,,1996,Thrombosis and haemostasis,Journal Article,,

The tissues were transplanted into a myocardial infarction nude rat model, and cardiac performance was evaluated.

In the present communication, a new type of small-diameter graft with a swirl flow guider was proposed to improve graft patency rate. Flow pattern in the graft was simulated numerically and compared with that in a conventional graft. The numerical results revealed that the swirl flow guider could indeed make the blood flow rotate in the new graft. The swirling flow distal to the flow guider significantly altered the flow pattern in the new graft and the velocity profiles were re-distributed. Due to the swirling flow, the blood velocity near the vessel wall and wall shear rate were greatly enhanced. We believe that the increased blood velocity near the wall and the wall shear rate can impede the occurrence of acute thrombus formation and intimal hyperplasia, hence can improve the graft patency rate for long-term clinical use.",Zhang Z; Fan Y; Deng X; Wang G; Zhang H; Guidoin R,,2008,"Science in China.

rotating_wall,7634302,[Mechanisms of transluminal mechanical coronary recanalization].,"Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) represents one of the most diffuse technique for myocardial revascularization in coronary artery disease patients. The principal mechanisms, responsible for the luminal increment after successful balloon dilatation are stretching of the vessel wall and splitting of the plaque and its rearrangement in an increased cross section of the vessel. Soon after balloon deflation elastic recoil of the vessel wall might occur at different grades which result in a partial loss of the result achieved by balloon PTCA. This phenomenon seems to be one of the major factors influencing the acute and long-term results of PTCA. Balloon inflation is also followed by endothelial denudation and intramural hemorrhage and intramural thrombus apposition. Then, a proliferative process takes place which is characterised by intimal and smooth muscle proliferation and migration. This process, beside the elastic recoil of the vessel wall, might also contribute to restenosis following balloon PTCA. Other devices for myocardial revascularization were introduced in the clinical practice based on different mechanisms from that of conventional PTCA. Transluminal atherectomy (directional, rotational and rotational-ablation) is based on the removal of plaque material from the vessel, increasing the lumen and creating a smooth surface. By this mechanism of action, plaque splitting and vessel wall stretching might be avoided, thus acute and long-term results are supposed to be improved as compared to balloon angioplasty. Another device for the removal of plaque material is represented by laser angioplasty which utilizes laser energy for the evaporation of the atherosclerotic material and the increase of vessel lumen without vessel wall stretching and plaque splitting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Sheiban I; Tonni S; Gorni R; Trevi G,,1994,"Cardiologia (Rome, Italy)",English Abstract; Journal Article,,

A computer simulation environment has been developed to provide such training. The simulation is based on an algorithm specifically developed to simulate the motion of a guide wire--the main instrument used during these interventions--in the human vasculature. In this paper, the design and model of the computer simulation environment is described and first results obtained with phantom and patient data are presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To simulate minimally invasive vascular interventions, a discrete representation of a guide wire is used which allows modeling of guide wires with different physical properties. An algorithm for simulating the propagation of a guide wire within a vascular system, on the basis of the principle of minimization of energy, has been developed. Both longitudinal translation and rotation are incorporated as possibilities for manipulating the guide wire. The simulation is based on quasi-static mechanics.

rotating_wall,17036784,Noninvasive field measurement of low-frequency ultrasonic transducers operating in sealed vessels.,"This paper describes a noninvasive technique utilizing the acousto-optic effect, laser interferometry, and tomographic principles that have been implemented to measure the acoustic fields generated by low-frequency ultrasonic transducers operating into sealed, water-loaded vessels commonly used in industrial processing applications. A customized scanning frame, incorporating both linear and rotational stages, has been developed to facilitate manipulation of the laser head and vessel under evaluation. First, transmitted pressure profiles in air are predicted from surface displacement data acquired directly by laser measurement of the vibrating aperture. These profiles were then used to verify the measured fields obtained via conventional tomographic scanning procedures, coupled with laser interferometry, applied within a draft-proof scanning facility under free-field conditions. Next, the finite element code PZF(lex) was employed for the prediction of pressure fields within cylindrical cell configurations. Finally, precise manipulation of the laser firing angle and position was implemented in order to compensate for the effects of refraction at the cell wall boundaries, and to re-establish the projections required for the reconstruction algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate good corroboration with the PZF(lex) predictions, validating its application of ultrasound as a virtual prototyping tool for the design of high power ultrasonic test vessels.",Harvey G; Gachagan A,,2006,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control","Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,32760791,Caesarean Section of Multifetal Pregnancy.,"Planned caesarean delivery (CD) did not significantly decrease or increase the risk of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal morbidity in twin pregnancy between 32 (0/7) and 38 (6/7) weeks of gestation, with the first twin in the vertex presentation. As prevalence rises for the second twin, emergency CD is necessary for delivery of the second twin after vaginal delivery of the first twin. Waiting after 38 weeks' gestation essentially requires close fetal and maternal surveillance to identify if those pregnancies may benefit to extend a gestational period. It is important to construct a system in which an emergency CD can be performed anytime. The caesarean section does not change in even multifetal pregnancy. Each step after laparotomy has few tips: (1) because the uterus strongly leans to the right, image the uterine rotation. To avoid thick vessels on the uterine lateral wall, perform long U -shaped incision using a scissor. 2) Ensure not to rupture the membrane of the second twin before delivery of the first twin. (3) Check the presentation of the second twin before rupture of that fetus's membrane. The second twin tends to change the presentation. If the upper uterine segment will clamp down and entrap the second twin, a vertical uterine incision is performed without hesitation. Women with multifetal pregnancy are at increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Mainly PPH is caused by uterine atony. Oxytocin should be prepared before starting the CD.

rotating_wall,20359974,The pedicled 'propeller' deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap for a large abdominal wall defect.,"The deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap has become a popular free flap for use in breast reconstruction, providing a versatile volume of tissue with low donor site morbidity and in particular its ease of direct donor site closure. While its use in free tissue transfer has been widely reported, its use as a local pedicled flap has been more scarcely described. Limited reports include its use for hip and groin defects and in penile reconstruction. A long and robust vascular pedicle is ideal for islanded local advancement or so-called 'propeller' rotation to adjacent abdominal wall defects, with Seyhan and Borman (2008) describing such a technique for coverage of the lower abdominal wall, and we have described such a technique to aid closure of the lower abdominal wall during contralateral DIEP flap harvest. Having been presented with a large central-lower anterior abdominal wall defect, we describe a further application of the pedicled 'propeller' DIEP flap. Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We designed a novel, customized bioreactor for use as a bioartificial liver (patent pending). The Innsbruck Bioartificial Liver (IBAL) contains aggregates of porcine hepatocytes grown under simulated microgravity. The culture vessel rotates around its longitudinal axis and is perfused by two independent circuits. The circuit responsible for exchange of plasma components with the patient consists of a dialysis tube winding spirally around the internal wall of the culture vessel. IBAL was evaluated in vitro. Viability tests showed sufficient viability of hepatocytes for up to 10 days. Cytologic examination of samples from the bioreactor showed liver cell aggregates. These were also examined by electron microscopy. A number of biochemical parameters were analyzed. In conclusion, cell culture is possible for at least 10 days in the IBAL system, organoid hepatocyte aggregates are formed and synthetic activity of the hepatocytes was demonstrated.",Hochleitner B; Hengster P; Duo L; Bucher H; Klima G; Margreiter R,,2005,Artificial organs,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained for audit of a prospectively kept database from July 2012 to July 2021, which followed outcomes of patients who received a low-tension pre-gerotal fat patch renorrhaphy at open PN. Patient demographics, intraoperative measures, histological outcomes and post-operative complications were analysed. Using a retroperitoneal approach, the peritoneum was mobilised and a vascularised pedicle of pre-gerotal fat was rotated in the direction of the kidney. Routine definition of the hilum, clamping of the hilar vessels and dissection of mass followed. After watertight closure and haemostasis, the harvested pre-gerotal fat patch was placed over the defect and secured using low-tension renorrhaphy. Two-layer closure of the abdominal wall with placement of a drain was routine. RESULTS: A total of 55 patients underwent open PN. Mean age was 60.4 (35-77) years. There were 38 men and 17 women, and 32 right and 23 left PNs. Mean mass size was 31.9 mm (10-95 mm) and collecting system was breached in 36.5% of cases. One patient (1.9%) suffered a Clavien-Dindo IIIb complication requiring return to theatre and transfusion due to a bleed from an intercostal artery. There were no renal bed bleeds, urine leaks or urine fistulas detected. Mean intraoperative blood loss was 355 mL (50-1500 mL) and mean post-operative creatinine increased by 10.7 μmol/L (51-172 μmol/L). Mean follow up was 40.2 (4-109) months. CONCLUSION: Utilisation of an anatomical pre-gerotal fat patch to provide pressure at the renorrhaphy site during open PN is an effective technique to assist with surgical haemostasis. This simple technique avoids the costs of haemostatic agents, whilst adding minimal operating time to procedures.

rotating_wall,24506844,Evaluation of carotid artery elasticity changes in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is one of the most common causes of cardiovascular disease as it causes arterial stiffness changes. The purpose of this study is to characterize, in vivo, carotid arterial structural and functional changes by applying radio frequency and X-strain ultrasound techniques. METHODS: Ninety-one subjects were assigned into two groups; a diabetes group and a control group. Structural and functional changes in the common carotid arterial wall were investigated by quality intima-media thickness (QIMT), quality arterial stiffness (QAS), and X-strain analysis with a Mylab Twice ultrasound instrument. The relationships among variables between the two groups were analyzed in this study. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in carotid IMT (626.5 ± 169.1 μm vs. 568.5 ± 122.6 μm, P = 0.1506) between two groups. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and stiffness index (β) were remarkably greater (8.388 ± 3.254 m/s vs. 7.269 ± 1.332 m/s; 12.51 ± 14.16 vs.9.279 ± 2.871), while compliance coefficient (CC) decreased significantly in the diabetes group (0.802 ± 0.3094 mm2/Kpa vs. 0.968 ± 0.3992 mm2/Kpa) (P < 0.05). The displacement difference of radial (RD-D), longitudinal (LD-D) and rotation (ROT-D) directions were significantly different between two groups' comparison (P = 0.0212, P = 0.0235 and P = 0.0072, respectively). The time of circumferential peak strain difference (CS-DT) and the time of radial peak strain rate (RSR-T) were found to be significantly different between the two groups (341.9 ± 77.56 ms vs. 369.0 ± 78.26 ms, P = 0.0494; 142.7 ± 22.43 ms vs. 136.2 ± 30.70 ms, P = 0.0474). CS-TD and RSR-T were also found to be positively correlated with CC value (r = 0.3908, P < 0.005 and r = 0.3027, P = 0.0326, respectively). Finally, PWV was negatively correlated with CC with (r = -0.6177, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In type 2 diabetes, the functional changes in CCA can be identified using the methods presented in this article earlier than the structural changes. Arterial stiffness values provided by QAS and X-strain analysis can be used as indicators of CCA functional lesions in patients with type 2 diabetes.",Zhang L; Yin JK; Duan YY; Liu X; Xu L; Wang J; Yang YL; Yuan LJ; Cao TS,,2014,Cardiovascular diabetology,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,35532736,Development of a Novel Perfusion Rotating Wall Vessel Bioreactor with Ultrasound Stimulation for Mass-Production of Mineralized Tissue Constructs.,"BACKGROUND: As stem cells are considered a promising cell source for tissue engineering, many culture strategies have been extensively studied to generate in vitro stem cell-based tissue constructs. However, most approaches using conventional tissue culture plates are limited by the lack of biological relevance in stem cell microenvironments required for neotissue formation. In this study, a novel perfusion rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor was developed for mass-production of stem cell-based 3D tissue constructs. METHODS: An automated RWV bioreactor was fabricated, which is capable of controlling continuous medium perfusion, highly efficient gas exchange with surrounding air, as well as low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) stimulation. Embryonic stem cells encapsulated in alginate/gelatin hydrogel were cultured in the osteogenic medium by using our bioreactor system. Cellular viability, growth kinetics, and osteogenesis/mineralization were thoroughly evaluated, and culture media were profiled at real time. The in vivo efficacy was examined by a rabbit cranial defect model. RESULTS: Our bioreactor successfully maintained the optimal culture environments for stem cell proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and mineralized tissue formation during the culture period. The mineralized tissue constructs produced by our bioreactor demonstrated higher void filling efficacy in the large bone defects compared to the group implanted with hydrogel beads only. In addition, the LIPUS modules mounted on our bioreactor successfully reached higher mineralization of the tissue constructs compared to the groups without LIPUS stimulation. CONCLUSION: This study suggests an effective biomanufacturing strategy for mass-production of implantable mineralized tissue constructs from stem cells that could be applicable to future clinical practice.",Cha JM; Hwang YS; Kang DK; Lee J; Cooper ES; Mantalaris A,3D mineralized tissue constructs; Low-intensity ultrasound; Perfusion; Rotating wall vessel bioreactor; Stem cells,2022,Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,15174088,Hypoxia suppresses runx2 independent of modeled microgravity.,"Bone loss is a consequence of skeletal unloading as seen in bed rest and space flight. Unloading decreases oxygenation and osteoblast differentiation/function in bone. Previously we demonstrated that simulation of unloading in vitro, by culturing differentiating mouse osteoblasts in a horizontal rotating wall vessel (RWV), results in suppressed expression of runx2, a master transcriptional regulator of osteoblast differentiation. However, the RWV is able to reproduce in a controlled fashion at least two aspects of disuse that are directly linked, model microgravity and hypoxia. Hypoxia in the RWV is indicated by reduced medium oxygen tension and increased expression of GAPDH and VEGF. To uncouple the role of model microgravity from hypoxia in suppressed runx2 expression, we cultured osteoblasts under modeled microgravity (oxygenated, horizontal RWV rotation), hypoxia (vertical RWV rotation), or both conditions (horizontal RWV rotation). The expression, DNA binding activity and promoter activity of runx2, was suppressed under hypoxic but not normoxic modeled microgravity RWV conditions. Consistent with a role for hypoxia in suppression of runx2, direct exposure to hypoxia alone is sufficient to suppress runx2 expression in osteoblasts grown in standard tissue culture plates. Taken together, our findings indicate that hypoxia associated with skeletal unloading could be major suppressor of runx2 expression leading to suppressed osteoblast differentiation and bone formation.",Ontiveros C; Irwin R; Wiseman RW; McCabe LR,NASA Discipline Cell Biology; NASA Discipline Cell Biotechnology; Non-NASA Center,2004,Journal of cellular physiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",DK061184/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States; MA00210/PHS HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,30035069,Development of a whole organ culture model for intervertebral disc disease.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Whole organ in vitro intervertebral disc models have been associated with poor maintenance of cell viability. No previous studies have used a rotating wall vessel bioreactor for intervertebral disc explants culture. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro model for the assessment of biological and biomechanical measures of intervertebral disc health and disease. METHODS: To this end, endplate-intervertebral disc-endplate whole organ explants were harvested from the tails of rats. For the injured group, the annulus fibrosus was penetrated with a 20G needle to the nucleus pulposus and aspirated. Explants were cultured in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor for 14 days. RESULTS: Cell viability and histologic assessments were performed at Day 0, Day 1, Day 7, and Day 14. Compressive mechanical properties of the intervertebral disc were assessed at Day 0 and Day 14. In the annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus cells, the uninjured group maintained high viability through 14 days of culture, whereas cell viability in annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus of the injured intervertebral discs was markedly lower at Day 7 and Day 14. Histologically, the uninjured intervertebral discs maintained cell viability and tissue morphology and architecture through 14 days, whereas the injured intervertebral discs showed areas of cell death, loss of extracellular matrix integrity, and architecture by Day 14. Stiffness values for uninjured intervertebral discs were similar at Day 0 and Day 14, whereas the stiffness for the injured intervertebral discs was approximately 2.5 times greater at Day 14. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that whole organ intervertebral discs explants can be successfully cultured in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor to maintain cell viability and tissue architecture in both annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus for at least 14 days. In addition, the injury used produced pathologic changes consistent with those seen in degenerative intervertebral disc disease in humans.

We examined the effects of flow, induced by orbital rotation of bEnd.3 brain endothelial cell cultures for 1 wk, on ox-LDL receptor (LOX-1) protein expression, ox-LDL uptake and ox-LDL toxicity. Orbitally rotated cultures showed no changes in LOX-1 protein expression, ox-LDL uptake or ox-LDL toxicity, compared to stationary cultures.

METHODS: Rotator cuff tendons from 83 cadavers aged 11-94 and tendon biopsy specimens from 20 patients with lateral epicondylitis aged 27-56 years were examined histologically. RESULTS: The microscopic changes found in the tendon biopsies from the elbow were similar to those found in the cadaveric rotator cuff tendons. Abnormalities ranged from minor blood vessel wall changes and loss of tenocytes to calcification. The most frequent abnormality was glycosaminoglycan infiltration and fibrocartilaginous transformation. There appeared to be some sequence in the changes observed which were milder in younger patients. Only 17% of cadaver tendons, below the age of 39 were abnormal but abnormalities increase in later life to around 40-50%. CONCLUSIONS: There was an increasing incidence of degenerative changes in tendons with age.

Considering this, hollow fiber (HF) membrane module treated as a cell carrier is adopted to combine with RWVB to form a novel rotating wall hollow fiber membrane bioreactor (RWHMB) to avoid aforementioned harmful collision, since the cells cultured inside this bioreactor will mainly adhere to large specific surface of hollow fiber membrane module. Prior to cell experiment, mathematical simulations concerned with flow field inside RWHMB are performed by CFD, which includes the distributions of the total pressure, velocity, and shear stress with the variation of rotating speeds and directions, as well as the radial location and diameter of hollow fiber membrane. To further confirm the feasible parameters getting from the simulation, this RWHMB is adopted to expand osteoblasts isolated from SD rats within its dynamic conditions. Cell expansion in T-flask is carried out as a negative control. The results showed that with the same rotating direction and speed of 10 rpm, inner and outer cylinders of RWHMB generated cyclical stress stimulus, which was acceptable to cell expansion and facilitated the secretion of extracellular matrix. Besides, hollow fiber membrane carrier with a diameter of 0.2 mm has an excellent biocompatibility and their radial locations presented a tiny influence on flow field inside the culture chamber.",Song K; Yan X; Zhang Y; Song F; Lim M; Fang M; Shi F; Wang L; Liu T,,2015,Bioprocess and biosystems engineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,17487203,Real-time assessment of three-dimensional cell aggregation in rotating wall vessel bioreactors in vitro.,"Until now, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have lacked non-invasive techniques for monitoring and manipulating three-dimensional (3D) tissue assembly from specific cell sources. We have set out to create an intelligent system that automatically diagnoses and monitors cell-cell aggregation as well as controls 3D growth of tissue-like constructs (organoids) in real time. The capability to assess, in real time, the kinetics of aggregation and organoid assembly in rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors could yield information regarding the biological mechanics of tissue formation. Through prototype iterations, we have developed a versatile high-resolution 'horizontal microscope' that assesses cell-cell aggregation and tissue-growth parameters in a bioreactor and have begun steps to intelligently control the development of these organoids in vitro. The first generation system was composed of an argon-ion laser that excited fluorescent beads at 457 nm and fluorescent cells at 488 nm while each was suspended in a high-aspect rotating vessel (HARV) type RWV bioreactor. An optimized system, which we introduce here, is based on a diode pumped solid state (DPSS) green laser that emits a wavelength at 532 nm. By exciting both calibration beads and stained cells with laser energy and viewing them in real time with a charge-coupled device (CCD) video camera, we have captured the motion of individual cells, observed their trajectories, and analyzed their aggregate formation. Future development will focus on intelligent feedback mechanisms in silico to control organoid formation and differentiation in bioreactors. As to the duration of this entire multistep protocol, the laser system will take about 1 h to set up, followed by 1 h of staining either beads or cells. Inoculating the bioreactors with beads or cells and starting the system will take approximately 1 h, and the video-capture segments, depending on the aims of the experiment, can take from 30 s to 5 min each. The total duration of a specific experimental protocol will also depend on the specific cell type used and on its population-doubling times so that the required numbers of cells are obtained.",Botta GP; Manley P; Miller S; Lelkes PI,,2006,Nature protocols,Journal Article,,

MSCs harvested from male Sprague-Dawley rats were culture expanded, seeded on three-dimensional porous 75:25 poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) biodegradable scaffolds, and cultured for 21 days under static conditions or in two model bioreactors (a spinner flask and a rotating wall vessel) that enhance mixing of the media and provide better nutrient transport to the seeded cells. The spinner flask culture demonstrated a 60% enhanced proliferation at the end of the first week when compared to static culture. On day 14, all cell/polymer constructs exhibited their maximum alkaline phosphatase activity (AP). Cell/polymer constructs cultured in the spinner flask had 2.4 times higher AP activity than constructs cultured under static conditions on day 14. The total osteocalcin (OC) secretion in the spinner flask culture was 3.5 times higher than the static culture, with a peak OC secretion occurring on day 18. No considerable AP activity and OC secretion were detected in the rotating wall vessel culture throughout the 21-day culture period. The spinner flask culture had the highest calcium content at day 14. On day 21, the calcium deposition in the spinner flask culture was 6.6 times higher than the static cultured constructs and over 30 times higher than the rotating wall vessel culture. Histological sections showed concentration of cells and mineralization at the exterior of the foams at day 21. This phenomenon may arise from the potential existence of nutrient concentration gradients at the interior of the scaffolds. The better mixing provided in the spinner flask, external to the outer surface of the scaffolds, may explain the accelerated proliferation and differentiation of marrow stromal osteoblasts, and the localization of the enhanced mineralization on the external surface of the scaffolds.",Sikavitsas VI; Bancroft GN; Mikos AG,NASA Discipline Cell Biology; Non-NASA Center,2002,Journal of biomedical materials research,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",R29-AR42639/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,17410383,The anatomical relationship between the aorta and the thoracic vertebral bodies and its importance in the placement of the screw in thoracoscopic correction of scoliosis.,"Thoracoscopically-assisted anterior spinal instrumentation is being used widely to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Recent studies have showed that screws placed thoracoscopically could counter the aorta or entrance into the spinal canal. There are a few studies defining the anatomic landmarks to identify the relationship between the aorta and the thoracic vertebral body using quantitative measurement for the sake of safe placement of thoracoscopic vertebral screw in anterior correction for AIS. The CT scanning from T4 to T12 in 64 control subjects and 30 AIS patients from mainland China were analyzed manually. Parameters to be measured included the angle for safety screw placement (alpha), the angle of the aorta relative to the vertebral body (beta), the distance from the line between the left and the right rib heads to the anterior wall of the vertebral canal (a), the distance from the left rib head to posterior wall of the aorta (b), the vertebral body transverse diameter (c) and vertebral rotation (gamma). No significant differences were found between the groups with respect to age or sex. Compared with the control group, alpha angle from T7 to T10, beta angle from T5 to T10 and b value at T9, T10 were significantly lower in the scoliotic group. The a value was significantly lower in the scoliotic group. The c value showed no significant difference between the two groups. In conclusion, to place the thoracoscopic vertebral screw safely, at the cephalad thoracic spine (T4-T6), the maximum ventral excursion angle should decrease gradually from 20 degrees to 5 degrees , the entry-point of the screw should be close to the rib head. For apical vertebrae (T7-T9), the maximum ventral excursion angle increased gradually from 5 degrees to 12 degrees. At the caudal thoracic spine (T10-T12), the maximum ventral excursion angle increased, the entry-point should shift 3 approximately 5 mm ventrally.",Qiu Y; He YX; Wang B; Zhu F; Wang WJ,,2007,"European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the",Journal Article,,

The MRI vessel wall imaging findings and possible mechanism of aneurysm formation were discussed. A 5 mm extracranial vertebral artery aneurysm located at the interlaminar space between C1 and C2 was diagnosed in a woman presenting with occipital headache. The index vertebral artery ran an aberrant course at the V3 segment, where it entered the dura between C1 and C2 instead of the usual atlanto-occipital space. MR vessel wall imaging showed homogenous wall enhancement of the aneurysm sac. We surmise the anomalous course of the vertebral artery subjected the V3 segment to repeated shearing force secondary to the atlanto-axial rotational neck movement. This led to vessel wall trauma and inflammation, and subsequent aneurysm formation.

rotating_wall,32546633,Aneurysms of the communicating segment of the internal carotid artery with posterior communicating artery agenesis are associated with perforator infarction after embolization.,"BACKGROUND: While anatomic features associated with the risk of posterior communicating artery (PcoA) occlusion after embolization of aneurysms of the PcoA segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA) are well known, the link between perforator origin and perforator infarction has only been reported following neurosurgical clipping. The aim of this study was to determine the origin of anterior thalamic perforators and correlate it with risk of perforator infarction after embolization of PcoA segment aneurysms. METHODS: One-hundred-and-ninety consecutive patients treated for PcoA segment aneurysms between 2017 and 2019 were included. PcoA and anterior thalamic perforator origin anatomy was assessed with computed tomography (CT) angiography, digital subtracted angiography, and high-resolution three-dimensional rotational cone-beam CT angiography (CBCT-A) by two independent interventional neuroradiologists. The presence of perforator infarction after embolization was ascertained from the patient's notes and follow-up imaging. RESULTS: CBCT-A was superior in demonstrating the origin of perforators (P<0.001). The prevalence of perforator origin was estimated at 86% (95% CI 81%-92%) for PcoA, 8% (95% CI 4%-13%) for aneurysm wall, and 5% (95% CI 2%-9%) for ICA. The aneurysm wall origin was exclusively associated with PcoA agenesis, as well as higher risk of perforator infarction after aneurysm coiling compared with other variants (OR=14, 95% CI 2-88, P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that anterior thalamic perforators may arise from aneurysm wall when there is no PcoA. Anatomic association between PcoA agenesis and perforator arising from ICA could underlie such findings, and careful consideration is essential before aneurysm repair to anticipate the risk of thalamic infarction in such cases. permissions.

Despite the wealth of knowledge gleaned from such models, it is accepted that in vitro cell culture models using EVT-like cell lines display altered cellular properties when compared to their in vivo counterparts. Cells cultured in the rotating cell culture system (RCCS) display morphological, phenotypic, and functional properties of EVT-like cell lines that more closely mimic differentiating in utero EVTs, with increased expression of genes mediating invasion (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)) and trophoblast differentiation. The Saint Georges Hospital Placental cell Line-4 (SGHPL-4) (kindly donated by Dr. Guy Whitley and Dr. Judith Cartwright) is an EVT-like cell line that was used for testing in the RCCS. The design of the RCCS culture vessel is based on the principle that organs and tissues function in a three-dimensional (3-D) environment. Due to the dynamic culture conditions in the vessel, including conditions of physiologically relevant shear, cells grown in three dimensions form aggregates based on natural cellular affinities and differentiate into organotypic tissue-like assemblies. The maintenance of a fluid orbit provides a low-shear, low-turbulence environment similar to conditions found in vivo. Sedimentation of the cultured cells is countered by adjusting the rotation speed of the RCCS to ensure a constant free-fall of cells. Gas exchange occurs through a permeable hydrophobic membrane located on the back of the bioreactor. Like their parental tissue in vivo, RCCS-grown cells are able to respond to chemical and molecular gradients in three dimensions (i.e. at their apical, basal, and lateral surfaces) because they are cultured on the surface of porous microcarrier beads. When grown as two-dimensional monolayers on impermeable surfaces like plastic, cells are deprived of this important communication at their basal surface. Consequently, the spatial constraints imposed by the environment profoundly affect how cells sense and decode signals from the surrounding microenvironment, thus implying an important role for the 3-D milieu. We have used the RCCS to engineer biologically meaningful 3-D models of various human epithelial tissues. Indeed, many previous reports have demonstrated that cells cultured in the RCCS can assume physiologically relevant phenotypes that have not been possible with other models. In summary, culture in the RCCS represents an easy, reproducible, high-throughput platform that provides large numbers of differentiated cells that are amenable to a variety of experimental manipulations. In the following protocol, using EVTs as an example, we clearly describe the steps required to three-dimensionally culture adherent cells in the RCCS.",Zwezdaryk KJ; Warner JA; Machado HL; Morris CA; Höner zu Bentrup K,,2012,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Video-Audio Media",R01 HD051998/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States; R03 HD045768/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States; HD051998/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States,

In all 152 patients (mean age 55 years, ranging from 29 to 78 years) attempts to recanalize the coronary occlusion with conventional guidewire systems had failed. In 74/152 patients the age of the occlusion could be estimated because of a previous angiogram or clinical event. It ranged from 1-192 months (median 6 months, mean value 14 months; in 20% of patients it was 1-3, in 37% 4-6, in 28% 7-12, and in 15% greater than 12 months). The occlusion was localized in the right coronary artery (RCA) in 86 cases, in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in 37 cases, and in the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery in 17 cases. Eleven bypass occlusions were treated. One patient had a LAD and RCA occlusion. Out of 152 patients 84 could be recanalized. The success rate rose with experience from 30% to 60%. It was 55% in the LAD, 52% in the RCA, 70% in the circumflex branch, and 63% in bypass grafts. The success rate in relation to the age of the occlusion was 93% in occlusions of 1-3 month duration, 74% in occlusions of 4-6 months duration, 52% in occlusions of 6-12 months duration, and 8% in occlusions older than 12 months. Seventy-six of the successfully treated patients underwent follow-up angiography after 4 months. In 56/76 (74%) the vessel remained open. Twenty-two patients (29%) had restenosis that was successfully dilated in 21 patients. Twenty patients (26%) had reocclusion. Thus, the angiographically determined long-term success rate was 72%. Emergency operation was necessary in two patients in whom reopening of the LAD was attempted although the occlusion was located directly at the take-off of the LAD from the left main. Since this type of occlusion was consequently considered a contraindication, no further serious complications occurred. There was one myocardial infarction, no death, no vessel wall perforation or other complications in the 152 patients. It is concluded that low speed ROTACS is a safe technique that can be applied in chronic coronary occlusions even if the duration of occlusion exceeds 6 months.",Kaltenbach M; Vallbracht C; Hartmann A,,1991,Journal of interventional cardiology,Journal Article,,

Robust in vitro models of the female reproductive tract are urgently needed to better understand the biological mechanisms leading to these pathophysiological changes. Our human three-dimensional (3D) endometrial epithelial cell (EEC) model, which is generated using the HEC-1A cell line and rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology, replicates several hallmarks of endometrial tissue in vivo. Studying the interactions of N. gonorrhoeae with the host using this newly characterized human 3D EEC model allows for the investigation of unique mechanisms of gonococcal pathogenesis in the upper female reproductive tract. In this chapter, we describe methodologies that can be used to investigate the interactions of N. gonorrhoeae with the human 3D endometrial epithelium.

This work investigates a three-dimensional cell-culture system to characterise the epithelial response to F. tularensis. Immortalised human pneumocytes (A549s) grown in rotating-wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors display an in vivo-like phenotype, which has been confirmed to be driven by specific transcriptional events (8454 genes, p ≤ 0.05). These data support the RWV model as a more in vivo-like culture system to investigate the lung epithelium, compared to monolayer counterparts. RWV-cultured A549s were infected with F. tularensis SchuS4 and LVS and intracellular replication mapped over 22 h compared to monolayer cells. The RWV-cultured A549s were more resistant to SchuS4 and LVS infection (p ≤ 0.05). Transcriptomics identified 2086 genes (p ≤ 0.05) as candidates for host-pathogen interactions which result in the observed increase in resistance of the RWV-cultured A549 cells. Gene and pathway analysis identified processes involved in MMP modulation, endocytosis, mucin production and the complement pathway amongst others. The role of these pathways during infection was further characterised using chemical inhibitors. This work has revealed several new hypotheses worthy of further testing in order to understand the epithelial host response to F. tularensis infection.",David J; Sayer NM; Sarkar-Tyson M,3D cell culture; A549; Francisella tularensis; Microarray; Rotating wall vessel; Transcriptome,2014,Microbes and infection,Journal Article,,

Morphological evaluation based on electron microscopy showed that hepatocyte spheroids cultured for 30 d in the HARV had a compact structure with tight cell-cell junctions, numerous smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, intact mitochondria, and bile canaliculi lined with microvilli. The viability and differentiated properties of the hepatocytes cultured in the HARV were further substantiated by the presence of both phase I oxidation and phase II conjugation drug-metabolizing enzyme activities, as well as albumin synthesis. Homogenates prepared from freshly isolated hepatocytes and hepatocytes cultured in the HARV showed similar cytochrome P450 2B activities measured as pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase and testosterone 16beta-hydroxylase. Further, intact hepatocytes cultured in the HARV were found to metabolize chlorzoxazone to 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone; dextromethorphan to dextrorphan, 3-methoxymorphinan, and 3-hydroxymorphinan; midazolam to 1-hydroxymidazolam and 4-hydroxymidazolam; and 7-hydroxycoumarin to its glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In conclusion, we found that hepatocyte spheroids could be cultured in a HARV to retain cellular and physiological properties of the intact liver, including drug-metabolizing enzyme activities, plasma protein production, and long-term (1 mo) maintenance of viability and cellular function.",Brown LA; Arterburn LM; Miller AP; Cowger NL; Hartley SM; Andrews A; Silber PM; Li AP,,2003,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

rotating_wall,8865567,The effect of variations in transducer position and sound speed in intravascular ultrasound: a theoretical study.,"The intravascular insonation of a blood vessel in the presence of an impedance interface between blood and the inner vessel wall is studied theoretically. The model, which uses a ray approximation, is three dimensional and allows consideration of arbitrary noncircular lumen shapes. Model results are presented for the image geometry, and the insonating intensity over the vessel wall. It is shown that the inner lumen can be imaged accurately with the transducer at any position within the lumen, and at any forward viewing angle, provided the point of origin of the beam is stationary. If it is not stationary but rotating with the same angular velocity as the beam itself, the inner vessel wall is not mapped accurately. A particular geometric distortion which has been observed in practice is predicted if the transducer is near vessel wall. Acoustic impedance interfaces will be encountered in vascular disease because the speed of sound in fatty plaque is less than in blood, whereas the speed of sound in fibrous and calcified plaque is greater than in blood. A simplified model representation of an atherosclerotic lumen in developed using a cardioid-like curve and a single impedance interface. Model results show that refraction at this interface leads to an intensity distribution which is not uniform around the lumen, and which depends on lumen shape and transducer position. The exception is the special case of a circular lumen with a centrally positioned transducer. Noncircular impedance interfaces encountered in vivo in vascular disease may cause considerable intensity distortion, particularly if the transducer is close to the wall in an irregularly shaped lumen.",Thompson RS; Wilson LS,,1996,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

An elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a potential biomarker candidate, as leukocyte differentials are altered during spaceflight. In the reduced gravity environment of space, rodents and astronauts displayed elevated NLR and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios (GLR), respectively. To simulate microgravity using two well-established ground-based models, we cultured human whole blood-leukocytes in high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV) and used hindlimb unloaded (HU) mice. Both HARV-RWV simulation of leukocytes and HU-exposed mice showed elevated NLR profiles comparable to spaceflight exposed samples. To assess mechanisms involved, we found the simulated microgravity HARV-RWV model resulted in an imbalance of redox processes and activation of myeloperoxidase-producing inflammatory neutrophils, while antioxidant treatment reversed these effects. In the simulated microgravity HU model, mitochondrial catalase-transgenic mice that have reduced oxidative stress responses showed reduced neutrophil counts, NLR, and a dampened release of selective inflammatory cytokines compared to wildtype HU mice, suggesting simulated microgravity induced oxidative stress responses that triggered inflammation. In brief, both spaceflight and simulated microgravity models caused elevated NLR, indicating this as a potential biomarker for future in-flight immune health monitoring.

METHOD: In an initial laboratory validation test, a silicone AAA model was imaged with a stereo-pair configuration of calibrated digital cameras using retro-reflective and ink dot surface targets. This technique was then applied to 4 aneurysm necks imaged at open surgery. In each case the paired images were measured and analyzed to produce sequences of accurate three-dimensional (3-D) surface models of the anterior aspect of the aortic neck. Engineering techniques were used to visualize and identify differences between the generated surfaces, allowing changes in shape of the aortic wall to be determined. RESULTS: The correlation between stereoscopic digital imaging with electronic caliper measurements of linear dimensions was accurate, irrespective of the type of surface targets used (r2 = 0.98). The AAA neck demonstrated complex 3-D movements that ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 mm in the radial direction to 0.6 to 1.0 mm along the longitudinal axis, with a 0.44 to 0.59-mm rotational component (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study raises questions about the validity of accepted models of arterial wall movements and compliance in which rotation has not been described. The technique used to measure dynamic neck morphology appears promising as a means to further define the mechanical parameters of the human aorta, which may assist in designing stent-grafts.",Flora HS; Woodhouse N; Robson S; Adiseshiah M,,2001,Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International,Journal Article; Validation Study,,
rotating_wall,21394929,Effects of simulated microgravity on the development of the swimbladder and buoyancy control in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio).,"The gas-filled swimbladder of teleost fishes provides hydrodynamic lift which counteracts the high density of other body tissues, and thereby allows the fish to achieve neutral buoyancy with minimal energy expenditure. In this study, we examined whether the absence of a constant direction gravitational vector affects the ontogeny of the swimbladder and buoyancy control in zebrafish (Danio rerio). We exposed fertilized eggs to simulated microgravity (SMG) in a closed rotating wall vessel with control eggs placed in a similar but nonrotating container. All eggs hatched in both groups. At 96 hr of postfertilization (hpf), all larvae were removed from the experimental and control vessels. At this point, 62% of the control larvae, but only 14% of SMG-exposed larvae, were observed to have inflated their swimbladder. In addition, the mean volume of the inflated swimbladders was significantly greater in the control larvae compared with larvae raised in SMG. After transfer to open stationary observation tanks, larvae with uninflated swimbladders in both groups swam to the surface to complete inflation, but this process was significantly delayed in larvae exposed to SMG. Initial differences in swimbladder inflation and volume between groups disappeared by 144 hpf. Furthermore, there were no apparent changes in patterns of development and maturation of swimbladder musculature, vasculature, or innervation resulting from SMG exposure at later stages of ontogeny. These data indicate that, despite a transient delay in swimbladder inflation in zebrafish larvae exposed to SMG, subsequent swimbladder development in these animals proceeded similarly to that in normal larvae.",Lindsey BW; Dumbarton TC; Moorman SJ; Smith FM; Croll RP,,2011,"Journal of experimental zoology.

rotating_wall,19281988,The role of the carotid sinus in the reduction of arterial wall stresses due to head movements--potential implications for cervical artery dissection.,"Spontaneous dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery (sICAD) is a major cause of stroke in young adults. A tear in the inner part of the vessel wall triggers sICAD as it allows the blood to enter the wall and develop a transmural hematoma. The etiology of the tear is unknown but many patients with sICAD report an initiating trivial trauma. We thus hypothesised that the site of the tear might correspond with the location of maximal stress in the carotid wall. Carotid artery geometries segmented from magnetic resonance images of a healthy subject at different static head positions were used to define a path of motion and deformation of the right cervical internal carotid artery (ICA). Maximum head rotation to the left and rotation to the left combined with hyperextension of the neck were investigated using a structural finite element model. A role of the carotid sinus as a geometrically compliant feature accommodating extension of the artery is shown. At the extreme range of the movements, the geometrical compliance of the carotid sinus is limited and significant stress concentrations appear just distal to the sinus with peak stresses at the internal wall on the posterior side of the vessel following maximum head rotation and on the anteromedial portion of the vessel wall following rotation and hyperextension. Clinically, the location of sICAD initiation is 10-30 mm distal to the origin of the cervical ICA, which corresponds with the peak stress locations observed in the model, thus supporting trivial trauma from natural head movements as a possible initiating factor in sICAD.",Callaghan FM; Soellinger M; Baumgartner RW; Poulikakos D; Boesiger P; Kurtcuoglu V,,2009,Journal of biomechanics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,10191681,The value of intravascular ultrasound in interventional cardiology.,"Intracoronary ultrasound (ICUS) is a new imaging technique with the unique ability to study vessel wall morphology in vivo, accurately displaying the details of vessel structure. The coronary angiogram represents only a projectional image of the vessel lumen without providing any information concerning vascular wall architecture. Interventional cardiology has developed over the last years with the appearance of new devices and consequently new challenges. The selection of an appropriate device and the assessment of any intervention, as well as the understanding of its mechanisms is essential to perform a better intervention. The use of a tool, such as ICUS, able to identify vessel wall anomalies, complementing coronary angiography, seems to be an appropriate method in the regard. The last years have witnessed an array of studies demonstrating the advantages and disadvantages of ICUS in the setting of interventional cardiology. Despite some contradictions in the literature, the result of a new technology still under scrutiny, it is possible to summarise some of the major achievements: Lesion assessment before coronary interventions for selection of treatment, including calcium detection, plaque eccentricity, diffuse atherosclerotic disease, type of vessel remodelling; ICUS during balloon angioplasty has helped in balloon diameter selection, identification of pseudo successful results and presence/severity of wall dissections, as well as the search of predictors of restenosis; during rotational and directional atherectomy, ICUS can help in the definition of the lesion most suitable for rotational atherectomy, showing if there is a diffuse sub endothelial calcification, excluding unsuitable lesions, selecting cut direction and directly assessing the adequacy of plaque removal; during stent implantation it helps to determine if there was a complete apposition, detect residual narrowing or proximal/distal stenoses or dissections requiring further treatment. Some new concepts have been introduced by ICUS, such as the negative remodelling as one of the mechanisms of restenosis. New developments are under way, including combined devices, looking forward ultrasound, high frequency probes, imaging wires, tissue characterisation and three dimensional technology. Therefore, ICUS has reached enough maturity to be considered an important tool in the catheterization laboratory, complementing the information provided by coronary angiography. However, some more research needs to be done to answer some important questions regarding the whole array of potential applications in an environment of cost containment as the one we live in today.",Pinto FJ,,1999,Revista portuguesa de cardiologia : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",,
rotating_wall,7801393,[Intravascular ultrasound].,"Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a new imaging modality for the study of cardiovascular disease, which enables us to visualize the structure of the wall and the inner surface of the vessel. The instrument consists of a small very high frequency ultrasound transducer (12.5-40 MHz) mounted on the tip of a catheter, which can be introduced into the vessel. By rotating either the transducer itself or a mirror situated proximal to the transducer, cross-sectional images of the vessel wall with a high resolution are obtained. IVUS can distinguish between the different layers of the vessel and between different kinds of atherosclerotic plaques. Furthermore, the changes created by various interventional procedures may be visualised. These qualities of IVUS begin to comply with the rising demands for a better assessment of the results of the interventions--demands that cannot be fulfilled by arteriography. Moreover, IVUS may contribute to vascular diagnostics without the use of x-ray and contrast media, but is limited by its invasive nature and, until now, high costs.",Vogt KC,,1994,Ugeskrift for laeger,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",,

Thirty-seven patients (5 women, 32 men, aged 60 +/- 9 years) with 41 dilated lesions were examined with a 3.5 F, 20 MHz rotational tip intravascular ultrasound imaging system before and immediately after coronary balloon angioplasty. Images were assessed for plaque composition, topography and postinterventional effects on the plaque morphology. Quantitative measurements of lumen area, total arterial area and plaque area were performed in the dilated vessel segment. Plaque morphology was concentric in 18 lesions (44%) and eccentric in 23 lesions (56%). Fourteen lesions (34%) showed no calcification, 15 lesions (37%) were superficially and 12 lesions (29%) were deeply calcified. Four distinct changes of the plaque morphology were manifested by ultrasound imaging after balloon angioplasty. Dissection with detachment of the plaque from the underlaying wall was found in 10 lesions, plaque splitting in 9 lesions, superficial tears in 6 lesions, and smooth plaque contours in 16 lesions. The incidence of dissection detected by intravascular ultrasound was significantly greater in eccentric lesions (p = 0.03) and in stenoses with a small total arterial area (p = 0.006). The incidence of dissection was significantly increased in vessels in which balloon cross-sectional area exceeded 50% of the total cross-sectional vessel area as compared to those with a smaller balloon-to-vessel ratio. Preinterventional IVUS imaging provides information about the target stenosis which can be used to assess the risk of postinterventional dissections. In addition to the size of the balloon in relation to vessel cross-sectional area, the features small total vessel cross-sectional area and eccentric stenosis morphology in the preinterventional IVUS study predispose to an increased risk of dissection. Further studies have to elucidate the influence of dissections on late outcome after angioplasty.",Füssl R; Burkhard-Meier C; Kaspers S; Deutsch HJ; Höpp HW; Sechtem U,,1995,Zeitschrift fur Kardiologie,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,21552367,Impact of Scaffold Micro and Macro Architecture on Schwann Cell Proliferation under Dynamic Conditions in a Rotating Wall Vessel Bioreactor.,"Over the last decade tissue engineering has emerged as a powerful alternative to regenerate lost tissues owing to trauma or tumor. Evidence shows that Schwann cell containing scaffolds have improved performance in vivo as compared to scaffolds that depend on cellularization post implantation. However, owing to limited supply of cells from the patients themselves, several approaches have been taken to enhance cell proliferation rates to produce complete and uniform cellularization of scaffolds. The most common approach is the application of a bioreactor to enhance cell proliferation rate and therefore reduce the time needed to obtain sufficiently significant number of glial cells, prior to implantation.In this study, we show the application of a rotating wall bioreactor system for studying Schwann cell proliferation on nanofibrous spiral shaped scaffolds, prepared by solvent casting and salt leaching techniques. The scaffolds were fabricated from polycaprolactone (PCL), which has ideal mechanical properties and upon degradation does not produce acidic byproducts. The spiral scaffolds were coated with aligned or random nanofibers, produced by electrospinning, to provide a substrate that mimics the native extracellular matrix and the essential contact guidance cues.At the 4 day time point, an enhanced rate of cell proliferation was observed on the open structured nanofibrous spiral scaffolds in a rotating wall bioreactor, as compared to static culture conditions. However, the cell proliferation rate on the other contemporary scaffolds architectures such as the tubular and cylindrical scaffolds show reduced cell proliferation in the bioreactor as compared to static conditions, at the same time point. Moreover, the rotating wall bioreactor does not alter the orientation or the phenotype of the Schwann cells on the aligned nanofiber containing scaffolds, wherein, the cells remain aligned along the length of the scaffolds. Therefore, these open structured spiral scaffolds pre-cultured with Schwann cells, in bioreactors could potentially shorten the time needed for grafts for peripheral nerve regeneration.",Valmikinathan CM; Hoffman J; Yu X,,2011,"Materials science & engineering.

rotating_wall,34715656,Vortex formation and associated aneurysmogenic transverse rotational shear stress near the apex of wide-angle cerebral bifurcations.,"OBJECTIVE: Aneurysm formation preferentially occurs at the site of wide-angle cerebral arterial bifurcations, which were recently shown to have a high longitudinal positive wall shear stress (WSS) gradient that promotes aneurysm formation. The authors sought to explore the other components of the hemodynamic environment that are altered with increasing bifurcation angle in the apical region and the effects of these components on WSS patterns on the vessel wall that may modulate aneurysm genesis and progression. METHODS: Parametric models of symmetrical and asymmetrical bifurcations were created with increasing bifurcation angles (45°-240°), and 3D rotational angiography models of 13 middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcations (7 aneurysmal, 6 controls) were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. For aneurysmal bifurcations, the aneurysm was digitally removed to uncover hemodynamics at the apex. WSS vectors along cross-sectional planes distal to the bifurcation apex were decomposed as orthogonal projections to the cut plane into longitudinal and transverse (tangential to the cross-sectional plane) components. Transverse rotational WSS (TRWSS) and TRWSS gradients (TRWSSGs) were sampled and evaluated at the apex and immediately distal from the apex. RESULTS: In parametric models, increased bifurcation angle was associated with transverse flow vortex formation with emergence of an associated apical high TRWSS with highly aneurysmogenic positive TRWSSGs. While TRWSS decayed rapidly away from the apex in narrow-angle bifurcations, it remained greatly elevated for many radii downstream in aneurysm-prone wider bifurcations. In asymmetrical bifurcations, TRWSS was higher on the aneurysm-prone daughter vessel associated with the wider angle. Patient-derived models with aneurysmal bifurcations had wider angles (149.33° ± 12.56° vs 98.17° ± 8.67°, p < 0.001), with significantly higher maximum TRWSS (1.37 ± 0.67 vs 0.48 ± 0.23 Pa, p = 0.01) and TRWSSG (1.78 ± 0.92 vs 0.76 ± 0.50 Pa/mm, p = 0.03) compared to control nonaneurysmal bifurcations. CONCLUSIONS: Wider vascular bifurcations are associated with a novel and to the authors' knowledge previously undescribed transverse component rotational wall shear stress associated with a positive (aneurysmogenic) spatial gradient. The resulting hemodynamic insult, demonstrated in both parametric models and patient-based anatomy, is noted to decay rapidly away from the protection of the medial pad in healthy narrow-angle bifurcations but remain elevated distally downstream of wide-angle aneurysm-prone bifurcations. This TRWSS serves as a new contribution to the hemodynamic environment favoring aneurysm formation and progression at wide cerebral bifurcations and may have clinical implications favoring interventions that reduce bifurcation angle.",Malek AM; Hippelheuser JE; Lauric A,bifurcation apex; flow recirculation; intracranial aneurysms; vascular disorders; wall shear stress,2022,Journal of neurosurgery,Journal Article,,

Although midterm results for anatomic correction of TGA are promising, there are reported minor alterations in left ventricular (LV) function possibly indicating myocardial dysfunction. Twenty-two patients with TGAs 12.4 +/- 2.3 years old operated with arterial switch were studied by magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography. Twenty-two age-matched healthy subjects served as controls. Myocardial deformation was described by longitudinal and circumferential shortening (measured as strain and strain rate) and ventricular torsion, measured by speckle-tracking echocardiography. Although standard measurements of global systolic LV function were normal in patients with TGAs, longitudinal shortening was decreased compared with controls. Longitudinal strain was decreased in all ventricular regions except the posterior wall and most pronounced in the apical segments. LV circumferential shortening was similar in the 2 groups. Also, in the right ventricular free wall patients displayed decreased longitudinal shortening in the mid and apical segment. Moreover, LV torsion was decreased in the TGA group. Although rotation was relatively homogenous at the apical and basal levels in controls, there was greater dispersion in rotation in the patient group, with basal rotation being greatest in the inferior wall and apical rotation being greatest in the anterior wall. In conclusion, there was slightly decreased longitudinal shortening in the 2 ventricles and decreased LV torsion in patients with TGAs, although standard measurements of global ventricular function were normal.",Pettersen E; Fredriksen PM; Urheim S; Thaulow E; Smith HJ; Smevik B; Smiseth O; Andersen K,,2009,The American journal of cardiology,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,27630185,Microgravity as a biological tool to examine host-pathogen interactions and to guide development of therapeutics and preventatives that target pathogenic bacteria.,"Space exploration programs have long been interested in the effects of spaceflight on biology. This research is important not only in its relevance to future deep space exploration, but also because it has allowed investigators to ask questions about how gravity impacts cell behavior here on Earth. In the 1980s, scientists designed and built the first rotating wall vessel, capable of mimicking the low shear environment found in space. This vessel has since been used to investigate growth of both microorganisms and human tissue cells in low shear modeled microgravity conditions. Bacterial behavior has been shown to be altered both in space and under simulated microgravity conditions. In some cases, bacteria appear attenuated, whereas in others virulence is enhanced. This has consequences not only for manned spaceflight, but poses larger questions about the ability of bacteria to sense the world around them.

rotating_wall,17166827,Heterogeneous breast tumoroids: An in vitro assay for investigating cellular heterogeneity and drug delivery.,"Breast tumors are typically heterogeneous and contain diverse subpopulations of tumor cells with differing phenotypic properties. Planar cultures of cancer cell lines are not viable models of investigation of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions during tumor development. This article presents an in vitro coculture-based 3-dimensional heterogeneous breast tumor model that can be used in drug resistance and drug delivery investigations. Breast cancer cell lines of different phenotypes (MDAMB231, MCF7, and ZR751) were cocultured in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor to form a large number of heterogeneous tumoroids in a single cell culture experiment. Cells in the rotating vessels were labeled with Cell Tracker fluorescent probes to allow for time course fluorescence microscopy to monitor cell aggregation. Histological sections of tumoroids were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, progesterone receptor, E-cadherin (E-cad), and proliferation marker ki67. In vitro tumoroids developed in this study recapture important features of the temporal-spatial organization of solid tumors, including the presence of necrotic areas at the center and higher levels of cell division at the tumor periphery. E-cad-positive MCF7 cells form larger tumoroids than E-cad-negative MDAMB231 cells. In heterogeneous tumors, the irregular surface roughness was mainly due to the presence of MDAMB231 cells, whereas MCF7 cells formed smooth surfaces. Moreover, when heterogeneous tumoroids were placed onto collagen gels, highly invasive MDAMB231 cell-rich surface regions produced extensions into the matrix, whereas poorly invasive MCF7 cells did not. The fact that one can form a large number of 1-mm tumoroids in 1 coculture attests to the potential use of this system at high-throughput investigations of cancer drug development and drug delivery into the tumor.",Vamvakidou AP; Mondrinos MJ; Petushi SP; Garcia FU; Lelkes PI; Tozeren A,,2007,Journal of biomolecular screening,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,38254625,Structural and Molecular Changes of Human Chondrocytes Exposed to the Rotating Wall Vessel Bioreactor.,"Over the last 30 years, the prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA), a disease characterized by a loss of articular cartilage, has more than doubled worldwide. Patients suffer from pain and progressive loss of joint function. Cartilage is an avascular tissue mostly consisting of extracellular matrix with embedded chondrocytes. As such, it does not regenerate naturally, which makes an early onset of OA prevention and treatment a necessity to sustain the patients' quality of life. In recent years, tissue engineering strategies for the regeneration of cartilage lesions have gained more and more momentum. In this study, we aimed to investigate the scaffold-free 3D cartilage tissue formation under simulated microgravity in the NASA-developed rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. For this purpose, we cultured both primary human chondrocytes as well as cells from the immortalized line C28/I2 for up to 14 days on the RWV and analyzed tissue morphology, development of apoptosis, and expression of cartilage-specific proteins and genes by histological staining, TUNEL-assays, immunohistochemical detection of collagen species, and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. We observed spheroid formation in both cell types starting on day 3. After 14 days, constructs from C28/I2 cells had diameters of up to 5 mm, while primary chondrocyte spheroids were slightly smaller with 3 mm. Further inspection of the 14-day-old C28/I2 spheroids revealed a characteristic cartilage morphology with collagen-type 1, -type 2, and -type 10 positivity. Interestingly, these tissues were less susceptible to RWV-induced differential gene expression than those formed from primary chondrocytes, which showed significant changes in the regulation of IL6, ACTB, TUBB, VIM, COL1A1, COL10A1, MMP1, MMP3, MMP13, ITGB1, LAMA1, RUNX3, SOX9, and CASP3 gene expression. These diverging findings might reflect the differences between primary and immortalized cells. Taken together, this study shows that simulated microgravity using the RWV bioreactor is suitable to engineer dense 3D cartilage-like tissue without addition of scaffolds or any other artificial materials. Both primary articular cells and the stable chondrocyte cell line C28/I2 formed 3D neocartilage when exposed for 14 days to an RWV.",Steinwerth P; Bertrand J; Sandt V; Marchal S; Sahana J; Bollmann M; Schulz H; Kopp S; Grimm D; Wehland M,cartilage; extracellular matrix; gene expression; rotating wall vessel; scaffold-free; simulated microgravity; tissue engineering,2023,Biomolecules,Journal Article,50WK2270G/Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action/; 50WB2219/Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action/,
rotating_wall,11370802,A novel preclinical model of human malignant melanoma utilizing bioreactor rotating-wall vessels.,"Malignant melanoma poses a serious health risk which is becoming more crucial as the incidence of this disease steadily increases. The development of appropriate in vitro models that reflect the in vivo tumor environment is a key factor for the study of this malignancy. The local tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in the ability of tumor cells to proliferate and metastasize. While interactions among various cell types are known to be important for tumor growth, most in vitro models utilize only tumor cells, ignoring the importance of tumor-stroma interactions, as well as the contribution of immune cells, which may be important for potential therapies. In addition, the cellular architecture found in vivo, known to be involved in changes in gene expression, is not reflected in standard two-dimensional culture systems. In this study, we have utilized rotating-vessel bioreactors to culture minced human melanoma specimens, allowing the culture of three-dimensional structures which reflect the cellular architecture and heterogeneous composition of the tumor site in vivo. The viability of the pieces in culture can be maintained for 1-2 wk. Immunohistochemical analysis shows multiple cellular types similar to the in vivo situation. Therefore, this system provides a unique model of human melanoma that mimics the in vivo tumor environment much more closely than current culture methods. This novel system may be utilized to determine the mechanism of action of current therapy protocols, as well as to develop new treatment regimens.",Licato LL; Prieto VG; Grimm EA,,2001,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

rotating_wall,21720795,[Modern angiographic diagnostic techniques in the catheter laboratory].,"Even at the beginning of the twenty-first century angiography still is the gold standard for imaging coronary arteries. Many limitations of this technique have facilitated advancements, such as quantitative coronary angiography and 3-dimensional reconstruction. The use of intravascular ultrasound has enabled a transmural in vivo imaging of the coronary arteries while creating cross-sectional images of the vessel wall. This led to a better evaluation of vascular plaques and the surrounding structures of the vessel. Optical coherence tomography is a new modality based on infrared light, which provides intraluminal and extraluminal imaging of vessels with a resolution of 10-20 µm, which is better than intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). However even this modern diagnostic tool is limited in the assessment of the relevance of an epicardial stenosis. Evaluation of the fractional flow reserve is a pathophysiological test, which measures the pressure before and after an epicardial stenosis and is able to assess the functional condition of a vessel with a high sensitivity and specificity. The so-called C-arm computed tomography (CACT; DynaCT Cardiac; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) is a new application of an intraprocedural technique based on rotation of an x-ray source around a patient. It is able to generate information similar to that created by conventional computed tomography (CT) scans and offers the possibility to significantly enhance angiographic diagnostic modalities.",Rittger H; Sinha AM; Brachmann J,,2011,Herz,English Abstract; Journal Article; Review,,

To date, in vitro methods for producing tissues with highly ordered structure and high levels of function have met with limited success although a variety of 3D culture systems have been investigated. In this study, we reconstituted functional hepatic tissue including mature hepatocyte and blood vessel-like structures accompanied with bile duct-like structures from E15.5 fetal liver cells, which contained more hepatic stem/progenitor cells comparing with neonatal liver cells. The culture was performed in a simulated microgravity environment produced by a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. The hepatocytes in the reconstituted 3D tissue were found to be capable of producing albumin and storing glycogen. Additionally, bile canaliculi between hepatocytes, characteristics of adult hepatocyte in vivo were also formed. Apart from this, bile duct structure secreting mucin was shown to form complicated tubular branches. Furthermore, gene expression analysis by semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed the elevated levels of mature hepatocyte markers as well as genes with the hepatic function. With RWV culture system, we could produce functionally reconstituted liver tissue and this might be useful in pharmaceutical industry including drug screening and testing and other applications such as an alternative approach to experimental animals.

We have used a rotating wall bioreactor with a high aspect ratio vessel (HARV), which simulates the microgravity environment, to investigate the how the viability, neurite extension, and signaling of differentiated neuron-like cells changes in different culture environments. We show that culture of differentiated PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells in the simulated microgravity HARV bioreactor resulted in high cell viability, moderate neurite extension, and cell aggregation accompanied by NO production. Neurite extension was less than that seen in static cultures, suggesting that less than optimal differentiation occurs in simulated microgravity relative to normal gravity. Cells grown in a mixed vessel under normal gravity (a spinner flask) had low viability, low neurite extension, and high glutamate release. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using a rotating wall bioreactor to explore the effects of simulated microgravity on differentiation and physiology of neuron-like cells.",Wang SS; Good TA,,2001,Journal of cellular biochemistry,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,

Retrospective data imply a better outcome with stimulation of the latest contracting left ventricular (LV) region. Our study analysed the feasibility, safety and clinical outcome of prospectively planned LV lead placement at the site of latest mechanical activation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-eight heart failure patients with CRT indication were assessed by three-dimensional (3D) transoesophageal echocardiography and rotation angiography of the coronary sinus (CS). Both images were merged into a single 3D-model to identify CS target veins close to the site of latest mechanical activation. Subsequently, LV lead deployment was attempted at the desired target position. Patients were clinically and echocardiographically evaluated at baseline, after 3 and 6 months. The area of latest mechanical activation covered 6 ± 2 segments (38 ± 13% of LV surface) and was found lateral in 24 of 37 (65%), anterior in 11 of 37 (30%), inferior in 2 of 37 (5%), and septal in 1 of 37 (3%) patients. In 36 of 37 (97%) patients an appropriate target vein was identified and successful implantation could be performed in 34 of 37 (92%) patients. Among those patients clinical and echocardiographic response was observed in 91% and 81%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Individualized lead placement at the latest contracting LV site can be performed safely and successfully in the majority of patients. Initial clinical outcome data are encouraging. Identification of target sites requires multimodality integration between LV wall motion data and CS anatomy. Future developments need to improve those technologies and require randomized data on clinical outcome parameters.",Döring M; Braunschweig F; Eitel C; Gaspar T; Wetzel U; Nitsche B; Hindricks G; Piorkowski C,,2013,"Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal",Journal Article,,

For several decades, IVUS has made remarkable progress in improving the accuracy of diagnosing cardiovascular disease that remains the leading cause of death globally. As the quality of IVUS images mainly depends on the performance of the IVUS transducer, various IVUS transducers have been developed.

Strontium chloride is known to increase osteoblastogenesis and repress adipogenesis, but its effects in microgravity-related conditions have not been established. Our goal was to investigate early events in this process, focusing on RhoGTPases as controllers of cytoskeletal organization leading to stem cell commitment. We cultivated C3H10T1/2 on microspheres using a rotating wall vessel bioreactor (NASA) in order to simulate microgravity-related conditions in adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis conditions independently. We observed that rotating wall vessel cultures presented increased adipogenesis, while osteoblastogenesis was reduced. Strontium-treated multipotent cells presented a significant repression in adipogenesis (-90 %, p < 0.001 PPARyD8) and an activation of osteoblastogenesis (+95 %, p < 0.001 bone sialoprotein and osteopontin D8), even in gravity altered conditions. We established that concomitant RhoA/Rac1 activations were associated with osteoblastogenesis enhancement and adipogenesis limitation in uncommitted cells. As vascular endothelial growth factor splicing is mechanosensitive and its signaling is central to stem cell commitment, we investigated vascular endothelial growth factor production, isoforms and receptors expressions in our conditions. We observed that vascular endothelial growth factor and receptors expressions were not significantly affected, but we found that presence of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor was associated with RhoA/Rac1 activations, whereas sequestration of vascular endothelial growth factor by cells was associated with RhoA/Rac1 inhibitions. We propose that strontium triggers secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and the subsequent Rac1 and RhoA activations leading to repression of adipogenesis and osteogenesis stimulation validating strontium as a counter measure for microgravity-induced alteration of cell commitment.",Louis F; Bouleftour W; Rattner A; Linossier MT; Vico L; Guignandon A,,2017,NPJ microgravity,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,19439187,Sub-mitogenic phorbol myristate acetate co-stimulation rescues the PHA-induced activation of both naïve and memory T cells cultured in the rotating-wall vessel bioreactor.,"T lymphocytes are unresponsive to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation during culture in spaceflight or ground-based microgravity analogs such as the rotating-wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. The TCR-induced activation of a subset of T cells can be rescued in the RWV by co-stimulation with sub-mitogenic doses of phorbol ester (PMA). We report that PMA co-stimulation of primary human T cells cultured in the RWV rescues the phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced activation of the CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets as well as naïve and memory CD4+ T cells. Importantly, T cells activated in the RWV by PHA+PMA contained these subsets in proportions strikingly similar to control cultures activated with PHA alone. The data indicate that rescuing T cell activation with PMA co-stimulation does not significantly perturb the heterogeneity of the responding cells, and represent an important proof of principle for the design of immune-boosting agents for use in spaceflight.",Simons DM; Gardner EM; Lelkes PI,,2009,Cell biology international,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,20127722,Intact T cell receptor signaling by CD4(+) T cells cultured in the rotating wall-vessel bioreactor.,"T lymphocytes fail to proliferate or secrete cytokines in response to T cell receptor (TCR) agonists during culture in spaceflight or ground-based microgravity analogs such as rotating wall-vessel (RWV) bioreactors. In RWVs, these responses can be rescued by co-stimulation with sub-mitogenic doses of the diacyl glycerol (DAG) mimetic phorbol myristate acetate. Based on this result we hypothesized that TCR activation is abrogated in the RWV due to impaired DAG signaling downstream of the TCR. To test this hypothesis we compared TCR-induced signal transduction by primary, human, CD4(+) T cells in RWV, and static culture. Surprisingly, we found little evidence of impaired DAG signaling in the RWV. Upstream of DAG, the tyrosine phosphorylation of several key components of the TCR-proximal signal was not affected by culture in the RWV. Similarly, the phosphorylation and compartmentalization of ERK and the degradation of IkappaB were unchanged by culture in the RWV indicating that RAS- and PKC-mediated signaling downstream of DAG are also unaffected by simulated microgravity. We conclude from these data that TCR signaling through DAG remains intact during culture in the RWV, and that the loss of functional T cell activation in this venue derives from the affect of simulated microgravity on cellular processes that are independent of the canonical TCR pathway.",Simons DM; Gardner EM; Lelkes PI,,2010,Journal of cellular biochemistry,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,

METHODS: During a routine ophthalmologic examination, in a 26-year-old man with a visual acuity of 0.80 and a refractive error of -10.25 D, a dehiscence in the parapapillary region was detected. A choroidal vessel appeared to emerge out of the dehiscence RESULTS: : Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed an apparent hole in the underlying scleral wall opening into a retrobulbar empty space. The latter was delimited by the dura mater as shown by a vertical bright band. Inside of the dura mater, the retrobulbar orbital cerebrospinal fluid space was widened. Interestingly, the same eye showed a parapapillary intrachoroidal cavitation almost completely hiding the main temporal inferior vessel branch. In addition, the optic disc was vertically rotated and slightly obliquely tilted so that its en face appearance was smaller than its surface as it appeared on the OCT image. CONCLUSIONS: The OCT revealed a parapapillary gamma zone hole in a highly myopic eye in association with a vertically rotated and slightly tilted optic disc with an inferior parapapillary intrachoroidal cavitation.

However, it is difficult to analyze the stress force on vessel walls using experiments directly. Using computational fluid dynamics is a better way to study the stress force characteristics of the burr grinding procedure from a fluid dynamics perspective. For this purpose, physical and simulation models of atherosclerotic plaque removal were constructed in this study. The simulation results show that smaller ratios between the burr and arterial diameter (B/A = 0.5) result in a more stable flow field domain. Additionally, the pressure and stress force generated by the 4.5 mm diameter grinding tool reach 92.77 kPa and 10.36 kPa, surpassing those of the 2.5 mm and 3.5 mm grinding tools.

Articular chondrocytes isolated from 10 aged patients (median age, 84 years) were increased in monolayer culture. A single-cell suspension of dedifferentiated chondrocytes was inoculated in a rotating wall vessel, without the use of any scaffold or supporting gel material. After 90 days of cultivation, a three-dimensional cartilage-like tissue was formed, encapsulated by fibrous tissue resembling a perichondrial membrane. Morphological examination revealed differentiated chondrocytes ordered in clusters within a continuous dense cartilaginous matrix demonstrating a strong positive staining with monoclonal antibodies against collagen type II and articular proteoglycan. The surrounding fibrous membrane consisted of fibroblast-like cells, and showed a clear distinction from the cartilaginous areas when stained against collagen type I. Transmission electron microscopy revealed differentiated and highly metabolically active chondrocytes, producing an extracellular matrix consisting of a fine network of randomly distributed cross-banded collagen fibrils.

We now report that LAM-1 is also a major mediator of leukocyte attachment to activated human endothelium. In a novel adhesion assay, LAM-1 was shown to mediate approximately 50% of the adhesion of both lymphocytes and neutrophils to TNF-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells at 4 degrees C. The contribution of LAM-1 to leukocyte adhesion was only detectable when the assays were carried out under rotating (nonstatic) conditions, suggesting that LAM-1 is involved in the initial attachment of leukocytes to endothelium. In this assay at 37 degrees C, essentially all lymphocyte attachment to endothelium was mediated by LAM-1, VLA-4/VCAM-1, and the CD11/CD18 complex, whereas neutrophil attachment was mediated by LAM-1, endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, and CD11/CD18. Thus, multiple receptors are necessary to promote optimal leukocyte adhesion to endothelium. LAM-1 also appeared to be involved in optimal neutrophil transendothelial migration using a videomicroscopic in vitro transmigration model system. LAM-1-dependent leukocyte adhesion required the induction and surface expression of a neuraminidase-sensitive molecule that was expressed for at least 24 h on activated endothelium. Expression of the LAM-1 ligand by endothelium was optimally induced by LPS and the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, whereas IFN-gamma and IL-4 induced lower levels of expression. The LAM-1 ligand on HEV and cytokine treated endothelium may be similar carbohydrate-containing molecules, because phosphomannan monoester core complex from yeast Hansenula hostii cell wall blocked binding of lymphocytes to both cell types, and identical epitopes on LAM-1-mediated lymphocyte attachment to HEV and activated endothelium. Thus, LAM-1 and its inducible endothelial ligand constitute a new pair of adhesion molecules that may regulate initial leukocyte/endothelial interactions at sites of inflammation.",Spertini O; Luscinskas FW; Kansas GS; Munro JM; Griffin JD; Gimbrone MA Jr; Tedder TF,,1991,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)","Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",AI-26872/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; CA-34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; CA-36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; etc.,

BACKGROUND: Rotational atherectomy is currently the preferred treatment for heavily calcified coronary lesions. However, the mechanism of lumen enlargement in noncalcified lesions has not been studied in detail. Intravascular ultrasound allows detailed, cross-sectional imaging of the coronary arteries in vivo. The normal coronary artery wall, the major components of the atherosclerotic plaque and the quantitative changes in vessel, lumen and plaque cross-sectional areas and volumes that occur as a result of the atherosclerotic disease process and during transcatheter therapy can be studied in a manner otherwise not possible. METHODS: Eighteen noncalcified native vessel lesions in 18 patients were imaged before and after rotational atherectomy using intravascular ultrasound systems incorporating motorized transducer pullback through a stationary imaging sheath. External elastic membrane, lumen and plaque plus media cross-sectional areas were measured every 1 mm of lesion length (for a total of 10 image slices), and external elastic membrane, lumen and plaque plus media volumes were calculated using Simpson's rule. RESULTS: After rotational atherectomy, the minimal lumen cross-sectional area increased from 1.37 +/- 0.50 to 2.99 +/- 0.60 mm2 (mean value +/- 1 SD, p < 0.0001).

rotating_wall,6332158,[Detectability of stress-induced ischemic lesion in previous myocardial infarction using 201T1 myocardial single photon emission computed tomography].,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the detectability of stress-induced ischemic lesion in patients with previous myocardial infarction using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) producing thallium-201 (T1-201) myocardial perfusion imagings (MPI). Seventy patients underwent stress SPECT by symptom-limited graded bicycle ergometer exercise using a dual-headed rotating gamma camera (Toshiba GCA70A) equipped with a computer system (GMS90). After intravenous administration of 2.5 mCi of T1-201, stress SPECT data at 10 minutes and delayed SPECT data at 3 hours after the injection were collected in the 64 X 64 matrix form covering 360 degrees directions by camera sweep of 180 degrees in 6 minutes, which were immediately followed by conventional planar imagings (PL). Transaxial tomographic image reconstruction was performed by convolution method using a Shepp-Logan's filter. Thereafter, sagittal and coronal tomographic images were reconstructed for about 2 minutes. Image interpretation was assessed visually. The results were as follows: Sensitivity and specificity in detecting the affected vessel with more than 75% stenosis by segmental analysis of myocardial images were higher by SPECT than by PL (LAD 89% and 65%, LCX 68% and 56%, RCA 89% and 76% in sensitivity and LAD 94% and LCX 75%, 92% and 94%, RCA 81% and 59% in specificity, respectively). Sensitivity in detecting both single (82%) and multivessel disease (76%) was fairly high. Detectability of stress-induced ischemia (i.e. occurrence of a new defect in patients with previous myocardial infarction and ST-segment depression in ECG) was significantly higher in SPECT (67%) than in PL (39%, p less than 0.005) and in ECG (39%, p less than 0.005). A perfusion defect in the extensive anterior wall, marked left ventricular dilatation and the widening of the angle toward the apex composed of septal and anterolateral walls in transaxial images were the findings characteristic of anterior myocardial infarction with severe dyskinesis. We conclude that stress SPECT is a useful noninvasive technique for the documentation of the number of vessels affected and severe wall motion abnormality of the LV and for the detection of stress-induced ischemia in previous myocardial infarction.",Futagami Y; Hamada M; Ichikawa T; Yamakado T; Konishi T; Nakano T; Takezawa H; Takeda K; Maeda H,,1983,Journal of cardiography,Journal Article,,

Although the original tumor was comprised of both epithelial and mesodermal components, long-term culture in conventional flasks established a cell line from this tumor with homogeneous epitheliallike growth characteristics (1). Cells from Passage 36 were seeded into a Rotating-Wall Vessel containing Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads. Scanning electron micrographs of tumor cells cultured for 32 d in the RWV showed the presence of heterogeneous cell populations organized into three-dimensional tissuelike architecture. Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed the cellular heterogeneity, as demonstrated by expression of both epithelial and mesenchymal antigens. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification demonstrated the presence of mRNA for cellular oncogenes HER-2/neu, H-ras, K-ras, and tumor suppressor p53. Thus, there are two advantages to propagation of tissue in the RWV culture system:(a) tissue diversification representing populations present in the original tumor, and (b) the three-dimensional freedom to organize tissues morphologically akin to those observed in vivo. These data indicate that the RWV culture system is suitable for generating large quantities of ovarian tumor cells in vitro that are amenable to immunocytochemical, oncogenic, morphologic characteristics demonstrated in vivo.",Goodwin TJ; Prewett TL; Spaulding GF; Becker JL,,1997,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

A lack of physiologically-relevant animal models for many viruses has limited the elucidation of factors that influence viral pathogenesis and of complex host immune mechanisms. Conventional monolayer cell cultures may support viral infection, but are unable to form the tissue structures and complex microenvironments that mimic host physiology and, therefore, limiting their translational utility. The rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor was designed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to model microgravity and was later found to more accurately reproduce features of human tissue in vivo. Cells grown in RWV bioreactors develop in a low fluid-shear environment, which enables cells to form complex 3D tissue-like aggregates. A wide variety of human tissues (from neuronal to vaginal tissue) have been grown in RWV bioreactors and have been shown to support productive viral infection and physiological meaningful host responses. The in vivo-like characteristics and cellular features of the human 3D RWV-derived aggregates make them ideal model systems to effectively recapitulate pathophysiology and host responses necessary to conduct rigorous basic science, preclinical and translational studies.",Gardner JK; Herbst-Kralovetz MM,bioreactor; emerging viruses; host immune mechanisms; human tissue engineering; in vitro cell culture; infectious disease; low fluid-shear; organotypic; pathophysiology; viral pathogenesis,2016,Viruses,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Review",R15 AI113457/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States,

To study these host-microbe interactions in vitro, we developed a human three-dimensional (3-D) endometrial epithelial cell (EEC) model using the HEC-1A cell line and the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology. Our model, composed of 3-D EEC aggregates, recapitulates several functional/structural characteristics of human endometrial epithelial tissue, including cell differentiation, the presence of junctional complexes/desmosomes and microvilli, and the production of membrane-associated mucins and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLR function was evaluated by exposing the EEC aggregates to viral and bacterial products. Treatment with poly(I·C) and flagellin but not with synthetic lipoprotein (fibroblast-stimulating lipoprotein 1 [FSL-1]) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly induced proinflammatory mediators in a dose-dependent manner. To simulate ascending infection, we infected EEC aggregates with commensal and pathogenic bacteria: Lactobacillus crispatus, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae All vaginal microbiota and N. gonorrhoeae efficiently colonized the 3-D surface, localizing to crevices of the EEC model and interacting with multiple adjacent cells simultaneously. However, only infection with pathogenic N. gonorrhoeae and not infection with the other bacteria tested significantly induced proinflammatory mediators and significant ultrastructural changes to the host cells. The latter observation is consistent with clinical findings and illustrated the functional specificity of our system. Additionally, we highlighted the utility of the 3-D EEC model for the study of the pathogenesis of N. gonorrhoeae using a well-characterized ΔpilT mutant. Overall, this study demonstrates that the human 3-D EEC model is a robust tool for studying host-microbe interactions and bacterial pathogenesis in the upper FRT.",Łaniewski P; Gomez A; Hire G; So M; Herbst-Kralovetz MM,Gardnerella vaginalis; Lactobacillus; Neisseria gonorrhoeae; Toll-like receptor; female reproductive tract; innate immunity; membrane-associated mucin; organotypic model; rotating wall vessel bioreactor; uterine,2017,Infection and immunity,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,37633341,The development and characterization of in vivo-like three-dimensional models of bronchial epithelial cell lines.,"In vitro models of differentiated respiratory epithelium that allow high-throughput screening are an important tool to explore new therapeutics for chronic respiratory diseases. In the present study, we developed in vivo-like three-dimensional (3-D) models of bronchial epithelial cell lines that are commonly used to study chronic lung disease (16HBE14o(-), CFBE41o(-) and CFBE41o(-) 6.2 WT-CFTR). To this end, cells were cultured on porous microcarrier beads in the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, an optimized suspension culture method that allows higher throughput experimentation than other physiologically relevant models. Cell differentiation was compared to conventional two-dimensional (2-D) monolayer cultures and to the current gold standard in the respiratory field, i.e. air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures. Cellular differentiation was assessed in the three model systems by evaluating the expression and localization of markers that reflect the formation of tight junctions (zonula occludens 1), cell polarity (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 at the apical side and collagen IV expression at the basal cell side), multicellular complexity (acetylated α-tubulin for ciliated cells, CC10 for club cells, keratin-5 for basal cells) and mucus production (MUC5AC) through immunostaining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results were validated using Western Blot analysis. We found that tight junctions were expressed in 2-D monolayers, ALI cultures and 3-D models for all three cell lines. All tested bronchial epithelial cell lines showed polarization in ALI and 3-D cultures, but not in 2-D monolayers. Mucus secreting goblet-like cells were present in ALI and 3-D cultures of CFBE41o(-) and CFBE41o(-) 6.2 WT-CFTR cells, but not in 16HBE14o(-) cells. For all cell lines, there were no ciliated cells, basal cells, or club cells found in any of the model systems. In conclusion, we developed RWV-derived 3-D models of commonly used bronchial epithelial cell lines and showed that these models are a valuable alternative to ALI cultures, as they recapitulate similar key aspects of the in vivo parental tissue.",Van den Bossche S; Ostyn L; Vandendriessche V; Rigauts C; De Keersmaecker H; Nickerson CA; Crabbé A,Bronchial epithelial cells; Cystic fibrosis; Differentiation; Organotypic; Rotating wall vessel bioreactor; Three-dimensional cell culture models,2023,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,28497431,"Effect of catheter-based renal denervation on left ventricular function, mass and (un)twist with two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography.","BACKGROUND: Speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) is an echocardiography modality that is able to measure left ventricular (LV) characteristics, including rotation, strain and strain rate. Strain measures myocardial fibre contraction and relaxation. This study aims to assess the effect of renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) on functional myocardial parameters, including STE, and to identify potential differences between responders and non-responders. METHODS: The study population consisted of 31 consecutive patients undergoing RDN in the context of treatment for resistant hypertension. Patients were included between December 2012 and June 2014. Transthoracic echocardiography and speckle tracking analysis was performed at baseline and at 6 months follow-up. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 31 patients with treatment-resistant hypertension treated with RDN (mean age 64 ± 10 years, 15 men). The total study population could be divided into responders (n = 19) and non-responders (n = 12) following RDN. RDN reduced office blood pressure by 18.9 ± 26.8/8.5 ± 13.5 mmHg (p < 0.001). A significant decrease was seen in LV posterior wall thickness (LVPWd) (0.47 ± 1.0 mm; p = 0.020), without a significant change in the LV mass index (LVMI). In the total cohort, only peak late diastolic filling velocity (A-wave velocity) decreased significantly by 5.3 ± 13.2 cm/s (p = 0.044) and peak untwisting velocity decreased significantly by 14.5 ± 28.9°/s (p = 0.025).

rotating_wall,18606368,The application of low shear modeled microgravity to 3-D cell biology and tissue engineering.,"The practice of cell culture has been virtually unchanged for 100 years. Until recently, life scientists have had to content themselves with two-dimensional cell culture technology. Clearly, living creatures are not constructed in two dimensions and thus it has become widely recognized that in vitro culture systems must become three dimensional to correctly model in vivo biology. Attempts to modify conventional 2-D culture technology to accommodate 3-D cell growth such as embedding cells in extracellular matrix have demonstrated the superiority of concept. Nevertheless, there are serious drawbacks to this approach including limited mass transport and lack of scalability. Recently, a new cell culture technology developed at NASA to study the effects of microgravity on cells has emerged to solve many of the problems of 3-D cell culture. The technology, the Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) is a single axis clinostat consisting of a fluid-filled, cylindrical, horizontally rotating culture vessel. Cells placed in this environment are suspended by the resolution of the gravitational, centrifugal and Coriolis forces with extremely low mechanical shear. These conditions, which have been called ""low shear modeled microgravity"", enable cells to assemble into tissue-like aggregates with high mass transport of nutrients, oxygen and wastes. Examples of the use of the RWV for basic cell biology research and tissue engineering applications are discussed.",Navran S,,2008,Biotechnology annual review,Journal Article; Review,,

The effect of gravity on living organisms can be investigated by controlling the magnitude of gravity. Most reduced gravity experiments are conducted on the Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) in the International Space Station (ISS). However, running experiments in ISS face challenges such as high cost, extreme condition, lack of direct accessibility, and long waiting period. Therefore, researchers have developed various ground-based devices and methods to perform reduced gravity experiments. However, the advantage of space conditions for developing new drugs, vaccines, and chemical applications requires more attention and new research. Advancements in conventional methods and the development of new methods are necessary to fulfil these demands.

rotating_wall,37832521,Exploring the free-energy landscape of a rotating superfluid.,"The equilibrium state of a superfluid in a rotating cylindrical vessel is a vortex crystal-an array of vortex lines, which is stationary in the rotating frame. Experimental realizations of this behavior typically show a sequence of transient states before the free-energy-minimizing configuration is reached. Motivated by these observations, we construct a new method for a systematic exploration of the free-energy landscape via gradient-based optimization of a scalar loss function. Our approach is inspired by the pioneering numerical work of Campbell and Ziff [Phys. Rev. B. 20, 1886 (1979)] and makes use of automatic differentiation, which crucially allows us to include entire solution trajectories in the loss. We first use the method to converge thousands of low free-energy relative equilibria in the unbounded domain for vortex numbers in the range 10≤N≤30, which reveals an extremely dense set of mostly saddle-like solutions. As part of this search, we discover new continuous families of relative equilibria, which are often global minimizers of free energy. These continuous families all consist of crystals arranged in a double-ring configuration, and we assess which state from the family is most likely to be observed experimentally by computing energy-minimizing pathways from nearby local minima-identifying a common entry point into the family. The continuous families become discrete sets of equal-energy solutions when the wall is introduced in the problem. Finally, we develop an approach to compute homoclinic orbits and use it to examine the dynamics in the vicinity of the minimizing state by converging connections for low-energy saddles. under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).",Cleary A; Page J,,2023,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",Journal Article,,

Seventy eight per cent of the patients were male. Mean age was 61.1 +/- 9.6 yrs and mean ejection fraction was 0.59 +/- 0.18. The indications for PTCA were chronic stable angina (53%), post myocardial infarction (MI) angina (26.6%), unstable angina (17.4%) and acute MI (3%). Emergency PTCA was performed on 15 cases with 5 patients in cardiogenic shock. Fifty four per cent of the cases were performed in single vessel disease, 33 per cent in double vessel disease and 13 per cent in tripple vessel disease. The vessels dilated were the left anterior descending artery (44.2%), right coronary artery (27.8%), left circumflex artery (26.7%), left main (0.9%) and saphenous vein graft (0.4%). Mean balloon size was 2.48 mm. The overall success rate of PTCA, defined as residual diameter stenosis less than 50 per cent, was 91.5 per cent. In addition to PTCA, 123 stent implantations with mean stent size 2.98 mm and 15 rotational athrectomy were done in 114 cases. Complications of PTCA occurred in 32 cases (6.9%). Ten patients (2.2%) had abrupt closure, 1 of these needed emergency coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG). One patient (0.2%) had cerebral embolism with minor residual neurological deficit. One patient (0.2%) had toe gangrene which eventually needed amputation. One patient (0.2%) who presented with acute extensive anterior wall MI and failure of thrombolytic therapy died 8 hours after successful PTCA due to refractory cardiogenic shock. In the patients who also had stent implantation, there were 6 stent misplacements: 3 in the right femoral artery without any complication, 2 were misplacements in the coronary system and 1 dislodged in LM necessitating emergency CABG.

To develop an in vitro model for studying these various aspects of HIV pathogenesis we have utilized blocks of surgically excised human tonsils and a rotating wall vessel (RWV) cell culture system. Here we show that (1) fragments of the surgically excised human lymphoid tissue remain viable and retain their gross cytoarchitecture for at least 3 weeks when cultured in the RWV system; (2) such lymphoid tissue gradually shows a loss of both T and B cells to the surrounding growth medium; however, this cellular migration is reversible as demonstrated by repopulation of the tissue by labeled cells from the growth medium; (3) this cellular migration may be partially or completely inhibited by embedding the blocks of lymphoid tissue in either a collagen or agarose gel matrix; these embedded tissue blocks retain most of the basic elements of a normal lymphoid cytoarchitecture; and (4) both embedded and nonembedded RWV-cultured blocks of human lymphoid tissue are capable of productive infection by HIV-1 of at least three various strains of different tropism and phenotype, as shown by an increase in both p24 antigen levels and free virus in the culture medium, and by the demonstration of HIV-1 RNA-positive cells inside the tissue identified by in situ hybridization. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that gel-embedded and nonembedded blocks of human lymphoid tissue, cocultured with a suspension of tonsillar lymphocytes in an RWV culture system, constitute a useful model for simulating normal lymphocyte recirculatory traffic and provide a new tool for testing the various aspects of HIV pathogenesis.",Margolis LB; Fitzgerald W; Glushakova S; Hatfill S; Amichay N; Baibakov B; Zimmerberg J,,1997,AIDS research and human retroviruses,Journal Article,,

In static cultures, organoid development may be hindered by limitations in diffusion of oxygen and nutrients. Herein, we report a bioprocess using rotating-wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors to culture retinal organoids derived from mouse pluripotent stem cells. Organoids in RWV demonstrate enhanced proliferation, with well-defined morphology and improved differentiation of neurons including ganglion cells and S-cone photoreceptors. Furthermore, RWV organoids at day 25 (D25) reveal similar maturation and transcriptome profile as those at D32 in static culture, closely recapitulating spatiotemporal development of postnatal day 6 mouse retina in vivo. Interestingly, however, retinal organoids do not differentiate further under any in vitro condition tested here, suggesting additional requirements for functional maturation.

rotating_wall,18430020,Use of the rotating wall vessel technology to study the effect of shear stress on growth behaviour of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01.,"The biofilm phenotype of Pseudomonas aeruginosa enables this opportunistic pathogen to develop resistance to the immune system and antimicrobial agents. Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms are generated under varying levels of shear stress, depending on the infection site. In the lung mucus of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, P. aeruginosa forms matrix-enclosed microcolonies which cause chronic infections representing the major cause of mortality in CF patients. The lung mucus of CF patients is probably characterized by low fluid shear as the main shear-causing factor, i.e. mucociliary clearance, is absent. In this study, the influence of fluid shear on the growth behaviour of P. aeruginosa PA01 was investigated using a low-shear suspension culture device, the rotating wall vessel (RWV). Cultivation in low shear induced a self-aggregating phenotype of P. aeruginosa PA01, resulting in the formation of biofilms in suspension similar to what has been described in CF mucus. The addition of a ceramic bead to the culture medium in the RWV created a higher-shear condition which led to the formation of surface-attached rather than suspension biofilms. In low-shear culture conditions, a significant increase of the rhl N-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C(4)-HSL) directed quorum sensing (QS) system, and the psl polysaccharide synthetic locus was demonstrated using gene expression analysis. Accordingly, the low-shear condition induced a higher production of rhamnolipids, which is controlled by the C(4)-HSL QS-system and is known to play a role in CF lung pathology. These results indicate that fluid shear has an impact on the growth phenotype of P. aeruginosa which might play a role in CF lung infections caused by this bacterium.",Crabbé A; De Boever P; Van Houdt R; Moors H; Mergeay M; Cornelis P,,2008,Environmental microbiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,17243119,Identification of mechanosensitive genes in osteoblasts by comparative microarray studies using the rotating wall vessel and the random positioning machine.,"Weightlessness or microgravity of spaceflight induces bone loss due in part to decreased bone formation by unknown mechanisms. Due to difficulty in performing experiments in space, several ground-based simulators such as the Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) and Random Positioning Machine (RPM) have become critical venues to continue studying space biology. However, these simulators have not been systematically compared to each other or to mechanical stimulating models. Here, we hypothesized that exposure to RWV inhibits differentiation and alters gene expression profiles of 2T3 cells, and a subset of these mechanosensitive genes behaves in a manner consistent to the RPM and opposite to the trends incurred by mechanical stimulation of mouse tibiae. Exposure of 2T3 preosteoblast cells to the RWV for 3 days inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of differentiation, and downregulated 61 and upregulated 45 genes by more than twofold compared to static 1 g controls, as shown by microarray analysis. The microarray results were confirmed by real-time PCR and/or Western blots for seven separate genes and proteins including osteomodulin, runx2, and osteoglycin. Comparison of the RWV data to the RPM microarray study that we previously published showed 14 mechanosensitive genes that changed in the same direction. Further comparison of the RWV and RPM results to microarray data from mechanically loaded mouse tibiae reported by an independent group revealed that three genes including osteoglycin were upregulated by the loading and downregulated by our simulators. These mechanosensitive genes may provide novel insights into understanding the mechanisms regulating bone formation and potential targets for countermeasures against decreased bone formation during space flight and in pathologies associated with lack of bone formation.",Patel MJ; Liu W; Sykes MC; Ward NE; Risin SA; Risin D; Jo H,,2007,Journal of cellular biochemistry,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",HL075209/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; HL71014/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,

The calibration models were based on off-line spectra from tissue culture experiments described previously (Rhiel et al., Biotechnol Bioeng 77:73-82). Monitoring performance was improved by Fourier filtering of the spectra and initial off-set adjustment. The resulting standard errors of predictions were 0.95, 0.74, and 0.39 mM for glucose, lactate, and glutamine, respectively. The concentration of ammonia could not be accurately measured from the same spectra. In addition, metabolite uptake and production rates were determined for PC-3 prostate cancer cells during exponential growth in batch-mode cultivation. Cells grew with a doubling time of 21 h and consumed glucose and glutamine at rates of 6.8 and 1.8 x 10(-17) mol/cell.s, respectively. This resulted in lactate and ammonia production rates of 11.9 and 1.3 x 10(-17) mol/cell.s, respectively. Compared with other monitoring technologies, this technology has many advantages for spaceflights and stand-alone units; for instance, calibration can be performed at one time and then applied in a reagentless, low-maintenance way at a later time. The resulting concentration information can be incorporated into closed-loop control schemes, thereby leading to better in vitro models of in vivo behavior.",Rhiel MH; Cohen MB; Arnold MA; Murhammer DW,,2004,Biotechnology and bioengineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,

We attempted to assess left-ventricular (LV) function, aortic (Ao) function, and right-ventricular (RV) function in athletes with different forms of training by using three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and speckle-tracking imaging (STI). METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined 35 male marathon runners (endurance-trained athletes, ETA), 35 powerlifting athletes (strength-trained athletes, STA), 35 martial arts athletes (mixed-trained athletes, MTA), and 35 sedentary untrained healthy men (controls, CTR). Two-dimensional and three-dimensional echocardiography were performed for the assessment of LV and RV systolic/diastolic function. LV and RV longitudinal strain (LS) and LV torsion (LVtor) were determined using STI (EchoPAC BT11, GE-Ultrasound). Maximum velocity of systolic wall expansion peaks (AoSvel) was determined using TDI. ETA experienced LV eccentric hypertrophy with increased 3D LV end-diastolic volume and mass and significant increase in peak systolic apical rotation and LVtor. In all groups of athletes, RV-LS was reduced at rest and improved after exercise. AoSvel was significantly increased in ETA and MTA and significantly decreased in STA compared with CTR. There were good correlations between LV remodelling and aortic stiffness values. Multivariate analysis showed aortic wall velocities to be independently related to LV mass index. CONCLUSION: In strength-trained, endurance-trained, and mixed-trained athletes, ventricular and vascular response assessed by 3DE, TDI, and STI underlies different adaptations of LV, RV, and aortic indexes.",Vitarelli A; Capotosto L; Placanica G; Caranci F; Pergolini M; Zardo F; Martino F; De Chiara S; Vitarelli M,Aortic function; Athlete's heart; Echocardiography; Speckle tracking imaging; Three-dimensional echocardiography; Tissue Doppler imaging; Ventricular function,2013,European heart journal.

Individual and interactive effects of model system parameters on construct structure, function, and molecular properties were evaluated. The results showed that these adult human MSCs even at old age not only expressed primitive mesenchymal cell markers but also maintained a high level of colony-forming efficiency and were capable of differentiating into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes upon appropriate inductions. After 21 days of culture, we found that the osteoblastic and chondrocytic lineage gene expression were earlier and higher expressed in spinner flask bioreactor culture group when compared with the static culture and rotating wall vessel reactor culture. The osteogenic lineage proteins type I collagen, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin were strongly stained in histological sections of spinner flask bioreactor culture, whereas these were less detected in the other two groups, especially in rotating wall vessel reactor culture. As for the markers associated with the chondrogenic lineage differentiation proteins, type II collagen was apparently expressed in spinner flask culture group, while the expression of proteoglycans (aggreacan, decorin) in three culture conditions took the lead of each other. We conclude that the spinner flask bioreactor with appropriate induction medium reported in this study may be used to rapidly expand adult MSCs and is likely to possess better induction results toward osteoblastic and chondrocytic lineages.",Wang TW; Wu HC; Wang HY; Lin FH; Sun JS,,2009,Journal of biomedical materials research.

rotating_wall,17969035,Three-dimensional fabrication of engineered bone with human bio-derived bone scaffolds in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor.,"Bone tissue engineering has emerged as a promising strategy in the effort to regenerate and repair diseased or damaged bone. The bioreactor, within which engineered bone tissue is cultured, plays a key role in the development of engineered bone graphs. In this work, the potentials of the rotating wall vessel bioreactor (RWVB) and the human bio-derived bone scaffolds (BDBS) for 3D bone culture are evaluated. The osteoblasts isolated from the cranium of neonatal Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat of 3 days old were expanded firstly with microcarrier suspension culture in a RWVB. After the assessment of the biological functions of the expanded cells by histomorphometry, the cells were seeded at 2 x 10(6) and 1 x 10(6) cells/mL, respectively, onto the 3D human BDBS and cultured for 3 weeks in the RWVB. The cells metabolism and nutrient concentration were monitored in the whole culture processes. The structure of the harvested bone tissues was observed with optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The biological properties of the engineered bone were detected by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) expression and alizarin red staining to visualize the newly formed bone. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) double fluorescence staining was used to analyze the cell activity. For a comparative study, cell seeded constructs were also cultured in static conditions. The results indicate that the bone grafts cultured in RWVB with two different seeded cell densities grew well, and the cell number expanded in RWVB was five times as that in T-flask and spinner flask. There were significantly more collagen fibers mineralized nodules and new osteoid tissue formed than those in T-flask and spinner flask. It also demonstrated that with the stress stimulation inside the fluid in the RWVB, the ALP expression could be increased; the formation of mineralized nodules can be accelerated.",Song K; Liu T; Cui Z; Li X; Ma X,,2008,Journal of biomedical materials research.

rotating_wall,30391796,A new hypothesis on the role of vessel topology in cerebral aneurysm initiation.,"Aneurysm pathogenesis is thought to be strongly linked with hemodynamical effects. According to our current knowledge, the formation process is initiated by locally disturbed flow conditions. The aim of the current work is to provide a numerical investigation on the role of the flow field at the stage of the initiation, before the aneurysm formation. Digitally reconstructed pre-aneurysmal geometries are used to examine correlations of the flow patterns to the location and direction of the aneurysms formed later. We argue that a very specific rotational flow pattern is present in all the investigated cases marking the location of the later aneurysm and that these flow patterns provide the mechanical load on the wall that can lead to a destructive remodelling in the vessel wall. Furthermore, these patterns induce elevated vessel surface related variables (e.g. wall shear stress (WSS), wall shear stress gradient (WSSG) and oscillatory shear index (OSI)), in agreement with the previous findings. We emphasise that the analysis of the flow patterns provides a deeper insight and a more robust numerical methodology compared to the sole examination of the aforementioned surface quantities.",Csippa B; Závodszky G; Paál G; Szikora I,Aneurysm initiation; CFD; Endothelial layer; Pathogenesis; Reconstruction; Secondary flow; WSS,2018,Computers in biology and medicine,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

We systematically analyzed a range of Gram negative Enterobacteriaceae for conservation of the low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) response using phenotypic assays, qPCR, and targeted mutations. Our results indicate LSMMG response conservation across Enterobacteriacae with potential variance in up- or down-regulation of a given response depending on genus. Based on the data, we analyzed the role of the trp operon genes and the TrpR regulator in the LSMMG response using targeted mutations in these genes in S. Typhimurium and E. coli. We found no alteration of the LSMMG response compared to WT in these mutant strains under the conditions tested here. To our knowledge, this study is first-of-kind for Citrobacter, Enterobacter, and Serratia, presents novel data for Escherichia, and provides the first analysis of trp genes in LSMMG responses. This impacts our understanding of how LSMMG affects bacteria and our ability to modify bacteria with this condition in the future.",Soni A; O'Sullivan L; Quick LN; Ott CM; Nickerson CA; Wilson JW,Enterobacteriaceae; Salmonella Typhimurium.; environmental response; low shear modeled microgravity; rotating wall vessel,2014,The open microbiology journal,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,20832004,Diameter-reducing wire to facilitate deployment of a modified Zenith fenestrated stent graft.,"BACKGROUND: Modified fenestrated stent grafts have been used for compassionate treatment of large complex aortic aneurysms in high-risk patients who do not have access to a manufactured device and are not candidates for conventional open surgical repair. Accurate device design and precise implantation are key components of the procedure. A technique of device modification with diameter-reducing wire is described to facilitate catheterization of side branches. METHODS: The modified Cook Zenith stent graft was created using reinforced fenestrations with gold nitinol markers. The stainless steel wire, which secures the top cap into the uncovered stent, was partially withdrawn, retrieved, and redirected externally through-and-through the fabric of the stent graft. Each Z-stent was constrained using the stainless steel wire for support and by two nonlocking prolene loops. The constrained stent graft was 30% narrower than the unconstrained device, which allowed flow between the stent graft and the aortic wall, as well as longitudinal and rotational movement of the stent graft. After successful catheterization of the fenestrations, balloon-expandable stent grafts were advanced over hydrophilic sheaths, and the stainless steel diameter-reducing wire was removed with full expansion of the Z-stents to its unconstrained diameter. The fenestrations were stented with balloon-expandable stent grafts, followed by placement of iliac limbs CONCLUSION: The use of a diameter-reducing wire allows longitudinal and rotational movement to the modified fenestrated stent graft and facilitates side branch catherization in patients in whom there is misalignment between the fenestration and the origin of the target vessel. rights reserved.",Oderich GS,,2010,Annals of vascular surgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,38384795,Magnetic resonance elastography resolving all gross anatomical segments of the kidney during controlled hydration.,"Introduction: Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a non-invasive method to quantify biomechanical properties of human tissues. It has potential in diagnosis and monitoring of kidney disease, if established in clinical practice. The interplay of flow and volume changes in renal vessels, tubule, urinary collection system and interstitium is complex, but physiological ranges of in vivo viscoelastic properties during fasting and hydration have never been investigated in all gross anatomical segments simultaneously. Method: Ten healthy volunteers underwent two imaging sessions, one following a 12-hour fasting period and the second after a drinking challenge of >10 mL per kg body weight (60-75 min before the second examination). High-resolution renal MRE was performed using a novel driver with rotating eccentric mass placed at the posterior-lateral wall to couple waves (50 Hz) to the kidney. The biomechanical parameters, shear wave speed (c(s) in m/s), storage modulus (G(d) in kPa), loss modulus (G(l) in kPa), phase angle (Υ = 2/atan/) and attenuation (α in 1/mm) were derived. Accurate separation of gross anatomical segments was applied in post-processing (whole kidney, cortex, medulla, sinus, vessel). Results: High-quality shear waves coupled into all gross anatomical segments of the kidney (mean shear wave displacement: 163 ± 47 μm, mean contamination of second upper harmonics <23%, curl/divergence: 4.3 ± 0.8). Regardless of the hydration state, median G(d) of the cortex and medulla (0.68 ± 0.11 kPa) was significantly higher than that of the sinus and vessels (0.48 ± 0.06 kPa), and consistently, significant differences were found in c(s), Υ, and G(l) (all p < 0.001). The viscoelastic parameters of cortex and medulla were not significantly different. After hydration sinus exhibited a small but significant reduction in median G(d) by -0.02 ± 0.04 kPa (p = 0.01), and, consequently, the cortico-sinusoidal-difference in G(d) increased by 0.04 ± 0.07 kPa (p = 0.05). Only upon hydration, the attenuation in vessels became lower (0.084 ± 0.013 1/mm) and differed significantly from the whole kidney (0.095 ± 0.007 1/mm, p = 0.01). Conclusion: High-resolution renal MRE with an innovative driver and well-defined 3D segmentation can resolve all renal segments, especially when including the sinus in the analysis. Even after a prolonged hydration period the approach is sensitive to small hydration-related changes in the sinus and in the cortico-sinusoidal-difference.

rotating_wall,27526111,Numerical Simulation of Mass Transfer and Three-Dimensional Fabrication of Tissue-Engineered Cartilages Based on Chitosan/Gelatin Hybrid Hydrogel Scaffold in a Rotating Bioreactor.,"Cartilage tissue engineering is believed to provide effective cartilage repair post-injuries or diseases. Biomedical materials play a key role in achieving successful culture and fabrication of cartilage. The physical properties of a chitosan/gelatin hybrid hydrogel scaffold make it an ideal cartilage biomimetic material. In this study, a chitosan/gelatin hybrid hydrogel was chosen to fabricate a tissue-engineered cartilage in vitro by inoculating human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) at both dynamic and traditional static culture conditions. A bioreactor that provides a dynamic culture condition has received greater applications in tissue engineering due to its optimal mass transfer efficiency and its ability to simulate an equivalent physical environment compared to human body. In this study, prior to cell-scaffold fabrication experiment, mathematical simulations were confirmed with a mass transfer of glucose and TGF-β2 both in rotating wall vessel bioreactor (RWVB) and static culture conditions in early stage of culture via computational fluid dynamic (CFD) method. To further investigate the feasibility of the mass transfer efficiency of the bioreactor, this RWVB was adopted to fabricate three-dimensional cell-hydrogel cartilage constructs in a dynamic environment. The results showed that the mass transfer efficiency of RWVB was faster in achieving a final equilibrium compared to culture in static culture conditions. ADSCs culturing in RWVB expanded three times more compared to that in static condition over 10 days. Induced cell cultivation in a dynamic RWVB showed extensive expression of extracellular matrix, while the cell distribution was found much more uniformly distributing with full infiltration of extracellular matrix inside the porous scaffold. The increased mass transfer efficiency of glucose and TGF-β2 from RWVB promoted cellular proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation of ADSCs inside chitosan/gelatin hybrid hydrogel scaffolds. The improved mass transfer also accelerated a dynamic fabrication of cell-hydrogel constructs, providing an alternative method in tissue engineering cartilage.",Zhu Y; Song K; Jiang S; Chen J; Tang L; Li S; Fan J; Wang Y; Zhao J; Liu T,Chitosan/gelatin hybrid hydrogel; Mass transfer efficiency; Rotating wall vessel bioreactor; Static culture; Tissue-engineered cartilage,2017,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,Journal Article,,

Recent studies have described histologic and biochemical changes in rat intervertebral discs after space travel, but there is still no in vitro model to investigate the effects of microgravity on disc metabolism. PURPOSE: To study the effects of microgravity on disc degeneration and establish an in vitro simulated microgravity study model. STUDY DESIGN: Discs were cultured in static and rotating conditions in bioreactor, and the characteristics of disc degeneration were evaluated. METHODS: The mice discs were cultured in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor where the microgravity condition was simulated. Intervertebral discs were cultured in static and microgravity condition. Histology, biochemistry, and immunohistochemical assays were performed to evaluate the characteristics of the discs in microgravity condition. RESULTS: Intervertebral discs cultured in rotating bioreactors were found to develop changes of disc degeneration manifested by reduced red Safranin-O staining within the annulus fibrosus, downregulated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content and GAG/hydroxyproline ratio, increased matrix metalloproteinase 3 expression, and upregulated apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that simulated microgravity induces the molecular changes of disc degeneration.

These options vary in their methods, principles, and suitability for use with suspension cell culture. Here, a cell culture method is described for subjecting lymphocytes to simulated microgravity using a commercially available rotary cell culture system, also known as a 2D clinostat or a rotating wall vessel (RWV) device. This cell culture method utilizes the principle of time-averaged gravity vector nullification to simulate microgravity by rotating the cells on a horizontal axis. The cells cultured in this system can be harvested and utilized in many different experimental assays to assess the effects of simulated microgravity on cellular function and physiology. The culturing technique may vary slightly depending on the cell type or line that is used, but the method described here may be applied to any suspension-type cell culture.",de Korte M; Keating A; Wang C,,2022,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Video-Audio Media",,

The tracheal defect (55 mm x 30 mm) was located at the thoracic inlet adjacent to the major mediastinal vessels. Our reconstructive procedure was a two-staged surgery. In the first stage, a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap was transferred to the neck to provide a well-vascularized recipient bed for free costal cartilage grafts and to cover large vessels. Two pieces of free costal cartilage were grafted on the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap, one for the lateral wall reconstruction and the other prefabricated for the anterior wall of the trachea. In the second stage, the re-vascularized cartilage graft for the anterior wall of the trachea with overlying skin was rotated onto the trough of the remaining trachea and the closure of the tracheal defect was completed. We conclude that free cartilage grafts for the reconstruction of a large cervico-mediastinal tracheal defect can be safely used when they are combined with well-vascularized pectoralis major myocutaneous flaps.",Nakahira M; Nakatani H; Takeuchi S; Higashiyama K; Fukushima K,,2006,"Auris, nasus, larynx",Case Reports; Journal Article,,

The upgrade has resulted in a more robust and reliable diagnostic than before, which is described. Drifts in the mirror angle reconstructed from quadrature encoder signals are found, a reference signal being required. The use of the small scanning mirrors necessitated the inclusion of focusing mirrors to maintain throughput into the vacuum ultraviolet spectrometers.

Several techniques have been developed to improve the spatial calibration of the CXRS diagnostic. The sightline location was obtained by measuring the coordinates of three points on each sightline using an articulated flexible coordinate measuring arm when the vessel was accessible. After vacuum pumping, the effect of pressure change in the vacuum vessel was evaluated by observing the movement of the light spot from back-illuminated sightlines on the first wall using the newly developed articulated inspection arm. In addition, the rotation of the periscope after vacuum pumping was derived by using the Doppler shift of neutral beam emission spectra without magnetic field. Combining these techniques, improved spatial calibration was implemented to provide a complete and accurate description of the EAST CXRS system. Due to the effects of the change of air pressure, a ∼0.4° periscope rotation, yielding a ∼20 mm movement of the major radius of observation positions to the lower field side, was derived. Results of Zeeman splitting of neutral beam emission spectra with magnetic field also showed good agreement with the calibration results.",Yin XH; Li YY; Fu J; Jiang D; Feng SY; Gu YQ; Cheng Y; Lyu B; Shi YJ; Ye MY; Wan BN,,2016,The Review of scientific instruments,Journal Article,,

Pilot studies were performed to determine techniques to visualize and analyze 3-D PA-like tissues as well as to develop successful strategies to culture 3T3-L1 cells in a high aspect ratio vessel rotating-wall bioreactor both with and without microcarriers. Next, a series of cultures were accessed to verify these techniques as well as to compare the culture of the cells with and without microcarriers. Finally, a perfused rotating-wall bioreactor was used to further investigate the nature of the aggregates or tissues being generated. The aggregates that formed in the perfused system were analyzed via histology and in vivo animal studies.

rotating_wall,16586503,Model of the mass transport to the surface of animal cells cultured in a rotating bioreactor operated in micro gravity.,"A mathematical model is used to investigate the transport of dissolved oxygen from the bulk fluid to the surface of aggregates of animal cells cultured in a rotating bioreactor. These aggregates move through different regions of the bioreactor with a local flow field and concentration distribution that vary with time. The time variation of the Sherwood number and the surface concentration for a range of parameters typical of a cell science experiment executed in the Rotating Wall Perfused Vessel (RWPV) bioreactor in space are investigated. The Reynolds numbers experienced by the aggregate are generally low (Re < 1) and the Peclet numbers range from O(1) to O(100). Comparison of the results from the numerical solution of the mathematical model with those from a quasi-steady model, using a steady-state correlation for mass transport on a sphere, indicate that the quasi-steady assumption is not a good model to compute the instantaneous Sherwood number. This indicates a significant history effect in the Sherwood number response to the variations of acceleration of the aggregates in the bioreactor. A high resistance to the mass transport from the bulk fluid to the surface of the aggregate exists for the bioreactor operated in micro gravity. The difference between the surface concentration and the free stream concentration was as high as 30% for aggregates larger than 3 mm. Diffusion reduces the variations of the free stream concentration resulting in a nearly constant value for the concentration at the surface of the aggregates.",Rivera-Solorio I; Kleis SJ,,2006,Biotechnology and bioengineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Two established human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines, HT-29, an undifferentiated, and HT-29KM, a stable, moderately differentiated subline of HT-29, were grown in new tissue culture bioreactors called Rotating-Wall Vessels (RWVs). RWVs are used in conjunction with multicellular cocultivation to develop a unique in vitro tissue modeling system. Cells were cultivated on Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads, with and without mixed normal human colonic fibroblasts, which served as the mesenchymal layer. Culture of the tumor lines in the absence of fibroblasts produced spheroidlike growth and minimal differentiation. In contrast, when tumor lines were co-cultivated with normal colonic fibroblasts, initial growth was confined to the fibroblast population until the microcarriers were covered. The tumor cells then commenced proliferation at an accelerated rate, organizing themselves into three-dimensional tissue masses that achieved 1.0- to 1.5-cm diameters. The masses displayed glandular structures, apical and internal glandular microvilli, tight intercellular junctions, desmosomes, cellular polarity, sinusoid development, internalized mucin, and structural organization akin to normal colon crypt development. Differentiated samples were subjected to transmission and scanning electron microscopy and histologic analysis, revealing embryoniclike mesenchymal cells lining the areas around the growth matrices. Necrosis was minimal throughout the tissue masses. These data suggest that the RWV affords a new model for investigation and isolation of growth, regulatory, and structural processes within neoplastic and normal tissue.",Goodwin TJ; Jessup JM; Wolf DA,,1992,In vitro cellular & developmental biology : journal of the Tissue Culture,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,

Rotating wall vessel bioreactors generate simulated microgravity conditions ex vivo, which lead to cell aggregation. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have been extensively investigated and shown to possess the potential to differentiate into several cell lineages. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effect of simulated microgravity on all genes expressed in hMSCs, with the underlying hypothesis that many important pathways are affected during culture within a rotating wall vessel system. Gene expression was analyzed using a whole genome microarray and clustering with the aid of the National Institutes of Health's Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery database and gene ontology analysis. Our analysis showed 882 genes that were downregulated and 505 genes that were upregulated after exposure to simulated microgravity. Gene ontology clustering revealed a wide variety of affected genes with respect to cell compartment, biological process, and signaling pathway clusters. The data sets showed significant decreases in osteogenic and chondrogenic gene expression and an increase in adipogenic gene expression, indicating that ex vivo adipose tissue engineering may benefit from simulated microgravity.

rotating_wall,20692703,The generation of 3-D tissue models based on hyaluronan hydrogel-coated microcarriers within a rotating wall vessel bioreactor.,"With the increasing necessity for functional tissue- and organ equivalents in the clinic, the optimization of techniques for the in vitro generation of organotypic structures that closely resemble the native tissue is of paramount importance. The engineering of a variety of highly differentiated tissues has been achieved using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology, which is an optimized suspension culture allowing cells to grow in three-dimensions (3-D). However, certain cell types require the use of scaffolds, such as collagen-coated microcarrier beads, for optimal growth and differentiation in the RWV. Removal of the 3-D structures from the microcarriers involves enzymatic treatment, which disrupts the delicate 3-D architecture and makes it inapplicable for potential implantation. Therefore, we designed a microcarrier bead coated with a synthetic extracellular matrix (ECM) composed of a disulfide-crosslinked hyaluronan and gelatin hydrogel for 3-D tissue engineering, that allows for enzyme-free cell detachment under mild reductive conditions (i.e. by a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction). The ECM-coated beads (ECB) served as scaffold to culture human intestinal epithelial cells (Int-407) in the RWV, which formed viable multi-layered cell aggregates and expressed epithelial differentiation markers. The cell aggregates remained viable following dissociation from the microcarriers, and could be returned to the RWV bioreactor for further culturing into bead-free tissue assemblies. The developed ECBs thus offer the potential to generate scaffold-free 3-D tissue assemblies, which could further be explored for tissue replacement and remodeling.",Skardal A; Sarker SF; Crabbé A; Nickerson CA; Prestwich GD,,2010,Biomaterials,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",R21MH080702/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States,

BACKGROUND: Rotational atherectomy has been shown to be safe and efficient for the treatment of ISR, but the recurrence rate is still high. Intracoronary beta-irradiation after rotational atherectomy may be a reasonable approach to prevent recurrent ISR. METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients with diffuse ISR (length >10 mm) in native coronary arteries underwent rotational atherectomy and adjunctive balloon angioplasty, followed by beta-irradiation using a (188)Re-MAG(3)-filled balloon catheter. The radiation dose was 15 Gy at a depth of 1.0 mm into the vessel wall. RESULTS: The mean lengths of the lesion and irradiated segment were 25.6 +/- 12.7 mm and 37.6 +/- 11.2 mm, respectively. Radiation was delivered successfully to all patients, with a mean irradiation time of 201.8 +/- 61.7 s. No adverse event, including myocardial infarction, death or stent thrombosis, occurred during the follow-up period (mean 10.3 +/- 3.7 months), and nontarget vessel revascularization was needed in one patient. The six-month binary angiographic restenosis rate was 10.4%, and the loss index was 0.17 +/- 0.31. CONCLUSIONS: Beta-irradiation using a (188)Re-MAG(3)-filled balloon after rotational atherectomy is safe and feasible in patients with diffuse ISR, and it may improve their clinical and angiographic outcomes. Further prospective, randomized trials are warranted to evaluate the synergistic effect of debulking and irradiation in patients with diffuse ISR.",Park SW; Hong MK; Moon DH; Oh SJ; Lee CW; Kim JJ; Park SJ,,2001,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,16760899,Simulated microgravity induced damage in human retinal pigment epithelial cells.,"PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to determine the potential damage to the human retina that may occur from weightlessness during space flight using simulated microgravity. METHODS: Human retinal pigment epithelial (hRPE) cells were cultured for 24 h in a National Aeronautics and Space Administration-designed rotating wall bioreactor vessel to mimic the microgravity environment of space. Single-stranded breaks in hRPE DNA induced by simulated gravity were measured using the comet assay. In addition, the production of the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was measured in these cells 48 h after recovery from simulated microgravity exposure. RESULTS: Simulated microgravity induced single-stranded breaks in the hRPE DNA that were not repaired within 48 h. Furthermore, PG E2 production was dramatically increased 48 h after the initial microgravity-induced damage, indicating the induction of an inflammatory response. There was less DNA damage and no PGE2 release in hRPE cells pretreated with the antiinflammatory agent cysteine during their exposure to microgravity. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that the microgravity environment generated by a NASA-designed rotating wall bioreactor vessel induces an inflammatory response in hRPE cells. This system thus constitutes a new model system for the study of inflammation in the retina, a system that does not involve the introduction of an exogenous chemical agent or supplementary irradiation. This in vitro method may also be useful for testing novel therapeutic approaches for suppression of retinal inflammation. Furthermore, we suggest a safe prophylactic treatment for prevention of acute, transitory, or enhanced age-related permanent blindness in astronauts or flight personnel engaged in long-haul flights.",Roberts JE; Kukielczak BM; Chignell CF; Sik BH; Hu DN; Principato MA,,2006,Molecular vision,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural",Intramural NIH HHS/United States,

Based on the postoperative course of this case, we think a combined myocutaneous flap of teres major and latissimus dorsi muscles with two nourishing vessels as an alternative is a very useful, safe, and secure method for the treatment of cases with axillary damages which require one-stage and stable reconstruction, like our patient.",Ono I; Tateshita T,,2001,Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,Case Reports; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,35808905,Field and saccharification performances of poplars severely downregulated in CAD1.,"Lignin is one of the main factors causing lignocellulosic biomass recalcitrance to enzymatic hydrolysis. Glasshouse-grown poplars severely downregulated for CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE 1 (CAD1), the enzyme catalysing the last step in the monolignol-specific branch of lignin biosynthesis, have increased saccharification yields and normal growth. Here, we assess the performance of these hpCAD poplars in the field under short rotation coppice culture for two consecutive rotations of 1 yr and 3 yr. While 1-yr-old hpCAD wood had 10% less lignin, 3-yr-old hpCAD wood had wild-type lignin levels. Because of their altered cell wall composition, including elevated levels of cinnamaldehydes, both 1-yr-old and 3-yr-old hpCAD wood showed enhanced saccharification yields upon harsh alkaline pretreatments (up to +85% and +77%, respectively). In contrast with previous field trials with poplars less severely downregulated for CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE (CAD), the hpCAD poplars displayed leaning phenotypes, early bud set, early flowering and yield penalties. Moreover, hpCAD wood had enlarged vessels, decreased wood density and reduced relative and free water contents. Our data show that the phenotypes of CAD-deficient poplars are strongly dependent on the environment and underpin the importance of field trials in translating basic research towards applications.",De Meester B; Van Acker R; Wouters M; Traversari S; Steenackers M; Neukermans J; Van Breusegem F; Déjardin A; Pilate G; Boerjan W,CAD; field trial; lignin engineering; poplar; saccharification; water content; wood,2022,The New phytologist,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,33245456,An update on vessel preparation in lower limb arterial intervention.,"BACKGROUND: Plain balloon angioplasty has traditionally been used to treat lower limb arterial disease but can be limited by significant residual stenosis, vessel recoil, dissection, and by late restenosis. Appropriate vessel preparation may significantly improve short and long-term outcomes. We aim to give an overview of some of the devices currently available, or under investigation, for vessel preparation in the lower limb. MAIN TEXT: Vessel preparation devices include those that remove plaque (atherectomy devices) and those that modify plaque. The four groups of plaque removing atherectomy devices are defined by their plaque removal method: Directional, rotational orbital and excimer laser are categories of devices investigated for plaque modification. Intravascular lithotripsy devices generate sonic pulsatile pressure waves that pass into the vessel wall cracking calcified plaques whilst sparing soft tissue. This enables dilatation of calcified lesions at low pressure by conventional balloons and enables full stent expansion. Other balloon based vessel preparation devices were designed to modify plaque and produce more controlled, lower pressure luminal expansion without major dissections and potentially with less recoil than conventional angioplasty balloons. Scoring balloons have a helical nitinol element attached to the balloon that scores plaque facilitating uniform luminal enlargement. Further specialty balloons have been developed in recent years, including the Chocolate, Phoenix and Serranator balloons. Finally, the temporary Spur self-expanding retrievable nitinol stent has a series of radially aligned spurs that are driven into the vessel wall by post-dilatation, potentially improving drug delivery. CONCLUSION: Lesion specific vessel preparation aims to improve both short and long term outcomes through improved penetration of anti-proliferative drug, maximising luminal gain, reducing the need for stent placement and minimising intimal injury. Some forms of vessel preparation appear to improve short term outcomes; long-term outcomes remain uncertain. An overview of some of the multiple devices available for vessel preparation is presented.",Ormiston W; Dyer-Hartnett S; Fernando R; Holden A,"Atherectomy; Cutting balloon; Intravascular lithotripsy; Peripheral arterial disease; Scoring balloon, specialty balloon, chocolate balloon, Serranator balloon, spur; Vessel preparation",2020,CVIR endovascular,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,17307442,Coronary insufficiency after stentless aortic root replacement: risk factors and solutions.,"BACKGROUND: Coronary insufficiency is a dreaded complication of total aortic root replacement (ARR) with few defined risk factors. This study describes the incidence, risk factors, management options, and outcomes of this condition after ARR with stentless porcine valves. METHODS: The study consisted of a retrospective analysis of 503 patients (mean age, 68.9 +/- 10.2 years) undergoing stentless porcine total ARR (Medtronic Freestyle and St. Jude Toronto) between the years 1993 and 2005 at a single institution. Coronary insufficiency was defined as the need for unplanned bypass grafting during, or after removal from cardiopulmonary bypass to correct wall motion abnormalities, arrhythmias, or right ventricular failure in the absence of known obstructive coronary disease. RESULTS: A total of 13 cases of right coronary artery and no cases of left coronary insufficiency were identified (overall incidence 13 of 503, 2.6%). All were treated with aortocoronary bypass grafting to the right coronary artery using saphenous vein. Compared with patients who did not have coronary insufficiency, patients with this complication were more likely to be female (11 of 13, 85%, versus 201 of 490, 41%; p = 0.006), had higher mean body mass index (34.6 +/- 12.0 kg/m2 versus 28.3 +/- 3.8 kg/m2, p = 0.04), and were implanted with smaller prostheses (23.9 +/- 2.1 mm versus 25.6 +/- 2.4 mm, p = 0.026), a finding not explained by the preponderance of female sex. Mean age, ejection fraction, and other demographic variables were similar. Despite longer cardiopulmonary bypass times (238 +/- 61 minutes versus 180 +/- 35 minutes, p = 0.005), operative mortality was not significantly different (1 of 13, 7.7%, versus 29 of 490, 5.9%; p = not significant). CONCLUSIONS: Coronary artery insufficiency is uncommon after stentless aortic root replacement and more often affects the right coronary artery. Risk factors appear to be female sex, higher body mass index, and small aortic root. Preventive measures include recognition of coronary orientation, routine valve rotation, and adequate coronary button mobilization. When this complication occurs, good outcomes can still be obtained with early recognition and prompt bypass grafting.",Kincaid EH; Cordell AR; Hammon JW; Adair SM; Kon ND,,2007,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,10769413,Coronary calcification: assessment by intravascular ultrasound imaging.,"The role of intralesional coronary calcification is not only an important prognostic factor with respect to interventions, but can be extremely important with respect to diagnostic classification of lesion subsets. Intravascular ultrasound details the relationship between plaque and vessel wall in real time throughout the coronary arterial tree. This provides the opportunity to exactly define not only the quantity but also the distribution of calcium within the vessel wall. This is particularly important from a diagnostic standpoint, as plaque-containing calcification can often lead to ambiguous or erroneous angiographic information. Being able to classify different plaque substructures with intravascular ultrasound can help not only to clarify the ambiguous angiogram but delineate the exact nature of luminal encroachment. From a treatment standpoint, the identification of calcification patterns, particularly those on the superficial intimal surface, can alert the operator to change the compliance prior to definitive therapy. High-speed rotational atherectomy is a technique that provides significant de-calcification in preparation for optimizing the stent geometry within such lesion subsets. Although electron beam computed tomography can accurately locate calcification patterns within the coronary tree in a non-invasive manner, it's often difficult to know the extent of calcification and the relationship to fibrofatty plaques. Intravascular ultrasound albeit invasive, provides the opportunity to delineate these plaque substructures and potentially identify lesion subsets that may have an important natural history in the development of coronary atherosclerosis.",Maehara A; Fitzgerald PJ,,2000,Zeitschrift fur Kardiologie,Journal Article; Review,,
rotating_wall,32531694,A new technique for the 3D reconstruction of the incisional hernia: A pilot study.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to accurately evaluate incisional hernias with a new three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction technology, proving surgeons more information for intuitive and accurate judgments about incisional hernia to minimize the perioperative complications and recurrence rate. METHOD: This was a pilot study using a new technique, 3D reconstruction, based on computed tomography (CT) scans to measure abdominal wall defect, herniary area, herniary volume, abdominal cavity volume, and the volume of transverse, oblique, and recti abdominis in three patients with incisional hernias. RESULTS: The 3D reconstruction technique made automated segmentation of the bony skeleton, skin, outer abdominal wall, vessel, and hernia sac. The hernia sac, abdominal muscles, and their anatomic relationship were clearly illustrated in 3D reconstruction images. Moreover, abdominal cavity volume; herniary diameter, area, and volume; and the volume of transverse, oblique, and recti muscles could be evaluated through 3D reconstruction images. Surgeons can also freely combine, rotate, scale, and move the 3D reconstruction mode, modify the name and transparency of the 3D reconstruction model, and observe the internal structure of the tissue and the size, shape, and location of the lesion from multiple angles for better and accurate judgments. CONCLUSION: The herniary diameter, area, and volume and the volume of transverse, oblique, and recti abdominis can be accurately calculated through this 3D reconstruction technology. A three-dimensional vision of the abdomen through this technology can objectively and quantitatively evaluate the situation of incisional hernia, providing a more realistic means for diagnosis and treatment of incisional hernias.",Zhang Q; Fu X; He K; Chen H; Zheng Y; Feng X; Yao Q,Abdominal wall; Incisional hernia; Three-dimensional imaging,2020,Clinical imaging,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,34037592,[Evaluation and percutaneous treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions].,"Patients with severely calcified coronary lesions undergoing percutaneous revascularization have a substantial risk of adverse outcomes, both during the procedure and in the long term. Over the last decade, a renewed interest has been observed about devices for plaque modification and lesion preparation, new technologies have been introduced in clinical practice and well-known devices have undergone technical and procedural improvements. The available tools for intravascular imaging allow a detailed evaluation of the calcific plaques within all the layers of the vessel wall. The complementary use of all these tools is ultimately aimed at optimizing the mechanics of balloon angioplasty and the delivery and expansion of drug-eluting stents. It has been fully demonstrated that rotational atherectomy improves procedural success when treating heavily calcified lesions. Intravascular lithotripsy, techniques and materials used during complex procedures such as chronic total occlusions, increasing operators' experience, as well as new drug-eluting stents with excellent mechanical characteristics, have further contributed to the feasibility and the safety of treating most fibrotic and heavily calcified vessels. We finally propose an algorithm for evaluation and treatment of severely calcific coronary lesions to demonstrate how such percutaneous revascularization procedures are planned and performed.",Andò G; Vizzari G; Niccoli G; Calabrò P; Zimarino M; Spaccarotella C; De Rosa S; Piccolo R; Gragnano F; Mancone M; Muscoli S; Romeo F; Indolfi C,,2021,Giornale italiano di cardiologia (2006),Journal Article,,

The pathophysiology and management of this uncommon complication are reviewed. Although vertebral and carotid artery dissections are unusual events occurring in 2.5 to 3 per 100,000 people, they are increasingly acknowledged to be important causes of stroke in the young and middle-aged adult population accounting for up to 25% of such cases. VADs are associated with a variety of minor traumatic mechanisms including painting a ceiling, yoga, chiropractic manipulation of the spine, and driving. These events cause injury to the vessel wall either by shearing forces secondary to rotational injuries or direct trauma to the vessel wall on bony prominences, especially the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae. We present a case of a patient with documented previously normal vertebral arterial anatomy who developed a VAD after mediastinal tube removal resulted in subcutaneous emphysema tracking through fascial planes into his neck.",Rabkin DG; Benharash P; Shemin RJ,,2011,Journal of cardiac surgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,,

A direct numerical simulation adopting an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian based finite element method is employed in simulating the thermal motion of the particle suspended in the fluid contained in a cylindrical vessel. The instantaneous flow around the particle and the particle motion are fully resolved. The numerical results show that (a) the calculated temperature of the nearly neutrally buoyant Brownian particle in a quiescent fluid satisfies the equipartition theorem; (b) the translational and rotational decay of the velocity autocorrelation functions result in algebraic tails, over long time; (c) the translational and rotational mean square displacements of the particle obeys Stokes-Einstein and Stokes-Einstein-Debye relations, respectively; and (d) the parallel and perpendicular diffusivities of the particle closer to the wall are consistent with the analytical results, where available.

rotating_wall,30181350,Modeling Host-Pathogen Interactions in the Context of the Microenvironment: Three-Dimensional Cell Culture Comes of Age.,"Tissues and organs provide the structural and biochemical landscapes upon which microbial pathogens and commensals function to regulate health and disease. While flat two-dimensional (2-D) monolayers composed of a single cell type have provided important insight into understanding host-pathogen interactions and infectious disease mechanisms, these reductionist models lack many essential features present in the native host microenvironment that are known to regulate infection, including three-dimensional (3-D) architecture, multicellular complexity, commensal microbiota, gas exchange and nutrient gradients, and physiologically relevant biomechanical forces (e.g., fluid shear, stretch, compression). A major challenge in tissue engineering for infectious disease research is recreating this dynamic 3-D microenvironment (biological, chemical, and physical/mechanical) to more accurately model the initiation and progression of host-pathogen interactions in the laboratory. Here we review selected 3-D models of human intestinal mucosa, which represent a major portal of entry for infectious pathogens and an important niche for commensal microbiota. We highlight seminal studies that have used these models to interrogate host-pathogen interactions and infectious disease mechanisms, and we present this literature in the appropriate historical context. Models discussed include 3-D organotypic cultures engineered in the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, extracellular matrix (ECM)-embedded/organoid models, and organ-on-a-chip (OAC) models.

rotating_wall,25300886,Challenges and limitations of patient-specific vascular phantom fabrication using 3D Polyjet printing.,"Additive manufacturing (3D printing) technology offers a great opportunity towards development of patient-specific vascular anatomic models, for medical device testing and physiological condition evaluation. However, the development process is not yet well established and there are various limitations depending on the printing materials, the technology and the printer resolution. Patient-specific neuro-vascular anatomy was acquired from computed tomography angiography and rotational digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The volumes were imported into a Vitrea 3D workstation (Vital Images Inc.) and the vascular lumen of various vessels and pathologies were segmented using a ""marching cubes"" algorithm. The results were exported as Stereo Lithographic (STL) files and were further processed by smoothing, trimming, and wall extrusion (to add a custom wall to the model). The models were printed using a Polyjet printer, Eden 260V (Objet-Stratasys). To verify the phantom geometry accuracy, the phantom was reimaged using rotational DSA, and the new data was compared with the initial patient data. The most challenging part of the phantom manufacturing was removal of support material. This aspect could be a serious hurdle in building very tortuous phantoms or small vessels. The accuracy of the printed models was very good: distance analysis showed average differences of 120 μm between the patient and the phantom reconstructed volume dimensions. Most errors were due to residual support material left in the lumen of the phantom. Despite the post-printing challenges experienced during the support cleaning, this technology could be a tremendous benefit to medical research such as in device development and testing.",Ionita CN; Mokin M; Varble N; Bednarek DR; Xiang J; Snyder KV; Siddiqui AH; Levy EI; Meng H; Rudin S,3D printing; CT; Cone-Beam CT; Vascular phantoms; additive manufacturing; patient specific phantoms,2014,Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering,Journal Article,R01 EB002873/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States,

A retrospective analysis of vulvar reconstruction using the new method 'internal pudendal perforator artery-based gull wing flap' was performed from April 2012 to December 2013. A perforator vessel from the internal pudendal artery was detected with a portable Doppler and marked, and this was the pivot point around which the flap was rotated. The flap was rotated by more than 150°-180° internally, and the labium and the external wall of the vagina were reconstructed with sufficient volume. Anatomical and aesthetic reconstruction of the labium and the vagina was performed without serious complications. Functional and aesthetic vulvar reconstruction can be achieved by using a flap that provides sufficient volume of the labium.

Embryonic bone formation encompasses a cascade of chondrogenic and osteogenic events, which can be altered by changes in gravitational loading. These studies were conducted to determine if the chondrogenic cascade in bone formation would be enhanced or hindered in the unique culture environment of the RWV. Embryonic mouse pre-bone tissues were placed in the RWV at one of four different stages of chondrogenesis, ranging from undifferentiated mesenchyme cells to chondrocytes on the verge of undergoing terminal chondrocyte differentiation. After culture, tissues were analyzed for their size, the amount of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and their ability to form a mineralized matrix. Tissue consisting of cells at the early phase of chondrogenesis grew very little and did not differentiate or mineralize when cultured in the RWV. Some tissues were cultured for short periods in the RWV then cultured in standard culture dishes (SCD). Following this culture regime, the cartilage grew only a small amount, but alkaline phosphatase activity increased, and some mineralized regions formed. The pattern of mineralization was abnormal, with two mineralized zones at each end of the cartilage instead of a single central zone. Tissues that were at the three more advanced stages of chondrogenesis when placed in the RWV showed substantial growth, differentiation and mineralization. Mineralization patterns in these older tissues was normal. Tissues at the oldest stage of chondrogenesis showed more growth and as much or more mineralization as tissue cultured only in SCD. These data suggest that exposure to the RWV at early stages of chondrogenesis severely limits the ability for cartilage growth and yields abnormal downstream morphogenesis. However, at later stages of chondrogenesis, the RWV environment may be beneficial and enhance growth and development. Future studies to characterize intercellular signaling molecules and gene expression activities of chondrocytes in the RWV will be valuable for understanding the mechanism of skeletogenesis.",Klement BJ; Young QM; George BJ; Nokkaew M,NASA Discipline Developmental Biology; Non-NASA Center,2004,Bone,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",RR-03034/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States,

However, the cause of this phenomenon is still a matter of controversy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation between the direction of ST-segment-heart rate (ST-HR) loop rotation and reversible myocardial ischemia in the infarct-related area. A total of 58 patients were enrolled in this study. They had healed anterior wall myocardial infarctions with single-vessel coronary artery disease and exercise-induced ST-segment elevations in the infarct-related leads, as observed on treadmill exercise electrocardiograms. All patients underwent treadmill exercise electrocardiography and dobutamine stress echocardiography at discharge. The direction of rotation of the ST-HR loop constructed from the treadmill exercise electrocardiogram and the dobutamine stress echocardiographic findings in the infarct-related area were compared. Counterclockwise rotation was seen in 26 of 58 patients. Compared with clockwise rotation, patients with counterclockwise rotation had significantly more viable myocardium (92% vs 69%, p = 0.04) and presence of reversible myocardial ischemia (58% vs 6%, p < 0.01). On the basis of the counterclockwise rotation findings, the diagnostic value of the presence of reversible myocardial ischemia was calculated. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy was 88%, 73%, and 77%, respectively. Counterclockwise rotation of ST-HR loops was strongly related to reversible myocardial ischemia in the infarct-related area. In conclusion, our results have shown that analysis of ST-HR loops may be useful in evaluating the cause of exercise-induced ST-segment elevation in infarct-related leads.",Taniai S; Koide Y; Yotsukura M; Nishimura T; Kachi E; Sakata K; Yoshino H,,2006,The American journal of cardiology,Comparative Study; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,24207045,"Ruptured ""occult"" aneurysm disclosed by three-dimensional angiographic reconstructions.","Rotational angiographic sequences and their three-dimensional reconstructions have led to major improvements in angiographic diagnostics, especially in the study of brain aneurysms. Reconstructions accurately depict the morphology of the aneurysm, namely any wall irregularities and the possible origin of arterial branches from the aneurysmal sac, and display the aneurysm on multiple spatial planes, measuring its different diameters and ratios (particularly the dome to neck ratio). Lastly, three-dimensional angiographic reconstructions will sometimes disclose ruptured or intact aneurysms not depicted by digital subtraction angiography. A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency room of Maggiore Hospital, Bologna Local Health Trust, presenting severe headache, confusion and nuchal rigidity. Emergency CT scan disclosed cisternal subarachnoid haemorrhage. Subsequent 3D sequences revealed an aneurysm of the left carotid artery siphon. This occult aneurysm found in our patient had been masked by the overlying infundibular origin of the posterior communicating artery. This prevented detection of the lesion not only in standard oblique anteroposterior, craniocaudal and lateral sequences but also in the rotational sequence. Identification of the aneurysm in our patient was the result of the diagnostic strategy adopted. When cisternal subarachnoid haemorrhage is detected, our protocol routinely includes a rotational angiographic sequence centred on the anterior circulation and on the posterior circulation when the standard examination fails to depict the course of all the vessels or when the features of subarachnoid haemorrhage strongly suggest aneurysm rupture in that anatomical location. Three-dimensional angiographic reconstructions are extremely useful not only to characterize brain aneurysms, but also to disclose ruptured occult aneurysms and additional zero grade lesions.",Dall'olio M; Princiotta C; Leonardi M,,2009,The neuroradiology journal,Journal Article,,

rotating_wall,29171957,Carotid artery longitudinal wall motion: regulatory factors and implications for arterial health.,"The carotid artery wall moves longitudinally along the length of the vessel, although little is known about what causes this motion, or what health information it represents. The overarching purpose of this dissertation was to investigate the regulation of carotid artery longitudinal wall motion (CALM) in humans, as well as how CALM can be used to infer information about arterial health. Through observational and experimental designs, we tested evidence for a structural ventricular-vascular coupling effect, which postulates that systolic anterograde CALM is influenced by the forward blood shear rate while systolic retrograde CALM is influenced by left ventricular rotation, although the data suggest a moderate influence of left ventricular rotation, and minimal influence of shear rate. In cross-sectional analyses, we demonstrated that diastolic CALM variables are better related to age and health status compared with systolic CALM displacement and that this relationship was independent of traditional measures of arterial stiffness. These experimental and observational results directed the use of diastolic CALM as a potential indicator of arterial health in subsequent studies, owing to the relative independence from systolic events. While there was no effect of 12 weeks of exercise training in healthy men on diastolic CALM variables, we observed increased systolic retrograde CALM and diastolic CALM acceleration in men with a history of resistance exercise training compared with sedentary men, suggesting an effect of habitual exercise training. Our novel findings suggest that CALM is regulated by a complex system, in part related to both arterial wall structure and ventricular-vascular coupling, and may have clinical value in complimenting measures of traditional arterial stiffness in humans. Future studies should examine whether local changes to arterial wall structure or indirect changes in regulatory control dictate differences in CALM with aging and with chronic exercise training, before integrating CALM into routine measurement of arterial health.",Au JS,,2018,"Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition",Journal Article,,

However, the microgravity conditions created by rotating wall vessel bioreactors minimize shear stress and unload the gravitational force usually placed on cells. In a microgravity environment, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and the 3D organization of cells are altered, potentially encouraging the formation of more biosimilar artificial tissues for certain cell types. Additionally, cells in these engineered tissues display lowered immunogenicity, pointing to the transplantation potential of tissues engineered in microgravity conditions. However, these benefits are not consistent across all cell types, and the long-term impact of microgravity on tissue development and stability remains an unanswered question. Even so, there is potential that with further research, microgravity tissue engineering will have productive clinical applications for medical and pharmaceutical purposes.

rotating_wall,20121206,Magnetically remote-controlled optical sensor spheres for monitoring oxygen or pH.,"Magnetic sensor macrospheres (MagSeMacs), i.e., stainless steel spheres coated with optical chemical sensors, are presented as an alternative to existing optical sensor patches and fiber-optical dip-probes. Such spheres can either be reversibly attached to the tip of an optical fiber (dip-probe) or trapped inside a vessel for read-out through the side wall. Moving the magnetic separator at the exterior enables measurements at varying positions with a single sensor. Moreover, the sensor's replacement is rapid and contactless. We measured dissolved oxygen or pH in stirred liquids, rotating flasks, and 24-well plates with a SensorDish-reader device for parallel cell culture monitoring. In these applications, MagSeMacs proved to be advantageous over conventional sensor patches and magnetic optical sensor particles because of their magnetism, spherical shape, reflectance, and size. These properties resulted in strong but reversible fixation, magnetic remote-controllability, short response times, high signal intensities, and simplified handling.",Mistlberger G; Koren K; Borisov SM; Klimant I,,2010,Analytical chemistry,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

This sensor provided the means to monitor the DO concentration in the HARV without influencing the flow pattern, thereby retaining the low shear HARV environment conducive to the formation of 3-dimensional cell aggregates. This sensor lost significant signal as a result of exposure to the first three autoclave cycles, but only minimal change in signal was observed following exposure to subsequent autoclave cycles. A new calibration model requiring only one fitted parameter was developed that accurately fit data over the entire range from 0% to 100% oxygen saturation. The ability for DO concentration control within the vessel was demonstrated by using this sensor to monitor the DO concentration inside the HARV.",Saarinen MA; Reece JS; Arnold MA; Murhammer DW,,2003,Biotechnology progress,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Validation Study",,
rotating_wall,17120789,Bioreactors for tissues of the musculoskeletal system.,"Muskuloskeletal tissue includes bone, cartilage, ligament, skeletal muscle and tendons. These tissues malfunction either due to a natural injury, trauma, or a disorder. In all cases natural regeneration needs to be enhanced by medication and, in many instances, by surgery. Surgical techniques are limited to suturing, autografts or allografts. Tissue engineering stems from the challenge presented by the limited resources for natural implants and the ineffectiveness of previous curing techniques. The challenge in tissue engineering resides in the design of a functional bioreactor that would: (1) house the engineered construct under sterile conditions; and (2) provide the appropriate stimuli that would result in a neotissue with biochemical and biomechanical properties comparable to in situ tissue. The various types and designs of bioreactors for the regeneration of musculoskeletal tissue, including spinner flask, rotating wall vessel, flow perfusion, and mechanical loading devices are presented in this paper.",Abousleiman RI; Sikavitsas VI,,2006,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,Journal Article; Review,,

rotating_wall,16326375,Impact of vessel calcification on outcomes after coronary stenting.,"BACKGROUND: Calcified coronary arteries have few viable smooth muscle cells capable of proliferating, and, subsequently, might exhibit less in-stent restenosis. We therefore studied the outcome of stenting in patients with different amounts of coronary calcification. METHODS: Six hundred twenty-one patients who underwent bare metal stenting of calcific native coronary arteries were studied retrospectively. Pre- and postinterventional intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and qualitative and quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) were performed in 662 lesions. The arc of calcium was measured, and arteries were grouped (A, B, C, and D) according to the calcium arc in IVUS (0-90 degrees , 91-180 degrees , 181-270 degrees , and 271-360 degrees , respectively). Arteries with a superficial calcium arc of < or =270 degrees (Group E) were compared to arteries with >270 degrees calcification (Group F). RESULTS: Clinical and lesion characteristics were similar, and the major complication rate was low (1.9%) in all groups. In Groups A, B, C, and D, patients with more calcific arteries had more non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) (P=.04-.002). Patients in Group F (more extensive superficial calcification) had an increased frequency of non-Q-wave MI compared to Group E. Malapposition of stents to vessel wall and use of rotational atherectomy were more frequent in Group F (P=.001). Late events including death, MI, and revascularization with either coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were not different among the groups. Extensive calcification of coronary arteries is associated with more frequent peri-procedural non-Q-wave MI. CONCLUSION: Despite the scarcity of viable cells, the late event rate in severely calcified arteries is not different from mildly calcified arteries. This may be due to more frequent malapposition of stents to vessel wall and augmented trauma during PCI in severely calcified arteries.",Mosseri M; Satler LF; Pichard AD; Waksman R,,2005,Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,Comparative Study; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,29775730,An integrated biomanufacturing platform for the large-scale expansion and neuronal differentiation of human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells.,"Human pluripotent stem cell derived neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) have the unique properties of long-term in vitro expansion as well as differentiation into the various neurons and supporting cell types of the central nervous system (CNS). Because of these characteristics, hNPCs have tremendous potential in the modeling and treatment of various CNS diseases and disorders. However, expansion and neuronal differentiation of hNPCs in quantities necessary for these applications is not possible with current two dimensional (2-D) approaches. Here, we used a fully defined peptide substrate as the basis for a microcarrier (MC)-based suspension culture system. Several independently derived hNPC lines were cultured on MCs for multiple passages as well as efficiently differentiated to neurons. Finally, this MC-based system was used in conjunction with a low shear rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor for the integrated, large-scale expansion and neuronal differentiation of hNPCs. Overall, this fully defined and scalable biomanufacturing system will facilitate the generation of hNPCs and their neuronal derivatives in quantities necessary for basic and translational applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this work, we developed a microcarrier (MC)-based culture system that allows for the expansion and neuronal differentiation of human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) under defined conditions. In turn, this MC approach was implemented in a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor for the large-scale expansion and neuronal differentiation of hNPCs. This work is of significance as it overcomes current limitations of conventional two dimensional (2-D) culture systems to enable the generation of hNPCs and their neuronal derivatives in quantities required for downstream applications in disease modeling, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. reserved.",Srinivasan G; Morgan D; Varun D; Brookhouser N; Brafman DA,Bioreactor; Chemically defined peptide substrate; Human neural progenitor cells; Large-scale; Neuronal differentiation; Pluripotent stem cells,2018,Acta biomaterialia,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",R21 EB020767/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States,

Fourteen patients had undergone a two-stage and seven patients a primary repair. Twenty patients were found to have echocardiographic images adequate for wall motion analysis. The results of these studies were correlated with thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scans. Left ventricular wall motion was assessed by measuring regional area change in parasternal and apical views. After planimetry of an end-systolic and an end-diastolic frame, the ventricle was divided into eight equal segments and the percent area change was calculated. Both a fixed reference and a floating system correcting for translation and rotation were applied. The measurements in the patient group were compared with normal age-matched values previously obtained in 55 normal infants and children. Wall motion abnormalities, found in seven patients, were located at the apex in three, at the inferior septum and anterolateral wall in one and the inferior, anterolateral and lateral walls in one patient each. All had a myocardial perfusion defect in a corresponding anatomic location. One patient with a small reversible perfusion defect at the basilar septum had normal regional wall motion. The sensitivity of detecting impairment of myocardial perfusion was 0.95. Wall motion abnormalities were found only in patients who had undergone a two-stage repair. Echocardiographic wall motion analysis can be used as a screening method to identify patients with suspected myocardial ischemia after the arterial switch operation.",Vogel M; Smallhorn JF; Trusler GA; Freedom RM,,1990,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

This is particularly true for human primary breast carcinoma cells, whose in vitro growth is shown to be limited to one or two passages in monolayer culture. Three-dimensional (3D) growth of breast cancer cells suggests that cell aggregates grown in this manner have many similarities to in vivo behavior. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary tumors obtained from five breast cancer patients were grown in 3D cultures using the rotating-wall vessel bioreactor. Tumor aggregates were assessed for DNA ploidy, cell cycle kinetics, and expression of tumor markers and cytokines. Comparisons between fresh tumor cells and 3D aggregates were performed. RESULTS: All five breast cancers were found to be aneuploid after 3D culture, with elevated S-phase fractions. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed mRNA expression of HER2/neu, H-ras, K-ras, p53, transforming growth factor-alpha, transforming growth factor-beta, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 in 3D-grown tumor cells; in most cases, expression appeared increased when compared with mRNA obtained from freshly isolated primary tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: After prolonged 3D growth in the rotating wall bioreactor, complex tissue-like constructs of primary breast tumor cells exhibited significantly increased proliferative activity in conjunction with oncogene activation and developed into aggressive aneuploid populations.",Becker JL; Blanchard DK,,2007,The Journal of surgical research,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Techniques developed to deal with this problem include the use of laser energy and rotational atherectomy. Use of a guidewire positioned between the dilating balloon and vessel wall has been reported to be effective in resistant heavily calcified lesions. The current case report describes a situation in which two wires between the balloon and the target lesion were required to produce an acceptable reduction in stenosis severity. This technique represents an extension of the single-wire technique and may have relevance to the strategy being explored with the ""cutting balloon.""",Stillabower ME,,1994,Catheterization and cardiovascular diagnosis,Case Reports; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,37454305,Effect of flow rate ratio and positioning on a lighthouse tip ECMO return cannula.,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a life-saving support therapy in the case of cardiopulmonary refractory failure. Its use is associated to complications due to the presence of artificial surfaces and supraphysiological stress conditions. Thus, knowledge of the fluid structures associated to each component can give insight into sources of blood damage. In this study, an experimentally validated numerical study of a conventional lighthouse tip cannula in return configuration was carried out to characterize the flow structures using water or a Newtonian blood analog with different flow rate ratios and cannula positioning and their influence on hemolysis. The results showed that strong shear layers developed where the jets from the side holes met the co-flow. Stationary backflow regions at the vessel wall were also present downstream of the cannula. In the tilted case, the recirculation was much more pronounced on the wide side and almost absent on the narrow side. Small vortical backflow structures developed at the side holes which behaved like obstacles to the co-flow, creating pairs of counter-rotating vortices, which induced locally higher risk of hemolysis. However, global hemolysis index did not show significant deviations. Across the examined flow rate ratios, the holes on the narrow side consistently reinfused a larger fraction of fluid. A radial force developed in the tilted case in a direction so as to recenter the cannula in the vessel.",Fiusco F; Lemétayer J; Broman LM; Prahl Wittberg L,CFD; ECMO; Hemolysis; PIV; POD; Recirculation; Return cannula,2023,Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology,Journal Article,101045453/ERC_/European Research Council/International,
rotating_wall,12951698,Space bioreactors and their applications.,"Space biology is a young and rapidly developing discipline comprising basic research and biotechnology. With the prospect of longer space missions and the construction of the International Space Station several aspects of biotechnology will play a prominent role in space. In fact, biotechnological processes allowing the recycling of vital elements, such as oxygen or water, and the in-flight production of food becomes essential when considering the financial and logistic standpoint. Every kilogram which, having been recycled or produced in space, does not have to be uploaded will drastically reduce the cost of space missions. In addition, the scientific community is offered a better opportunity to investigate long-term biotechnological processes performing experiments with a duration ranging from weeks to months. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for sophisticated instrumentation to satisfy the requirements of future projects in space biology. The carryover of knowledge from conventional bioreactor technology to miniature space bioreactors for a monitored and controlled cell culturing is one of the key elements for this new dimension in space life science. The first space bioreactors were developed and flown at the end of the last century. It has been demonstrated that cells of different types, from bacteria to mammalian cells, can be successfully grown in this type of culture vessel. This chapter presents different generations of bioreactors developed so far, their performances in space and their potential for the future, as well as the activities of the European Space Agency (ESA) in this domain.

rotating_wall,28518000,Comparison of Simulated Microgravity and Hydrostatic Pressure for Chondrogenesis of hASC.,"BACKGROUND: Cartilage tissue engineering is a growing field due to the lack of regenerative capacity of native tissue. The use of bioreactors for cartilage tissue engineering is common, but the results are controversial. Some studies suggest that microgravity bioreactors are ideal for chondrogenesis, while others show that mimicking hydrostatic pressure is crucial for cartilage formation. A parallel study comparing the effects of loading and unloading on chondrogenesis has not been performed. METHODS: The goal of this study was to evaluate chondrogenesis of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASC) under two different mechanical stimuli relative to static culture: microgravity and cyclic hydrostatic pressure (CHP). Pellets of hASC were cultured for 14 d under simulated microgravity using a rotating wall vessel bioreactor or under CHP (7.5 MPa, 1 Hz, 4 h · d-1) using a hydrostatic pressure vessel. RESULTS: We found that CHP increased mRNA expression of Aggrecan, Sox9, and Collagen II, caused a threefold increase in sulfated glycosaminoglycan production, and resulted in stronger vimentin staining intensity and organization relative to microgravity. In addition, Wnt-signaling patterns were altered in a manner that suggests that simulated microgravity decreases chondrogenic differentiation when compared to CHP. DISCUSSION: Our goal was to compare chondrogenic differentiation of hASC using a microgravity bioreactor and a hydrostatic pressure vessel, two commonly used bioreactors in cartilage tissue engineering. Our results indicate that CHP promotes hASC chondrogenesis and that microgravity may inhibit hASC chondrogenesis. Our findings further suggest that cartilage formation and regeneration might be compromised in space due to the lack of mechanical loading.Mellor LF, Steward AJ, Nordberg RC, Taylor MA, Loboa EG.

In this vessel, the duration of stationary and death phase for cultures of Spodoptera frugiperda cells was greatly extended over that achieved in shaker-flask controls. For both HARV and control cultures, S. frugiperda cells grew to concentrations in excess of 1 x 10(7) viable cells ml-1 with viabilities greater than 90%. In the HARV, stationary phase was maintained 9-15 days in contrast to 4-5 days in the shaker flask. Furthermore, the rate of cell death was reduced in the HARV by a factor of 20-90 relative to the control culture and was characterized with a death rate constant of 0.01-0.02 day-1. Beginning in the stationary phase and continuing in the death phase, there was a significant decrease in population size in the HARV versus an increase in the shaker flask. This phenomenon could represent cell adaptation to simulated microgravity and/or a change in the ratio of apoptotic to necrotic cells. Differences observed in this research between the HARV and its control were attributed to a reduction in hydrodynamic forces in the microgravity vessel.",Cowger NL; O'Connor KC; Bivins JE,,1997,Enzyme and microbial technology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,

In addition, in vitro three-dimensional fabrication of tissue-engineered bones was carried out in optimized bioreactor conditions, and in vivo implantation using fabricated bones was performed for segmental bone defects of Zelanian rabbits. The distribution of dynamic pressure, total pressure, shear stress, and velocity within the culture chamber was calculated for different scaffold locations. According to the simulation results, the dynamic pressure, velocity, and shear stress around the surface of cell-scaffold construction periodically changed at different locations of the RWVB, which could result in periodical stress stimulation for fabricated tissue constructs. However, overall shear stresses were relatively low, and the fluid velocities were uniform in the bioreactor. Our in vitro experiments showed that the number of cells cultured in the RWVB was five times higher than those cultured in a T-flask. The tissue-engineered bones grew very well in the RWVB. This study demonstrates that stress stimulation in an RWVB can be beneficial for cell/bio-derived bone constructs fabricated in an RWVB, with an application for repairing segmental bone defects.",Song K; Wang H; Zhang B; Lim M; Liu Y; Liu T,,2013,Cell stress & chaperones,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

With this in mind, we developed a novel bioreactor that fits into a NMR instrument and in which the simulated weightlessness conditions are obtained by a suitable medium and a flow-lift suspension.

Unlike ""classical"" non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS), gastroenteritis is often absent during ST313 infections and isolates are most commonly recovered from blood, rather than from stool. This is consistent with observations in animals, in which ST313 strains displayed lower levels of intestinal colonization and higher recovery from deeper tissues relative to classic NTS isolates. A better understanding of the key environmental factors regulating these systemic infections is urgently needed. Our previous studies using dynamic Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology demonstrated that physiological levels of fluid shear regulate virulence, gene expression, and stress response profiles of classic S.

rotating_wall,9645892,Quantitative angiography of coronary artery dimensions 24 hours after rotational atherectomy.,"Rotational atherectomy results in platelet activation and heat generation, which may impact artery size immediately after treatment. In addition, arteries treated with balloon angioplasty may exhibit recoil within 24 hours. In this study, arteries treated with rotational atherectomy, with and without adjunctive balloon angioplasty, were analyzed by quantitative coronary angiography to determine the effect of rotational atherectomy on the dynamic behavior of the arterial wall within 24 hours after the procedure. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed at a core laboratory. Coronary angiogram acquisitions were preceded by intracoronary nitroglycerin injections and were repeated using identical angles of projection. Proximal and distal reference vessel diameters were 2.55 +/- 0.60 and 2.28 +/- 0.51 mm, respectively, and did not change from pre- to postprocedure. Both were larger the following day increasing to 2.72 +/- 0.65 and 2.52 +/- 0.52 mm, respectively, (p <0.001). Minimum luminal diameter (MLD) increased from 0.70 +/- 0.28 mm before to 1.49 +/- 0.34 mm after the procedure and to 1.72 +/- 0.37 mm at 24-hour follow-up (p <0.001). Subset analysis of patients treated with rotational atherectomy alone or rotational atherectomy with adjunctive balloon angioplasty revealed that the increase in luminal diameters occurred in both subsets. Patients treated with adjunctive angioplasty had a smaller initial MLD, a larger postprocedure MLD, and no difference in MLD at 24-hour follow-up compared with stand-alone rotational atherectomy. Subset analysis of 100 patients who had 6-month follow-up angiography revealed that both a calculated acute gain and chronic late loss, based on a 24-hour film, differed significantly from values using a film acquired immediately after the procedure. However, the slope of the linear regression between acute gain and chronic late loss did not differ. Coronary arteries treated with rotational atherectomy with or without adjunctive balloon angioplasty increase significantly in size during the first 24 hours after the procedure. This phenomenon has implications for the calculation of absolute gain and chronic late loss, but not for the linear relation between the 2 quantitative outcomes.",Reisman M; Buchbinder M; Harms V; McDaniel M; Peterson KL,,1998,The American journal of cardiology,"Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

A formula for the torque acting upon a rotating venting door is derived under conditions of vent cover jet formation. The vent cover jet effect decreases the torque three times compared to an elementary approach valid at the start of vent cover movement.

The probe has been installed in the outer midplane of the ASDEX Upgrade vessel, where ELM filaments are expected to have their maximum amplitude. Filaments are coherent substructures within an ELM, carrying a fraction of the ELM released energy towards the wall. The new probe allows to measure the structure of these filaments, in particular, parameters such as filament rotation (by time delay measurements) and size (by peak width analysis).

rotating_wall,6411023,[Myocardium-cardiac jelly dissociation and conal torsion. A study on the chick embryo heart].,"Conal twisting seems to result from dissociation between the cardiac jelly and the deep myocardial interface like the lining in the sleeve of a jacket. The conal ridges are the natural markers of the jelly and endocardium. They are responsible for septation of the conus and enable the twisting to be observed and measured. The myocardium is marked artificially by cauterisation. This marks the armature of the wall and leaves behind a zone of reduced resistance in the form of a hernia or false diverticulum. The conal ridges and marked myocardium dissociate. In the mid segment the myocardium does not play any role in twisting. In the proximal and distal segments it is only partially involved. This dissociation is observed even in the structure of the conal wall; the jelly, which is dense near the endocardium, is loose near the myocardium and adheres to the deep surface by dispersed fibres. Perfusion under pressure of the investigated specimens induces a detachment between the jelly and the myocardium and there only. This fragility only lasts during the twisting period. It is not found at the end of cardiac embryogenesis. This zone would allow not only a sliding--due to its fragility--but also a controlled sliding--by its fibres. In addition to twisting there is also conal migration. This takes place in the same direction as proximal twisting and determines myocardial rotation, which is less marked however, than that of the corresponding ridges. Experimentation may exaggerate this dissociation by preventing migration. It may also reduce or even suppress it by the formation of adhesions between the two layers. Although this mechanism is not univocal, a myocardial-jelly adhesion could stop distal twisting for example and explain malposition or transposition of the great vessels. This dissociation is no unique to superior vertebrates as it has also been found in the first living animals in whom conal twisting occurs, the dipneustes.",Dor X; Corone P,,1983,Archives des maladies du coeur et des vaisseaux,English Abstract; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,34126186,Optical Coherence Tomography for Neurovascular Disorders.,"Diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease includes vascular neuroimaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) angiography, magnetic resonance (MR) angiography (with or without use of contrast agents) and catheter digital subtraction angiography (DSA). These techniques provide mostly information about the vessel lumen. Vessel wall imaging with MR seeks to characterize cerebrovascular pathology, but with resolution that is often insufficient for small lesions. Intravascular imaging techniques such as ultrasound and optical coherence tomography (OCT), used for over a decade in the peripheral circulation, is not amendable to routine deployment in the intracranial circulation due to vessel caliber and tortuosity. However, advances in OCT technology including the probe profile, stiffness and unique distal rotation solution, holds the promise for eventual translation of OCT into the clinical arena. As such, it is apropos to review this technology and present the rationale for utilization of OCT in the cerebrovasculature.",Anagnostakou V; Ughi GJ; Puri AS; Gounis MJ,angiography; cerebrovascular disease; intracranial aneurysm; intracranial atherosclerosis; optical coherence tomography,2021,Neuroscience,Journal Article; Review,,

This prospective, single-center, observational study included 55 consecutive patients who underwent OFDI-guided RA. On pre-RA OFDI images, a circle, identical to the Rota burr was drawn at the center of the OFDI catheter (OFDI catheter-based prediction method) or wire (wire-based prediction method). The area overlapping the vessel wall was defined as the predicted ablation area (P-area). The actual ablated area (A-area) was measured by superimposing the OFDI images before and after RA. The overlapping P-area and A-area were defined as overlapped ablation area (O-area), and the predictive accuracy was evaluated by %Correct area (O-area/P-area) and %Error area (A-area  - O-area/A-area). The median %Correct and %Error areas were 47.8% and 41.6%, respectively. Irrelevant ablation (low %Correct-/high % Error areas) and over ablation (high %Correct-/high % Error areas) were related to deep vessel injury and intimal flap outside the P-area. The predictive accuracy was better in the OFDI catheter-based prediction method than the wire-based prediction method in the cross sections where the OFDI catheter and wire came in contact. However, it was better in the latter than the former where the OFDI catheter and wire were not in contact. OFDI-based simulation of the RA effect is feasible though accuracy may be affected by the OFDI catheter and wire position. OFDI-based simulation of RA effect might reduce peri-procedural complications during RA.",Hamana T; Kawamori H; Toba T; Nishimori M; Tanimura K; Kakizaki S; Nakamura K; Fujimoto D; Sasaki S; Osumi Y; Fujii M; Iwane S; Yamamoto T; Naniwa S; Sakamoto Y; Fukuishi Y; Matsuhama K; Hirata KI; Otake H,Optical frequency domain imaging; Percutaneous coronary intervention; Prediction; Prospective study; Rotational atherectomy,2023,Cardiovascular intervention and therapeutics,Journal Article; Observational Study,,
rotating_wall,34024939,"The effect of Dean, Reynolds, and Womersley number on the flow in a spherical cavity on a curved round pipe. Part 1. Fluid mechanics in the cavity as a canonical flow representing intracranial aneurysms.","Flow in side-wall cerebral aneurysms can be ideally modelled as the combination of flow over a spherical cavity and flow in a curved circular pipe, two canonical flows. Flow in a curved pipe is known to depend on the Dean number De, combining the effects of Reynolds number, Re, and of the curvature along the pipe centreline, κ. Pulsatility in the flow introduces a dependency on the Womersley number Wo. Using stereo PIV measurements, this study investigated the effect of these three key non-dimensional parameters, by modifying pipe curvature (De), flow-rate (Re), and pulsatility frequency (Wo), on the flow patterns in a spherical cavity. A single counter-rotating vortex was observed in the cavity for all values of pipe curvature κ and Re, for both steady and pulsatile inflow conditions. Increasing the pipe curvature impacted both the flow patterns in the pipe and the cavity, by shifting the velocity profile towards the cavity opening and increasing the flow rate into the cavity. The circulation in the cavity was found to collapse well with only the Dean number, for both steady and pulsatile inflows. For pulsatile inflow, the counter-rotating vortex was unstable and the location of its centre over time was impacted by the curvature of the pipe, as well as the Re and the Wo in the freestream. The circulation in the cavity was higher for steady inflow than for the equivalent average Reynolds and Dean number pulsatile inflow, with very limited impact of the Womersley in the range studied.",Chassagne F; Barbour MC; Chivukula VK; Machicoane N; Kim LJ; Levitt MR; Aliseda A,Cavity Flow; Cerebral Aneurysm; Dean Number; Flow in Curved Vessels; Hemodynamics; Reynolds Number; Womersely Number,2021,Journal of fluid mechanics,Journal Article,18CDA34110295/AHA/American Heart Association-American Stroke Association/United; R01 NS088072/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States; R01 NS105692/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States; R03 NS078539/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,30469384,"Synergistic Effects of Weightlessness, Isoproterenol, and Radiation on DNA Damage Response and Cytokine Production in Immune Cells.","The implementation of rotating-wall vessels (RWVs) for studying the effect of lack of gravity has attracted attention, especially in the fields of stem cells, tissue regeneration, and cancer research. Immune cells incubated in RWVs exhibit several features of immunosuppression including impaired leukocyte proliferation, cytokine responses, and antibody production. Interestingly, stress hormones influence cellular immune pathways affected by microgravity, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and T cell activation. These pathways are crucial defense mechanisms that protect the cell from toxins, pathogens, and radiation. Despite the importance of the adrenergic receptor in regulating the immune system, the effect of microgravity on the adrenergic system has been poorly studied. Thus, we elected to investigate the synergistic effects of isoproterenol (a sympathomimetic drug), radiation, and microgravity in nonstimulated immune cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with the sympathomimetic drug isoproterenol, exposed to 0.8 or 2 Gy γ-radiation, and incubated in RWVs. Mixed model regression analyses showed significant synergistic effects on the expression of the β2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2). Radiation alone increased ADRB2 expression, and cells incubated in microgravity had more DNA strand breaks than cells incubated in normal gravity. We observed radiation-induced cytokine production only in microgravity. Prior treatment with isoproterenol clearly prevents most of the microgravity-mediated effects. RWVs may be a useful tool to provide insight into novel regulatory pathways, providing benefit not only to astronauts but also to patients suffering from immune disorders or undergoing radiotherapy.",Moreno-Villanueva M; Feiveson AH; Krieger S; Kay Brinda A; von Scheven G; Bürkle A; Crucian B; Wu H,DNA damage response; adrenergic receptor; cytokines; radiation; simulated microgravity,2018,International journal of molecular sciences,Journal Article,MO 2243-2-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/; VRA 3-30-2015/NASA Space Biology Program/,
rotating_wall,16371429,Functional recovery of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in modeled microgravity.,"Immune function is suppressed in space flight, demonstrated by reduced mitogen-stimulated proliferation of postflight astronaut peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). While flight studies are limited, the development of rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors, such as the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV), has facilitated ground-based studies of the effects of modeled microgravity (MMG) on cell-mediated immunity. Astronauts regain immune function 3 days postflight, but this recovery has not yet been demonstrated following MMG. MMG eliminated phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated proliferation of PBMCs. Upon removal from HARV, full recovery was gradually achieved over a 72 h period, in agreement with postflight studies of astronauts. Recovery from MMG delayed, but did not reduce, the maximal proliferative response compared with PHA-activated stationary cultures. Likewise, peak expression of T cell surface activation markers CD69 and CD25 was delayed upon stimulation following exposure to MMG. MMG and recovery from MMG differentially affected the detection of IL-2 and IFN in supernatants. Further development of this model of immune recovery is important for investigating the mechanisms of immune suppression and recovery in space flight, as well as possible countermeasures to prevent immunosuppression or enhance recovery. Given the analogous immune suppression observed in microgravity, MMG, and aging, further investigation may also lead to advances in anti-aging medicine.",Ritz BW; Lelkes PI; Gardner EM,,2006,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,29340993,Laparoscopic-Assisted Modified Intersphincter Resection for Ultralow Rectal Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Intersphincter resection (ISR) is considered to be a superior technique offering sphincter preservation in patients with ultralow rectal cancer.1 Because high-definition laparoscopy offers wider and clearer vision into the narrow pelvic cavity and intersphincteric space, ISR has been further refined.2 However, functional outcome after ISR has not been optimal. More than half of patients receiving ISR suffer partial or even complete anal incontinence.3 We therefore propose a laparoscopic-assisted modified ISR, with the aim of improving sphincter function following ISR. METHODS: The video describes the technique for performing such laparoscopic-assisted modified ISR in a 62-year-old woman with ultralow rectal cancer (3 cm from anal verge). Preoperative staging by endorectal ultrasound and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging revealed stage I rectal cancer (cT(2)N(0)M(0)). The operation consisted of an abdominal and a perineal phase. The abdominal phase routinely involved colonic mobilization with high ligation of inferior mesenteric vessels, total mesorectal excision (TME), as well as transabdominal intersphincteric dissection. The procedure for laparoscopic TME was performed according to our published method.4 Along the TME dissection plane, the puborectalis could be reached and the intersphincteric space was entered posterolaterally. The hiatal ligament at the posterior side of the rectum was transected afterwards. The dissection of the intersphincteric space was continued caudally at the anterior side of the rectum. The distal bowel wall was mobilized for 2 cm from the lower edge of the tumor to obtain adequate distal margin. At this point, circular dissection of the intersphincteric space was completed. After the abdominal phase, perineal dissection was performed with wide exposure by use of a hooked self-retaining retractor. The lower margin of the tumor was identified under direct vision. We developed a modified ISR technique. Resection of the mucosa and internal sphincter was initiated 2 cm distal to the lower edge of the tumor at the tumor side to obtain the necessary distal margin. Meanwhile, at the opposite side of the tumor, the resection line was just above the dentate line so that partial dentate line could be preserved. After removal of the specimen en bloc per anus, the pelvic cavity was generously irrigated with diluted povidone iodine solutions. The distal margin of the specimen was then examined by frozen section for presence of cancer. If clear, coloanal anastomosis was performed using a handsewn technique. The colon was rotated 90° and anastomosed to the anal canal with interrupted absorbable 3-0 sutures. Finally, a pelvic suction drain was placed, and a temporary diverting stoma made in the terminal ileum. RESULTS: There were no intraoperative complications. The operating time was 180 min. Blood loss was 50 mL. The distal margin was clear, and the final pathology was pT(2)N(0)M(0). The patient underwent an uneventful recovery. She began sphincter-strengthening exercises 2 weeks after surgery. The stoma was closed after examinations 3 months later. No local recurrence or distant metastasis was found. At 12-month follow-up, in terms of sphincteric function, the patient was continent to solids, liquids, and flatus. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic-assisted modified intersphincter resection for ultralow rectal cancer is safe and feasible. This technique should be considered whenever possible as a means to offer sphincter preservation and improve sphincter function in patients with ultralow rectal cancer.",Zhou H; Ruan C; Wang Z; Hu Z,,2018,Annals of surgical oncology,Journal Article,81571827/National Natural Science Foundation of China/; 2017YQ006/Shanghai Excellent Young Medical Talents Program/; 17QA1405600/Shanghai Rising-Star Program/,

rotating_wall,1170827,Influence of concanavalin a on autolysis of gametes from Chlamydomonas reinhardii.,"The phytohemagglutinin concanavalin A inhibited zygote formation of Chlamydomonas reinhardii. 15--50 mug lectin/ml not only interfered with the mating reaction, but also with cell wall lysis of gametes and zoospores in a crude autolysin preparation gained from copulating gametes. Further, the structure of cell walls shed into the medium after autolysis in the course of the mating reaction and after lysis ""from without"" in the crude autolysin preparation was stabilized by Con A. Therefore, it must be assumed that the lectin inhibited zygote formation of C. reinhardii by interfering with autolysis of the cell walls of the gametes. Though Con A inhibited the lytic processes of C. reinhardii, an activation of the autolytic system in theta gametes by the lectin was found to compete with its inhibitory reaction. Con A induced autolysis of theta gametes was dependent on adherence of the cells by their flagella to the surface of the culture vessel or the liquid medium and did not occur in cultures stirred by rotation. The interferences of Con A with the autolytic serum of C. rienhardii were inhibited by methyl-alpha-D-mannopyrano-side and to a lesser degree by glucose, indicating that the carbohydrate binding sites of the lectin were involved in its reactions with the cells.",Claes H,,1975,Archives of microbiology,Journal Article,,

We have previously shown that Sertoli cells (SC) provide neurotrophic support to transplants of dopaminergic fetal neurons and NT2N neurons, derived from the human clonal precursors cell line NTera2/D1 (NT2), which differentiate into dopaminergic NT2N neurons when exposed to retinoic acid. We have created SC-NT2 cell tissue constructs cultured in the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) rotating wall bioreactor. Sertoli cells, NT2, and SC plus NT2 cells combined in starting ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8 were cultured in the HARV in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% growth factor reduced Matrigel for 3 days, without retinoic acid. Conventional, non-HARV, cultures grown in the same culture medium were used as controls. The presence of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was assessed in all culture conditions. Sertoli-neuron-aggregated-cell (SNAC) tissue constructs grown at starting ratios of 1:1 to 1:4 contained a significant amount of TH after 3 days of culture in the HARV. No TH was detected in SC HARV cultures, or SC, NT2 or SC-NT2 conventional co-cultures. Quantitative stereology of immunolabled 1:4 SNAC revealed that approximately 9% of NT2 cells differentiate into TH-positive (TH+) NT2N neurons after 3 days of culture in the HARV, without retinoic acid. SNAC tissue constructs also released dopamine (DA) when stimulated with KCl, suggesting that TH-positive NT2N neurons in the SNAC adopted a functional dopaminergic phenotype. SNAC tissue constructs may be an important source of dopaminergic neurons for neuronal transplantation.",Saporta S; Willing AE; Shamekh R; Bickford P; Paredes D; Cameron DF,NASA Discipline Cell Biotechnology; Non-NASA Center,2004,Brain research bulletin,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,

We cultured human endothelial cells in a dedicated centrifuge (MidiCAR) to generate hypergravity and in two different devices, namely the Rotating Wall Vessel and the Random Positioning Machine, to generate hypogravity. Hypogravity stimulated endothelial growth, did not affect migration, and enhanced nitric oxide production. It also remodeled the actin cytoskeleton and reduced the total amounts of actin. Hypergravity did not affect endothelial growth, markedly stimulated migration, and enhanced nitric oxide synthesis. In addition, hypergravity altered the distribution of actin fibers without, however, affecting the total amounts of actin. A short exposure to hypergravity (8 min) abolished the hypogravity induced growth advantage. Our results indicate that cytoskeletal alterations and increased nitric oxide production represent common denominators in endothelial responses to both hypogravity and hypergravity.",Versari S; Villa A; Bradamante S; Maier JA,,2007,Biochimica et biophysica acta,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,23504615,Automated Detection of Contractile Abnormalities from Stress-Rest Motion Changes.,"Changes in myocardial function signatures such as wall motion and thickening are typically computed separately from myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) stress and rest studies to assess for stress-induced function abnormalities. The standard approach may suffer from the variability in contour placements and image orientation when subtle changes between stress and rest scans in motion and thickening are being evaluated. We have developed a new measure of regional change of function signature (motion and thickening) computed directly from registered stress and rest gated MPS data. In our novel approach, endocardial surfaces at the end-diastolic and end-systolic frames for stress and rest studies were registered by matching ventricular surfaces. Furthermore, we propose a new global registration method based on finding the optimal rotation for myocardial best ellipsoid fit to minimize the indexing disparities between two surfaces between stress and rest studies. Myocardial stress-rest function changes were computed and normal limits of change were determined as the mean and standard deviation of the training set for each polar sample. Normal limits were utilized to quantify the stress-rest function change for each polar map sample and the accumulated quantified function signature values were used for abnormality assessments in territorial regions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our novel method, we examined the agreements of our results against visual scores for motion change on vessel territorial regions obtained by human experts on a test group with 623 cases and were able to show that our detection method has a improved sensitivity on per vessel territory basis, compared to those obtained by human experts utilizing gated MPS data.",Karimi-Ashtiani S; Arsanjani R; Fish M; Berman D; Kavanagh1 P; Germano G; Slomka P,Coronary artery disease; Gated study; Regional wall motion; SPECT,2012,Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering,Journal Article,R01 HL089765/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,

Although weightlessness is known to alter several cellular functions and to affect signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation and death, its influence on cellular radiosensitivity has so far proven elusive. Renewed controversy as to whether reduced gravity enhances long-term radiation risk is fueled by recently published data that claim either overall enhancement of genomic damage or no increase of radiation-induced clastogenicity by modeled microgravity in irradiated human cells. In elucidating this crucial aspect of space radiation protection, ground-based experiments, such as those based on rotating-wall bioreactors, will increasingly be used and represent a more reproducible alternative to in-flight experiments. These low-shear vessels also make three-dimensional cellular co-cultures possible and thus allow to study the gravisensitivity of radioresponse in a context that better mimics cell-to-cell communication and hence in vivo cellular behavior.",Manti L,,2006,Radiation and environmental biophysics,Journal Article; Review,,

This work examines the effects of HARV cultivation on DU 145 human prostate carcinoma cells. In the HARV, these prostate cells grew in suspension on Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads to form bead aggregates with extensive three-dimensional growth between beads and on the aggregate surface. HARV and spinner-flask control cultures of DU 145 cells had similar doubling times, but the former was characterized by a higher percentage of G(1)-phase cells, larger bead aggregates, enhanced development of filopodia and microvilli-like structures on the aggregate surface, and stronger staining for select cytoskeletal proteins (cytokeratins 8 and 18, actin, and vimentin). When compared with static controls grown in a T-flask and Transwell insert, HARV cultures grew more slowly and differences in the cell cycle and immunostaining became more pronounced. These results suggest that HARV cultivation produced a culture that was less aggressive from the perspective of proliferation, more differentiated and less pliant than any of the three control cultures examined in this work. Possible factors effecting this change are discussed including turbulence and three-dimensional growth.",Clejan S; O'Connor KC; Cowger NL; Cheles MK; Haque S; Primavera AC,,1996,Biotechnology and bioengineering,Journal Article,,

To investigate these potential effects in a more affordable experimental setup, three ground-based microgravity simulators were tested: the Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV), the Random Positioning Machine (RPM), and a superconducting magnet. The bacterial conjugative system consisted in biparental matings between two B. thuringiensis strains, where the transfer frequencies of the conjugative plasmid pAW63 and its ability to mobilize the nonconjugative plasmid pUB110 were assessed. Specifically, potential plasmid transfers in a 0 g position (simulated microgravity) were compared to those obtained under 1 g (normal gravity) condition in each device. Statistical analyses revealed no significant difference in the conjugative and mobilizable transfer frequencies between the three different simulated microgravitational conditions and our standard laboratory condition. These important ground-based observations emphasize the fact that, though no stimulation of plasmid transfer was observed, no inhibition was observed either. In the case of Gram-positive bacteria, this ability to exchange plasmids in weightlessness, as occurs under Earth's conditions, should be seen as particularly relevant in the scope of spread of antibiotic resistances and bacterial virulence.",Beuls E; Van Houdt R; Leys N; Dijkstra C; Larkin O; Mahillon J,,2009,Astrobiology,Journal Article,,

rotating_wall,15653234,On the potential of the Lagrangian speckle model estimator to characterize atherosclerotic plaques in endovascular elastography: in vitro experiments using an excised human carotid artery.,"Endovascular ultrasound (US) elastography (EVE) was introduced to supplement endovascular US echograms in the assessment of vessel lesions and for endovascular therapy planning. Indeed, changes in the vascular tissue stiffness are characteristic of vessel wall pathologies and EVE appears as a very appropriate imaging technique to outline the elastic properties of vessel walls. Recently, a model-based approach was proposed to assess tissue motion in EVE. It specifically consists of a nonlinear minimization algorithm that was adapted to speckle motion estimation. Regarding the theoretical framework, such an approach considers the speckle as a material property; this assumption then led to the derivation of the optical flow equations, which were suitably combined with the Lagrangian speckle model estimator to provide the full 2-D polar strain tensor. In this study, the proposed algorithm was validated in vitro using a fresh excised human carotid artery. The experimental setup consisted of a cardiovascular imaging system (CVIS) US scanner, working with a 30-MHz mechanical rotating single-element transducer, a digital oscilloscope and a pressuring system. A sequence of radiofrequency (RF) images was collected while incrementally adjusting the intraluminal static pressure steps. The results showed the potential of this 2-D algorithm to characterize and to distinguish an atherosclerotic plaque from the normal vascular tissue. Namely, the geometry as well as some mechanical characteristics of the detected plaque were in good agreement with histology. The results also suggested that there might exist a range of intraluminal pressures for which plaque detectability is optimal.",Maurice RL; Brusseau E; Finet G; Cloutier G,,2005,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

The principal aim of this review is to highlight the advances and accomplishments in the field of tissue engineering that could be achieved by culturing cells in Space or by devices created to simulate microgravity on Earth. Understanding the biology of three-dimensional (3D) multicellular structures is very important for a more complete appreciation of in vivo tissue function and advancing in vitro tissue engineering efforts. Various cells exposed to r-μg in Space or to s-μg created by a random positioning machine, a 2D-clinostat, or a rotating wall vessel bioreactor grew in the form of 3D tissues. Hence, these methods represent a new strategy for tissue engineering of a variety of tissues, such as regenerated cartilage, artificial vessel constructs, and other organ tissues as well as multicellular cancer spheroids. These aggregates are used to study molecular mechanisms involved in angiogenesis, cancer development, and biology and for pharmacological testing of, for example, chemotherapeutic drugs or inhibitors of neoangiogenesis. Moreover, they are useful for studying multicellular responses in toxicology and radiation biology, or for performing coculture experiments. The future will show whether these tissue-engineered constructs can be used for medical transplantations.

rotating_wall,28720200,Influence of erythrocyte aggregation on radial migration of platelet-sized spherical particles in shear flow.,"Blood platelets when activated are involved in the mechanisms of hemostasis and thrombosis, and their migration toward injured vascular endothelium necessitates interaction with red blood cells (RBCs). Rheology co-factors such as a high hematocrit and a high shear rate are known to promote platelet mass transport toward the vessel wall. Hemodynamic conditions promoting RBC aggregation may also favor platelet migration, particularly in the venous system at low shear rates. The aim of this study was to confirm experimentally the impact of RBC aggregation on platelet-sized micro particle migration in a Couette flow apparatus. Biotin coated micro particles were mixed with saline or blood with different aggregation tendencies, at two shear rates of 2 and 10s(-1) and three hematocrits ranging from 20 to 60%. Streptavidin membranes were respectively positioned on the Couette static and rotating cylinders upon which the number of adhered fluorescent particles was quantified. The platelet-sized particle adhesion on both walls was progressively enhanced by increasing the hematocrit (p<0.001), reducing the shear rate (p<0.001), and rising the aggregation of RBCs (p<0.001). Particle count was minimum on the stationary cylinder when suspended in saline at 2s(-1) (57±33), and maximum on the rotating cylinder at 60% hematocrit, 2s(-1) and the maximum dextran-induced RBC aggregation (2840±152).

rotating_wall,19355813,A novel buoyancy technique optimizes simulated microgravity conditions for whole sensory organ culture in rotating bioreactors.,"Whole-organ culture of a sensory organ in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor provides a powerful in vitro model for physiological and pathophysiological investigation as previously demonstrated for the postnatal inner ear. The model is of specific relevance as a tool for regeneration research. In the immature inner ear explant, the density was only 1.29 g/cm(3). The high density of 1.68 g/cm(3) of the functionally mature organ resulted in enhanced settling velocity and deviation from its ideal circular orbital path causing enhanced shear stress. The morphometric and physical properties, as well as the dynamic motion patterns of explants, were analyzed and numerically evaluated by an orbital path index. Application of a novel buoyancy bead technique resulted in a 6.5- to 14.8-fold reduction of the settling velocity. The deviation of the explant from its ideal circular orbital path was adjusted as indicated by an optimum value for the orbital path index (-1.0). Shear stress exerted on the inner ear explant was consequently reduced 6.4- to 15.0-fold. The culture conditions for postnatal stages were optimized, and the preconditions for transferring this in vitro model toward mature high-density stages established. This buoyancy technique may also be useful in tissue engineering of other high-density structures.",Arnold HJ; Müller M; Waldhaus J; Hahn H; Löwenheim H,,2010,"Tissue engineering.

We present a lesion-based computational fluid dynamic (CFD) pilot analysis to understand the complex spatial and temporal hemodynamic changes that prevail in patients with high-grade carotid artery stenosis (CS). High-resolution three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography datasets were acquired in eight patients, and used to generate computational meshes. CFD analysis was carried out implementing realistic shear-dependent viscosity for blood. The mean wall shear stress (WSS) within the stenosis region was 107 ± 73 dyn/cm(2) rapidly followed by direction reversal and lower oscillating values in the recirculation zone at a mean of 19 ± 14 dyn/cm(2). WSS vectors exhibited complex dynamic directional and amplitude oscillations not seen in healthy segments, along with time-dependent convergence and divergence strips during the cardiac cycle. The spatial gradient of WSS revealed an elevated average magnitude at the throat of the stenosis of 1425 ± 1012 dyn/cm(3). In conclusion, patient-based CFD analysis of CS predicts a complex hemodynamic environment with large spatial WSS variations that occur very rapidly over short distances. Our results improve estimates of the flow changes and forces at the vessel wall in CS and the link between hemodynamic changes and stenosis pathophysiology.",Schirmer CM; Malek AM,Atherosclerosis; Carotid artery; Endothelium; Fluid mechanics; Stenosis,2012,Brain and behavior,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,34568685,Effect of Baffle Clearance on Scale Deposition in an Agitated Vessel.,"The material deposition in a mixing tank agitated by the MAXBLEND impeller in a turbulent state was quantified and compared between cases with and without baffle clearance. Magnesium hydroxide formed from the chemical reaction between calcium hydroxide and magnesium chloride was used as a model of scale formation. Flow velocity in the tank was investigated by employing computational fluid dynamics simulation and experimentally validated by an ultrasonic velocity profiler method. Results showed that the amount of scale decreased with the increase in the rotational speed of the impeller due to the erosion effect on the tank wall. In the case without baffle clearance, the smaller weight of the scale was deposited on the front of the baffle plate due to the flow impingement, which enhanced the removal of the scale deposition. However, the lower-velocity magnitude behind the baffles resulted in an enhancement in the formation of scale. Installation of baffle clearance caused a contraction flow in between the tank wall and baffles, and consequently, the higher flow velocity reduced the amount and thickness of the scale. Measurement of the torque showed that the baffle clearance did not affect the power consumption, so the installation of baffle clearance can be a promising approach to reduce scale deposition in terms of saving operational costs and increasing process efficiency and safety.",Sato E; Ochi Y; Horiguchi H; Takenaka K; Wu J; Parthasarathy R; Komoda Y; Ohmura N,,2021,ACS omega,Journal Article,,

This rotation places the colon in the right half of the abdominal cavity and the small intestine in the left half of the abdominal cavity. We report the case of a 19-year-old patient with a history of cerebral palsy secondary to meningitis who presented with melaena and inflammatory anaemia. CT enterography was performed which showed regular, non-stenosing circumferential wall thickening of the sigmoid colon and rectosigmoid junction compatible with Crohn's disease, which was confirmed by pathophysiology. It also revealed transposition of the colon to the right hemi-abdomen and the small intestine to the left hemi-abdomen, the caecum to the right iliac fossa, and the third portion of the duodenum to the left of the mesenteric vessels.

rotating_wall,24786000,Margination of micro- and nano-particles in blood flow and its effect on drug delivery.,"Drug delivery by micro- and nano-carriers enables controlled transport of pharmaceuticals to targeted sites. Even though carrier fabrication has made much progress recently, the delivery including controlled particle distribution and adhesion within the body remains a great challenge. The adhesion of carriers is strongly affected by their margination properties (migration toward walls) in the microvasculature. To investigate margination characteristics of carriers of different shapes and sizes and to elucidate the relevant physical mechanisms, we employ mesoscopic hydrodynamic simulations of blood flow. Particle margination is studied for a wide range of hematocrit values, vessel sizes, and flow rates, using two- and three-dimensional models. The simulations show that the margination properties of particles improve with increasing carrier size. Spherical particles yield slightly better margination than ellipsoidal carriers; however, ellipsoidal particles exhibit a slower rotational dynamics near a wall favoring their adhesion. In conclusion, micron-sized ellipsoidal particles are favorable for drug delivery in comparison with sub-micron spherical particles.",Müller K; Fedosov DA; Gompper G,,2014,Scientific reports,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,10190434,A new extended external oblique musculocutaneous flap for reconstruction of large chest-wall defects.,"A new extended external oblique musculocutaneous flap utilized in the reconstruction of chest-wall defects is described. The flap is drawn as a V-Y rotation flap on the ipsilateral abdominal wall. It is laterally based, and its pedicle coincides with the five lowest costal insertions of the external oblique. The flap extends above the transiliac line, from the posterior axillary line to the linea alba, and includes the dynamic territory of the external oblique muscle. Vascular supply is provided by the musculocutaneous perforating arteries of the intercostal vessels and their subcutaneous branches. The flap is raised medially and includes the anterior sheath of the rectus. Undermining continues between the external and the internal oblique muscles as far as the posterior axillary line. The donor site on the abdominal wall is reinforced by the plication of the internal oblique sheath. This flap was used in 13 patients with major anterior chest-wall excisional defects. The mean chest-wall defect was about 390 cm2. Marginal necrosis with distal skin loss was observed in one patient. All other flaps healed without complications. The extended external oblique musculocutaneous flap differs from other external oblique flaps already described in several aspects that allow it to obtain better functional and aesthetic results.",Moschella F; Cordova A,,1999,Plastic and reconstructive surgery,Journal Article,,

METHODS: Patient-specific models of 4 cerebral aneurysms (1 posterior communicating artery [PcomA], 2 middle cerebral artery [MCA], and 1 anterior communicating artery [AcomA]) were constructed from 3D rotational angiography images. Two geometric models were constructed for each aneurysm. One model had the native parent vessel geometry; the second model was truncated approximately 1 cm upstream from the aneurysm, and the parent artery replaced with a straight cylinder. Corresponding finite element grids were generated and computational fluid dynamics simulations were carried out under pulsatile flow conditions. The intra-aneurysmal flow patterns and wall shear stress (WSS) distributions were visualized and compared. RESULTS: Models using the truncated parent vessel underestimated the WSS in the aneurysms in all cases and shifted the impaction zone to the neck compared with the native geometry. These effects were more pronounced in the PcomA and AcomA aneurysms where upstream curvature was substantial. The MCA aneurysm with a long M1 segment was the least effected. The more laminar flow pattern within the parent vessel in truncated models resulted in a less complex intra-aneurysmal flow patterns with fewer vortices and less velocity at the dome. CONCLUSIONS: Failure to properly model the inflow stream contributed by the upstream parent artery can significantly influence the results of intra-aneurysmal hemodynamic models. The upstream portion of the parent vessel of cerebral aneurysms should be included to accurately represent the intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics.",Castro MA; Putman CM; Cebral JR,,2006,AJNR.

However, these in vitro conditions vary quite drastically from the tissues that are commonly infected in vivo. Over the years, a number of systems have been developed that allow the establishment of three-dimensional (3D) tissue structures that have properties similar to their in vivo 3D counterparts. These 3D systems have numerous applications including drug testing, maintenance of large tissue explants, monitoring migration of human lymphocytes in tissues, analysis of human organ tissue development and investigation of virus-host interactions including viral latency. Here, we describe the establishment of tissue-like assemblies for human lung and neuronal tissue that we infected with a variety of viruses including the respiratory pathogens human parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and SARS corona virus (SARS-CoV) as well as the human neurotropic herpesvirus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV).",Goodwin TJ; McCarthy M; Cohrs RJ; Kaufer BB,3D tissue culture systems; Latency; Rotating-wall vessel bioreactor; Tissue-like assemblies (TLA); Varicella-zoster virus,2015,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)","Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",P01 AG032958/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States; R01 NS082228/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States; AG032958/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States; NS082228/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States,

To investigate the role of microgravity on innate immune function, we evaluated NK and LAK activity of human PBMC stimulated with IL-2 under conditions of simulated microgravity, by using a rotating wall vessel (RWV) culture system. Under these conditions, both NK and LAK activity were generated at levels comparable to those found in static flask cultures. The phenotype of the activated PBMC was similar between the two culture conditions, with one notable exception: the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25), which failed to be upregulated in simulated microgravity. To further investigate this change in IL-2 signaling, we examined the ability of IL-2 to induce secondary cytokines. The production of IFNgamma, IL-1beta, and TNFalpha was almost completely abrogated in the microgravity cultures, suggesting that the IL-2 signaling pathways leading to various IL-2-mediated effects are differentially regulated under bioreactor culture conditions.",Licato LL; Grimm EA,,1999,Immunopharmacology,Journal Article,,

We describe a novel, less invasive approach for totally arterial CABG via a small left anterior thoracotomy in a pilot series of 20 unselected patients. From January to March 2020, 20 consecutive patients (mean age 65.9 ± 9.2 years, 100% male, STS-score: 1.6 ± 2) underwent CABG using only arterial conduits via a small left anterior thoracotomy. Patients were operated on cardiopulmonary bypass with peripheral cannulation and transthoracic aortic cross-clamping. Pulling tapes encircling the great vessels, the arrested empty heart was rotated and moved within the pericardium to enable conventional anastomotic techniques especially on lateral and inferior wall coronary targets. In all patients, left internal mammary artery and radial artery were utilized for bypass with 3.3 ± 0.7 distal coronary anastomoses per patient. Anterior, lateral, and inferior wall territories were revascularized in 100%, 85%, and 70% of patients, respectively. Complete anatomical revascularization was achieved in 95% of patients. ICU stay was 1 day in 17 patients, and 14 of patients left the hospital within 8 days. There was no hospital death, no stroke, no myocardial infarction, and no repeat revascularization. In this pilot series of 20 patients, minimally invasive, totally arterial CABG with avoidance of sternotomy was technically feasible with favorable patient outcomes.",Dörge H; Sellin C; Belmenai A; Asch S; Eggebrecht H; Schächinger V,CABG; Coronary artery bypass graft; Coronary bypass surgery; Minimally invasive surgery; TCRAT,2022,Heart and vessels,Journal Article,,

We tried a transgastric pure NOTES procedure without laparoscopic procedure in an animal study after placing an endoscopic naso-gallbladder drainage (ENGBD) tube and injecting a hyaluronic acid (HA) mixture. METHODS: We performed the method in four pigs, using a standard single-channel endoscope. The ENGBD tube was placed first and the HA mixture was injected between the gallbladder (GB) serosa and liver bed. RESULTS: We determined the gastrotomy site using an ENGBD tube, which made the GB approach easy under fluoroscopic guidance. The scope was not retroflexed, but was rotated at the stomach fornix. The connecting tissues between the GB serosa and liver bed expanded following the injection of the HA mixture, facilitating GB removal with a Hook knife. The GB wall, liver, and vessels were observed clearly during the procedure, and there were no incorrect cuts. CONCLUSION: We successfully performed a transgastric pure NOTES cholecystectomy in pigs. An ENGBD tube was useful as a guide to the GB, and for recognizing the cystic duct, and injecting the HA mixture facilitated the GB dissection.",Isayama H; Kogure H; Koike K,,2011,Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences,Journal Article,,

The present study reports on the evaluation of uniquely shaped filaments and diffuser blades in the development of a protective stent for an intravascular cavopulmonary assist device for patients with a single ventricle. METHODS: We performed numeric modeling, hydraulic testing of 11 stents with an axial flow blood pump, and blood bag experiments (n = 6) of the top-performing stent geometries to measure the levels of hemolysis. A direct comparison using statistical analyses, including regression analysis and analysis of variance, was completed. RESULTS: The stent geometry with straight filaments and diffuser blades that extended to the vessel wall outperformed all other stent configurations. The pump with this particular stent was able to generate pressures of 2 to 32 mm Hg for flow rates of 0.5 to 4 L/min at 5000 to 7000 RPM. A comparison of the experimental performance data to the numeric predictions demonstrated an excellent agreement within 16%. The addition of diffuser blades to the stent reduced the flow vorticity at the pump outlet. The average and maximum normalized index of hemolysis level was 0.0056 g/100 L and 0.0064 g/100 L, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The specialized design of the stents, which protect the vessel wall from the rotating components of the pump, proved to be advantageous by further augmenting the pressure generation of the pump, reducing the flow vorticity at the pump outlet, and enhancing flow control.

rotating_wall,17466446,On the potential of the lagrangian estimator for endovascular ultrasound elastography: in vivo human coronary artery study.,"Diagnosis and prognosis of coronary artery atherosclerosis evolution currently rely on plaque morphology and vessel stenosis degree. Such information can accurately be assessed with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging. A severe complication of coronary artery atherosclerosis is thrombosis, a consequence of plaque rupture or fissure, which might lead to myocardial infarction and sudden ischemic death. Plaque rupture is a complicated mechanical process, correlated with the plaque morphology, composition, mechanical properties and with the blood pressure. Extracting information on the plaque local mechanical properties may reveal relevant features about plaque vulnerability. Accordingly, endovascular elastography (EVE) was introduced to complement IVUS for investigating coronary artery diseases. In this article, in vivo elastographic data are reported for three patients (patient 1, patient 2 and patient 3) who were diagnosed with severe coronary artery stenoses. Time-sequence radio-frequency (RF) data were acquired, in the minutes preceding angioplasty, using an ultrasound scanner working with a 30 MHz mechanical rotating single-element transducer. The elastograms of the radial strain and radial shear distributions within the vessel wall were computed from pairs of successive RF images using the Lagrangian estimator (LE). A hard atherosclerotic plaque (low radial strain and shear) was identified in patient 1. High radial strain and shear values in the plaque areas for patient 2 and patient 3 suggested the presence of lipid cores (soft materials), known to be prone-to-rupture sites when located close to the lumen. To conclude, EVE allowing radial strain and shear images is an improvement over existing EVE methods that may assist IVUS in preoperative vessel lesion assessments and in endovascular therapy planning.",Maurice RL; Fromageau J; Brusseau E; Finet G; Rioufol G; Cloutier G,,2007,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,8084226,MRI signal void due to in-plane motion is all-or-none.,"The process of MRI signal attenuation due to in-plane intravoxel velocity inhomogeneity is described. Given rigid rotation or linear shear, velocity phase-sensitivity will induce a phase distribution that varies linearly with position, which is exactly equivalent to the effect of a spatial phase encoding gradient pulse. It follows that the effect of such motion on the raw MRI signal is to displace it a fixed distance in kappa-space. Attenuation becomes marked when the center of the spin-echo reaches an edge of kappa-space, which happens when intravoxel phase shifts reach pi radian/voxel. Because spin echoes are typically peaked sharply at center, this attenuation usually is abrupt. Analytic and numerical simulations of linear and nonlinear velocity fields confirm abrupt MRI attenuation where phase dispersion exceeds pi radian/voxel. Examples of this phenomenon include the abrupt loss of blood signal adjacent the vessel wall in laminar flow, abrupt loss of subendocardial signal in early diastole, and sudden disappearance due to rotation of a kidney during a measurement of diffusion.",Wedeen VJ; Weisskoff RM; Poncelet BP,,1994,Magnetic resonance in medicine,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",HL-39371/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,

The giant form with a small abdominal wall defect is a rare condition which, to our knowledge, has not been described previously. We describe three cases with the typical features of elongated vascular liver pedicle and angiomatosis of the hepatic portal system. The abnormal liver organogenesis, due to extra-abdominal development, represented a significant risk factor for hepatic thrombosis after visceral reduction and liver rotation. All the neonates underwent surgery on the first day of postnatal life. One died because of a postoperative liver infarction, and the survivors needed prolonged respiratory support. Prenatal sonographic features, timing, delivery, type of surgical repair, and postnatal outcome are reviewed. A prenatal sonographic diagnosis could be useful to evaluate the abdominal ring and serial ultrasound examinations are recommended to detect promptly ominous signs of hepatic and bowel damage. Color Doppler may be useful to assess the anatomy of the abdominal vessels and their relationships with the herniated organs, although it was not used in any of the cases reported here.

In addition, two growth methods utilized tissue culture flasks (TCFs): a) unaltered or conventional TCFs; and b) poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) [poly(HEMA)] coated TCFs, to inhibit cell attachment. Comparisons were drawn based on qualitative observation of cell morphology and quantitative metabolic data. Similar cellular metabolism was demonstrated for cells grown under each condition. The degree of aggregation, however, varies considerably. Spherical shaped aggregates with diameters of 1 to 3 mm were produced when cells were grown within the perfusion-RWV bioreactor. All other growth conditions produced irregular shaped aggregates of various sizes. Quantitative results demonstrated the expected glucose utilization concomitant with lactate accumulation.

rotating_wall,22865935,A hybrid formalism combining fluctuating hydrodynamics and generalized Langevin dynamics for the simulation of nanoparticle thermal motion in an incompressible fluid medium.,"A novel hybrid scheme based on Markovian fluctuating hydrodynamics of the fluid and a non-Markovian Langevin dynamics with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise perturbing the translational and rotational equations of motion of the nanoparticle is employed to study the thermal motion of a nanoparticle in an incompressible Newtonian fluid medium. A direct numerical simulation adopting an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) based finite element method (FEM) is employed in simulating the thermal motion of a particle suspended in the fluid confined in a cylindrical vessel. The results for thermal equilibrium between the particle and the fluid are validated by comparing the numerically predicted temperature of the nanoparticle with that obtained from the equipartition theorem. The nature of the hydrodynamic interactions is verified by comparing the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) and mean squared displacement (MSD) with well-known analytical results. For nanoparticle motion in an incompressible fluid, the fluctuating hydrodynamics approach resolves the hydrodynamics correctly but does not impose the correct equipartition of energy based on the nanoparticle mass because of the added mass of the displaced fluid. In contrast, the Langevin approach with an appropriate memory is able to show the correct equipartition of energy, but not the correct short- and long-time hydrodynamic correlations. Using our hybrid approach presented here, we show for the first time, that we can simultaneously satisfy the equipartition theorem and the (short- and long-time) hydrodynamic correlations. In effect, this results in a thermostat that also simultaneously preserves the true hydrodynamic correlations. The significance of this result is that our new algorithm provides a robust computational approach to explore nanoparticle motion in arbitrary geometries and flow fields, while simultaneously enabling us to study carrier adhesion mediated by biological reactions (receptor-ligand interactions) at the vessel wall at a specified finite temperature.",Uma B; Eckmann DM; Ayyaswamy PS; Radhakrishnan R,,2012,Molecular physics,Journal Article,R01 EB006818/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States; R01 EB006818-04/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States,

We here demonstrate that mitophagy contributes to endothelial adaptation to gravitational unloading. After 4 and 10 d of exposure to simulated microgravity in the rotating wall vessel, the amount of BCL2 interacting protein 3, a marker of mitophagy, is increased and, in parallel, mitochondrial content, oxygen consumption, and maximal respiratory capacity are reduced, suggesting the acquisition of a thrifty phenotype to meet the novel metabolic challenges generated by gravitational unloading.

Thrombus removal was performed by 1) a Trac-Wright catheter; 2) an ultrasound-driven, oscillating probe aspiration thrombectomy (US-OAT) device; 3) an electric motor-driven oscillating probe aspiration thrombectomy (EM-OAT) device; and 4) a rotating spiral aspiration thrombectomy (RAT) device. All devices were able to restore a continuous lumen of the shunt model within 1-5 min, but residual layers of wall-adherent thrombi remained attached, particularly to the inner curvature of the shunt loop. Clot removal rate was 95% for the Trac-Wright catheter, 73% for the US-OAT device, 68% for the EM-OAT device (straight tip catheter), 88% for the EM-OAT device (angulated tip catheter), and 51% for the RAT device. Effluent particle rates for particles > 100 microns were 3.6% for the Trac-Wright catheter, 0.6% for US-OAT, and less than 0.1% for the other devices. Compared with the Trac-Wright catheter, the balance of clot-removing efficiency and creation of effluent particles favored the electric oscillating device with the angulated tip catheter, which had a slightly reduced, but still efficient, clot-removing capability and produced almost no effluent particles.",Schmitz-Rode T; Pfeffer JG; Bohndorf K; Günther RW,,1993,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,26754843,Design of a cone-and-plate device for controlled realistic shear stress stimulation on endothelial cell monolayers.,"Endothelial cells are constantly exposed to blood flow and the resulting frictional force, the wall shear stress, varies in magnitude and direction with time, depending on vasculature geometry. Previous studies have shown that the structure and function of endothelial cells, and ultimately of the vessel wall, are deeply affected by the nature of wall shear stress waveforms. To investigate the in vitro effects of these stimuli, we developed a compact, programmable, real-time operated system based on cone-and-plate geometry, that can be used within a standard cell incubator. To verify the capability to replicate realistic shear stress waveforms, we calculated both analytically and numerically to what extent the system is able to correctly deliver the stimuli defined by the user at plate level. Our results indicate that for radii greater than 25 mm, the shear stress is almost uniform and directly proportional to cone rotation velocity. We further established that using a threshold of 10 Hz of wall shear stress waveform frequency components, oscillating flow conditions can be reproduced on cell monolayer surface. Finally, we verified the capability of the system to perform long-term flow exposure experiments ensuring sterility and cell culture viability on human umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed to unidirectional and oscillating shear stress. In conclusion, the system we developed is a highly dynamic, easy to handle, and able to generate pulsatile and unsteady oscillating wall shear stress waveforms. This system can be used to investigate the effects of realistic stimulations on endothelial cells, similar to those exerted in vivo by blood flow.",Franzoni M; Cattaneo I; Ene-Iordache B; Oldani A; Righettini P; Remuzzi A,Computational fluid dynamics; Cone-and-plate; Endothelial cells; Shear stress,2016,Cytotechnology,Journal Article,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Perpendicular section-selective gradients for spatially selective excitation and refocusing RF pulses were applied to limit the refocused field-of-view (FOV) along the phase-encoding direction for each rectangular blade image. We performed comparison studies in phantoms and normal volunteers by using targeted-PROPELLER methods for a wide range of imaging applications that commonly use turbo-spin-echo (TSE) approaches (brain, abdominal, vessel wall, cardiac). RESULTS: In these initial studies, we demonstrated the feasibility of using targeted-PROPELLER approaches to limit the imaging FOV thereby reducing the number of blades or permitting increased spatial resolution without commensurate increases in scan time. Both phantom and in vivo motion studies demonstrated the potential for more robust regional self-navigated motion correction compared with conventional full FOV PROPELLER methods. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the reduced FOV targeted-PROPELLER technique offers the potential for reducing imaging time, increasing spatial resolution, and targeting specific areas for robust regional motion correction.",Deng J; Larson AC,,2009,Investigative radiology,Evaluation Study; Journal Article,R01 CA126809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R01 CA134719/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R01 CA134719-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,

The authors present the results of the mini-invasive repair at G. Gaslini Institute of Genoa, Italy. METHODS: Nuss mini-invasive repair avoids anterior scars. The correction is achieved by the introduction under thoracoscopy of a retrosternal curve bar that is rotated by 180 degrees . Postoperatory pain is managed by an epidural catheter. In all the operated patients we evaluated the clinical pre-operatory parameters (spirometric, radiological and cardiological data), the surgical details and the results. RESULTS: Fifty patients were operated, 43 of them males, ranging from 7 and 22 years of age, with an average of 17 years of age. Only 8 of them were asymptomatic and required surgery for psychological reasons. The 74% presented some stress dyspnea. Some impairment in spirometric parameters were observed in 28% and mitral valve prolapse in 30%. The only significant intra-operative complication was a bleeding from a thoracic wall vessel that required a left emergency minimal thoracotomy. Postoperative complications were: 2 pneumothorax (drained for 24 hours), 2 transitory pulmonary atelectasis, 1 hemothorax in a patient with coagulation deficit, 3 wound problems (1 infection and 2 hematomas). The esthetical score after surgery, according to the patients, was 9.15 on average, in a scale from 1 to 10. None rated less than 7. The pain score with the same scale was rated 6.8 on average.

We describe a successful urgent hybrid procedure for extent III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with aortic intramural hematoma. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old female with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm was considered at high surgical risk and unfit for open repair due to multiple comorbidities. Therefore, a hybrid procedure of surgeon-modified fenestrated endovascular graft combined with thoracoscope-assisted Transaortic epicardial fixation of endograft was finally chosen and performed in the endovascular operating room. A 3-port technique was performed through a left video-assisted thoracoscopic approach. After the first tampering stent-graft was deployed, a double-needle suture was penetrated both the aortic wall and stent-graft to fixate it in the proximal descending aorta. Then the second endograft, which had been fenestrated on table, was introduced and oriented extracorporeally by rotating superior mesenteric artery and left renal artery fenestration radiopaque markers and deployed with perfect apposition between the fenestrations and target visceral artery. Each vessel was sequentially stented using Viabahn self-expandable stent to finish target vessel stenting. An Ankura cuff stent was deployed in the distal abdominal aortic artery. CONCLUSION: Surgeon-modified fenestrated endovascular graft combined with thoracoscope-assisted fixation may be an innovative and viable alternative for selected high-risk patients with extent III thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm.

rotating_wall,34653994,Aneurysm presence at the anterior communicating artery bifurcation is associated with caliber tapering of the A1 segment.,"OBJECTIVE: Vessel tapering results in blood flow acceleration at downstream bifurcations (firehose nozzle effect), induces hemodynamics predisposing to aneurysm initiation, and has been associated with middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysm presence and rupture status. The authors sought to determine if vessel caliber tapering is a generalizable predisposing factor by evaluating upstream A1 segment profiles in association with aneurysm presence in the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) complex, the most prevalent cerebral aneurysm location associated with a high rupture risk. METHODS: Three-dimensional rotational angiographic studies were analyzed for 68 patients with ACoA aneurysms, 37 nonaneurysmal contralaterals, and 53 healthy bilateral controls (211 samples total). A1 segments were determined to be dominant, codominant, or nondominant based on flow and size. Equidistant cross-sectional orthogonal cuts were generated along the A1 centerline, and cross-sectional area (CSA) was evaluated proximally and distally, using intensity-invariant edge detection filtering. The relative tapering of the A1 segment was evaluated as the tapering ratio (distal/proximal CSA). Computational fluid dynamics was simulated on ACoA parametric models with and without tapering. RESULTS: Aneurysms occurred predominantly on dominant (79%) and codominant (17%) A1 segments. A1 segments leading to unruptured ACoA aneurysms had significantly greater tapering compared to nonaneurysmal contralaterals (0.69 ± 0.13 vs 0.80 ± 0.17, p = 0.001) and healthy controls (0.69 ± 0.13 vs 0.83 ± 0.16, p < 0.001), regardless of dominance labeling. There was no statistically significant difference in tapering values between contralateral A1 and healthy A1 controls (0.80 ± 0.17 vs 0.83 ± 0.16, p = 0.56). Hemodynamically, A1 segment tapering induces high focal pressure, high wall shear stress, and high velocity at the ACoA bifurcation. CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysmal, but not contralateral or healthy control, A1 segments demonstrated significant progressive vascular tapering, which is associated with aneurysmogenic hemodynamic conditions at the ACoA complex. Demonstration of the upstream tapering effect in the communicating ACoA segment is consistent with its prior detection in the noncommunicating MCA bifurcation, which together form more than 50% of intracranial aneurysms. The mechanistic characterization of this upstream vascular tapering phenomenon is warranted to understand its clinical relevance and devise potential therapeutic strategies.",Lauric A; Silveira L; Lesha E; Breton JM; Malek AM,ACoA aneurysms; aneurysm presence; intracranial aneurysms; vascular disorders; vessel tapering,2022,Journal of neurosurgery,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,34742467,[Why and how do I use the orbitalatherectomy ?].,"Severe coronary artery calcification, too often underestimated, increases the complexity of percutaneous coronary interventions. Atherectomy is one of preferred approach for the preparation of calcified lesions before stent placement. Orbital atherectomy (OA) is a new method that has proven to be safe and effective in the preparation of calcium plaques (ORBIT I and ORBIT II studies). The OA is made up of a crown mounted with diamonds that abrades the endoluminal calcium plaque by centrifugal force and creates pulsatile forces on the wall that fractures the deep calcified plaques in the media. The OA Diamondback 360 ™ consists of a tableside electric powered motor handle connected to a drive shaft mounted with an eccentric crown. The OA specific 0.012"" coronary guidewire made of Nitinol (ViperWire ™) has 3 qualities; the torquability, the ease of navigation and the support. Compared to rotational atherectomy, AO is associated with a lower rate of MACE at 1 year, with less revascularization of the target vessel and reduced fluoroscopy time but at the cost of an increased rate of coronary dissection and perforation.

METHODS: Data on 16 patients were reviewed retrospectively. Radical neoplasm resection and immediate abdominal wall reconstruction using the combined technique of intraperitoneal mesh placement, sublay technique, pedicled great omentum flap, and rotation skin graft were performed. RESULTS: Sixteen patients underwent radical abdominal wall neoplasm resection, achieving clear margin of >3 cm. The mean size of consequent giant defect was 226.5 ± 65.5 cm(2), with a mean polypropylene mesh size of 160.7 ± 40.5 cm(2) and a mean compound mesh size of 330.8 ± 100.2 cm(2). Sixteen patients had a mean follow-up duration of 32.5 ± 12.5 months. Four patients developed incisional infections, and 1 patient died of several metastatic lesions 24 months postoperatively.

rotating_wall,35882551,Non-contrast enhanced silent MR angiography to evaluate hemodynamics and morphology of unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a comparative computational fluid dynamics study.,"BACKGROUND: Silent MR angiography (silent MRA) is a new generation of non-contrast enhanced angiography with outstanding advantages in visualizing cerebrovascular lesions and the follow-up after endovascular treatment for intracranial aneurysms (IAs). This study aims to investigate the reliability of silent MRA-based three-dimensional (3D) geometric description and hemodynamic calculation of IAs. METHODS: 19 patients with 23 unruptured IAs, who underwent both silent MRA and 3D rotational angiography (3DRA), were included in this study. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed on all patient-specific 3D reconstruction images to compare the morphology and hemodynamics of the two different imaging models for IAs. RESULTS: Silent MRA models had smaller maximum and perpendicular height (mm), aneurysmal surface area (mm(2)), and aneurysmal volume (mm(3)) than 3DRA (p<0.05); the differences of the above parameters between the two models were 9.0±6.2%, 7.7±7.4%, 15.9±13.0%, and 21.4±17.5%, respectively. However, correlation analysis of morphological parameters in various dimensions and model comparison showed good overall consistency in geometrical characteristics between the two models. Moderate coherence was observed between models in time-averaged wall shear stress of aneurysm and parent vessel (TAWSS, PAWSS), aneurysm velocity (AV), parent vessel velocity, and oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, strong correlations were observed among normalized aneurysm wall shear stress (NWSS), low shear area (LSA), inflow concentration index (ICI), and normalized aneurysm velocity (NAV). CONCLUSION: Both morphological and hemodynamic assessments of IAs for silent MRA are comparable to 3DRA. Additionally, normalized indicators such as NWSS, LSA, ICI, and NAV were better than TAWSS, AV, and OSI in silent MRA-related hemodynamic evaluation. permissions.

Recently, relevant physiological changes during space exploration have attracted much attention. Thus, space exploration might provide some inspiration for cancer research. Using on ground different methods in order to simulate microgravity, structure and function of cancer cells undergo many unique changes, such as cell aggregation to form 3D spheroids, cell-cycle inhibition, and changes in migration ability and apoptosis. Although numerous better experiments have been conducted on this subject, the results are not consistent. The reason might be that different methods for simulation have been used, including clinostats, random positioning machine (RPM) and rotating wall vessel (RWV) and so on.

To this purpose, U937 cells were cultured in the NASA-developed bioreactor Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) as a device to simulate microgravity on earth. No apoptosis was detected, in part because of the up-regulation of hsp70. In agreement with results obtained in space-flown U937 cells, the cells grew more slowly in the RWV than under normal conditions and this correlated with the down-modulation of cdc25B.

In this study, we show how the delivery of oxygen to cells in an annular flow bioreactor is enhanced by the forced convective transport afforded by Taylor vortex flows. A fiberoptic oxygen probe with negligible lag time was used to measure the dissolved oxygen concentration in real time and under carefully controlled aeration conditions. From these data, the overall mass transfer coefficients were calculated and mass transport correlations determined under laminar Couette flow conditions and discrete Taylor vortex flow regimes, including laminar, wavy, and turbulent flows. While oxygen transport in Taylor vortex flows was significantly greater, and the available oxygen exceeded that consumed by murine fibroblasts in free suspension, the proportion of cells that remained viable decreased with increasing Reynolds number (101.8 < Rei < 1018), which we attribute to the action of fluid shear stresses on the cells as opposed to any limitation in mass transport. Nevertheless, the results of this study suggest that laminar Taylor-vortex flow regimes provide an effective means of maintaining the levels of oxygen transport required for long-term cell culture.",Curran SJ; Black RA,,2005,Biotechnology and bioengineering,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,3196602,Synthetic vascular graft fabrication by a precipitation-flotation method.,"The authors report a new technique for fabricating synthetic vascular grafts. It involves spraying a polymer solution (generated by mixing polymer solution and nitrogen gas in a spray nozzle) onto the surface of a flowing nonsolvent liquid (water): polymer fibers form during precipitation of the spray drops as they travel on the water surface, until picked up by a partially submerged rotating mandrel. Depending on process conditions, these fibers may aggregate to form a continuous layer or remain separated until they are picked up. A number of independent process variables allow control of characteristics of the conduits: gas and polymer solution feed rates, nozzle traverse speed, nonsolvent (water) flow rate, spray-mandrel spacing, and mandrel rpm. The SEM reveals that the graft wall consists of numerous fused polymeric fibers arrayed in both the circumferential and axial directions. The inner surface resembles a mesh of closely spaced fused fibers. The conduits have walls with interconnected pores (water permeabilities between 0.05 to 7.0 ml/min-cm2); nonporous surfaces also can be made. Tensile stress of the grafts at failure (in radial direction) varied between 0.05 to 2.3 MPa, whereas elongation at break ranged between 150 to 600%, depending on the porosity and fabrication conditions.

rotating_wall,32681192,Multimodal validation of focal enhancement in intracranial aneurysms as a surrogate marker for aneurysm instability.,"PURPOSE: Circumferential enhancement on MR vessel wall imaging has been proposed as a biomarker of a higher risk of rupture in intracranial aneurysms. Focal enhancement is frequently encountered in unruptured aneurysms, but its implication for risk stratification and patient management remains unclear. This study investigates the association of focal wall enhancement with hemodynamic and morphological risk factors and histologic markers of wall inflammation and degeneration. METHODS: Patients with an unruptured middle cerebral artery aneurysm who underwent 3D rotational angiography and 3T MR vessel wall imaging showing focal wall enhancement were included. Hemodynamic parameters were calculated based on flow simulations and compared between enhanced regions and the entire aneurysm surface. Morphological parameters were semiautomatically extracted and quantitatively associated with wall enhancement. Histological analysis included detection of vasa vasorum, CD34, and myeloperoxidase staining in a subset of patients. RESULTS: Twenty-two aneurysms were analyzed. Enhanced regions were significantly associated with lower AWSS, lower maxOSI, and increased LSA. In multivariate analysis, higher ellipticity index was an independent predictor of wall enhancement. Histologic signs of inflammation and degeneration and higher PHASES score were significantly associated with focal enhancement. CONCLUSION: Focal wall enhancement is colocalized with hemodynamic factors that have been related to a higher rupture risk. It is correlated with morphological factors linked to rupture risk, higher PHASES score, and histologic markers of wall destabilization. The results support the hypothesis that focal enhancement could serve as a surrogate marker for aneurysm instability.",Larsen N; Flüh C; Saalfeld S; Voß S; Hille G; Trick D; Wodarg F; Synowitz M; Jansen O; Berg P,Hemodynamics; Histology; Intracranial aneurysm; Magnetic resonance imaging; Morphology; Subarachnoid hemorrhage,2020,Neuroradiology,Journal Article; Validation Study,"13GW0095A/Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung/; SA 3461/2-1, BE 6230/2-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft/; ZS/2016/04/78123/European Regional Development Fund/",

In the present paper, osteoblasts isolated from the cranium of 1-month-old Zelanian rabbits were inoculated on to the BDBS (bio-derived bone scaffolds) to investigate the three-dimensional fabrication of engineered bone in an RWVB (rotating-wall vessel bioreactor). The osteoblasts, after being transfected with green fluorescent protein, were respectively seeded at 2 x 10(6) and 1 x 10(6) cells x ml(-1) on to the BDBS and then cultured in a T-flask and an RWVB for 1 week. The morphologies and structure of the fabricated bone were investigated by using an inverted microscope, a scanning electron microscope and a laser confocal microscope using the stains haematoxylin/eosin and Toluidine Blue. After being digested from the scaffolds, the cells were assayed with ALP (alkaline phosphatase) stain, von-Kossa staining on mineralized nodules, type I collagen and bone morphogenetic protein-2 expression, and the cell expansion and growth curves using different culture methods were quantitatively determined with MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide). Furthermore, cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by using a flow cytometer, and total DNA was also assayed. For a comparative study, cell-seeded constructs were also cultured under static conditions. The results show that the cell number cultured in the RWVB was five times that in the T-flask. Bone tissues cultured in the RWVB with two different densities grew well, and the osteoblasts maintained their normal cycle and DNA content. The result demonstrates that, with the stress stimulation in the fluid in the RWVB, the active expression of ALP can be increased, rapid proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts are possible and the three-dimensional fabrication of engineered bone could be realized.",Song K; Yang Z; Liu T; Zhi W; Li X; Deng L; Cui Z; Ma X,,2006,Biotechnology and applied biochemistry,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

CONCLUSIONS: The 3D images enabled a perfect preoperative planning through the operation by illuminating the aneurysm anatomy, neck localisation and shape and relation of the aneurysm to neighbouring vessels. Operative approach, use of an accurate clip and avoidance of clipping arteries close to the aneurysm have become predictable and safer by the use of 3D angiography.",Petridis AK; Doukas A; Niu H; Barth H; Maslehaty H; Riedel C; Jansen O; Mehdorn HM,,2011,VASA.

Given the difficulty of obtaining carefully controlled measurements in vivo, most of our current concepts of the flow behavior of blood in vivo are based on its properties in vitro. Studies of blood rheology in rotational and tube viscometers have defined the basic properties of blood and pointed to certain features that may be especially significant for understanding in vivo function. At the same time, differences between in vivo and in vitro systems combined with the complex rheological properties of blood make it difficult to predict in vivo blood rheology from in vitro studies. We have investigated certain flow properties of blood in vivo, using the venular network of skeletal muscle as our model system. In the presence of red blood cell aggregation, venous velocity profiles become blunted from the parabolic as in Poiseuille flow, as pseudo-shear rate (= mean fluid velocity/vessel diameter) is decreased from approximately 100 s(-1) to 5 s(-1). At control flow rates, the short distance between venular junctions does not appear to permit significant axial migration and red cell depletion of the peripheral fluid layer before additional red cells and aggregates are infused from a feeding tributary. Formation of a cell-free plasma layer at the vessel wall and sedimentation in vivo are evident only at very low pseudo-shear rates (<5 s(-1)). These findings may explain in large part observations in whole organs of increased venous resistance with reduction of blood flow.",Bishop JJ; Popel AS; Intaglietta M; Johnson PC,,2001,Biorheology,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Review",HL-52684/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; HL-64395/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,28144266,Clinical importance of duodenal recesses with special reference to internal hernias.,"INTRODUCTION: The detailed knowledge of the peritoneal recesses has great significance with respect to internal hernias. The recesses are usually related to rotation and adhesion of abdominal viscera to the posterior abdominal wall and/or the presence of retroperitoneal vessels which raises the serosal fold. The duodenal recesses are usually related to the 3(rd) and 4(th) parts of the duodenum. Internal hernias with respect to these recesses are difficult to diagnose clinically and usually noticed at the time of laparotomy. So, the knowledge of these recesses can be valuable to abdominal surgeons. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study was conducted in 100 cases including 10 cadavers, 45 post mortem cases and 45 cases undergoing laparotomy. RESULTS: We found superior and inferior duodenal recesses in 28% and 52% respectively, paraduodenal in 12%, mesentericoparietal in 3%, retroduodenal in 2% and duodenojejunal in 18% of cases. Two abnormal duodenojejunal recesses were found, one on the right (instead of the left) of the abdominal aorta, and in the other the opening was directed upwards instead of downwards. The incidence of internal hernias was 3%. CONCLUSIONS: Thus it was observed that there is low incidence of superior and inferior duodenal recesses, and high incidence of paraduodenal recess. The abnormal recesses might be due to malrotation of the gut. In laparotomy cases, the internal hernia was noticed when the abdomen was opened for intestinal obstruction. The incidence of internal hernia was found to be high.",Tambe SV; Rana KK; Kakar A; Aggarwal S; Aggrawal A; Kakar S; Borkar N,internal hernias; peritoneal recesses; retroperitoneal vessels,2017,Archives of medical science : AMS,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,19304314,Swirling flow created in a glass tube suppressed platelet adhesion to the surface of the tube: its implication in the design of small-caliber arterial grafts.,"To test the hypothesis that intentionally inducing swirling blood flow in a small-caliber arterial graft can suppress acute thrombus formation by affecting the adhesion of platelets to the internal surface of the graft, an experimental comparative study was designed to investigate the effect of swirling flow on the adhesion and activation of platelets in a straight glass tube coated with calf skin type I collagen. The experimental results showed that when compared with the normal flow, the swirling flow generated in the test tube significantly reduced the platelet adhesion to the surface of the test tube. Different from normal flow condition under which platelet adhesion increased simply with decreasing wall shear stress, the platelet adhesion density under swirling flow condition remained almost unchanged along the first 5 mm section of the tube in which the flow had relatively high rotation strength, even though the wall shear stress in this section of the tube dropped drastically. This suggests that when the swirling flow in the tube was strong enough, platelet adhesion was dominantly affected by the swirling flow itself, wall shear stress was secondary. The results also showed that there was no significant difference in the activation of platelets between the spiral flow group and the normal flow group. The present study therefore suggests that intentionally introducing swirling flow in small-caliber arterial grafts has no adverse effect on platelet activation and may indeed be a solution to improving the patency of the grafts by suppressing acute thrombus formation.",Zhan F; Fan Y; Deng X,,2010,Thrombosis research,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,21858990,Magnetic cell delivery for peripheral arterial disease: A theoretical framework.,"PURPOSE: Our aim was to compare different magnet arrangements for magnetic cell delivery to human lower leg arteries and investigate the theoretical targeting efficiency under realistic flow conditions as a possible treatment after angioplasty. Additionally the potential of scaling down or translating the magnetic actuation device for preclinical studies was explored. METHODS: Using finite element methods, the magnetic field distribution was calculated in 3D for the optimization of magnet arrangements. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed for the human posterior tibial artery with the geometry and boundary condition data derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. These simulations were used to trace the trajectories of cells for an optimized magnet arrangement. Additionally the behavior of cells close to the vessel wall was investigated using a fluid-structure interaction model. RESULTS: The optimal magnet for the lower leg arteries was a Halbach cylinder k3 variety (12 elements with 900 rotation steps for the magnetization orientation). With this magnet, numerical simulations predict a targeting efficiency of 6.25% could be achieved in the posterior tibial artery for cells containing 150 pg iron. Similar simulations, which were scaled down to rabbit dimensions while keeping the forces acting on a cell constant, lead to similar predicted targeting efficiencies. Fluid dynamic and fluid-structure interaction simulations predict that magnetically labeled cells within a 0.5% radii distance to the vessel wall would be attracted and remain at the wall under physiological flow conditions. CONCLUSIONS: First pass capture of magnetically labeled cells under pulsatile flow conditions in human lower leg arteries leads to low targeting efficiencies. However, this can be increased to almost 100% by stopping the blood flow for 5 min. A magnetic actuation device can be designed for animal models that generate magnetic forces achievable for cells in human leg arteries.",Riegler J; Lau KD; Garcia-Prieto A; Price AN; Richards T; Pankhurst QA; Lythgoe MF,,2011,Medical physics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom,
rotating_wall,8065880,[Three-dimensional CT imaging of pulmonary nodules using helical scan CT].,"To evaluate the usefulness of three-dimensional (3D) imaging of pulmonary nodules from helical scan CT images, 3D reconstructions were performed in 23 patients, using a CEMAX VIPstation. These cases included 15 lung cancers, six metastatic lung cancers, an aspergilloma and a tuberculoma. The equipment used was a Toshiba CT system, the X force. Helical scan CT data were acquired using up to 20 continuous 1.5 sec rotations with an X-ray beam width of 5 mm and a couchtop movement speed of 5 mm/1.5 sec, and during a single breath-hold. Axial images were reconstructed at a section interval of 2 mm. Helical scan CT permits axial images to be reconstructed at any desired position within the scanned area, and provides images without interslice gaps caused by respiratory movement. Therefore, high-quality 3D images can be obtained from these data. Concerning the optimum threshold range of CT number of 3D reconstruction, we clarified the lower and upper limits (lower/upper), as follows: 1) Solid pulmonary nodule: (-700-(-)400/-100 HU) 2) Tumor invaded to pleura or chest wall: (-700-(-)400/-200 HU) 3) Pulmonary nodule with cavity: (-700-(-)400/50 HU) 4) Small pulmonary nodule (< 10 mm): (-750-(-)600/-100 HU) In all cases, it was possible not only to demonstrate abnormal findings three-dimensionally, but also to grasp anatomical relationships among the pulmonary nodule, bronchi, vessels and chest wall. In conclusion, it was considered that 3D CT imaging provided additional anatomical information and was very useful.",Shimizu T; Narabayashi I; Uesugi Y; Namba R; Ogura Y; Tabuchi K; Nakata Y; Ashina K; Maeda H; Sueyoshi K,,1994,Nihon Igaku Hoshasen Gakkai zasshi.

rotating_wall,143277,[Early embryonal maldevelopment of the umbilical cord with defect of the abdominal wall and severe body malformations (dysplasia umbilico-fetalis) (author's transl)].,"A case of dysplasia umbilico-fetalis is demonstrated. The malformation comprises a rare and strange reduction anomaly of the feto-umbilical unit, which is caused during early embryonic life (around the 7 mm stage, corresponding to the end of the third week of gestation). The cause of the damage is not known. The folding off of the embryo from the yolk sac and the development of the abdominal stalk are impaired. No abdominal wall is formed, and the umbilicus and umbilical cord are not developed. The abdominal organs are enclosed in a short amnion-mesoderm tube, which is bordered by the retroperitoneum at the fetal side and by the chorionic plate at the placenta side. The umbilical vessels are only a few centimeters long and traverse in the mesodermal layer of the amnion-mesoderm tube. The thin wall of the tube usually ruptures before birth, thus causing an abacterial fibrinoid peritonitis by the chemical irritation of the peritoneum through the constituents of the amniotic fluid. The lower extremities of the fetus reveal varying degrees of reduction deformities. One leg and large parts of the pelvis may be entirely missing, if the side of origin of the extremity is included in the amnion-mesoderm tube. Severe kyphoscoliosis is probably a secondary phenomenon. In addition, malformations of the inner organs occur such as caudal displacement and hernia of the diaphragma, hypoplasia of the lungs, dysplasia of the genito-urinary tract and non-rotation of the gut. The pathophysiology of the rare developmental defect and its secondary implications are discussed with special reference to related malformations such as omphalocele and infraumbilical defect of the abdominal wall.",Ullrich K; Böhm N,,1977,Beitrage zur Pathologie,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,,

By mean Day 240, the fetus and nearly all of the pool of allantoic fluid are confined to the uterine body. Intrauterine fetal-location changes end, but in-place activity of limbs, head, and body and changes in fetal recumbency and presentation continue, sometimes vigorously. Preference for cranial presentation (fetal sternum toward maternal cervix) has been hypothesized to be stimulated by ∼ 40° incline of uterine body toward the cervix. The uterine body expands forward, but the closed uterine horns are held more closely at the tips and become perpendicular to the cranial uterine body. After closure of horns, both hind limbs enter the umbilical-cord horn apparently guided by dorsal recumbency (fetal spine toward uterine floor), close proximity of hind hooves to horn entrance, and a thick covering of each main umbilical vessel by Wharton's jelly. The limb-encased horn then begins to lie on the upper surface of the uterine body from flexure of the hind limbs. The active fetal rump may raise off the uterine floor so that the hooves of the hind limbs reach the area above the cervix. Dorsal fetal recumbency is anchored by the horn-encased hind limbs, but when the uterus rests on the mare's ventral abdominal wall, the loosened suspensory ligaments allow more rotational freedom. During parturition, the fetal head and withers twist toward the mare's spine, and the rear follows like a corkscrew.",Ginther OJ,Closed uterine horns; Deciduous hoof capsule; Hind-limb encasement; Presentation; Tonic immobility,2022,Journal of equine veterinary science,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",,
rotating_wall,38618177,Method for Large-scale Production of hIPSC Spheroids.,"Stem cell spheroids are rapidly becoming essential tools for a diverse array of applications ranging from tissue engineering to 3D cell models and fundamental biology. Given the increasing prominence of biotechnology, there is a pressing need to develop more accessible, efficient, and reproducible methods for producing these models. Various techniques such as hanging drop, rotating wall vessel, magnetic levitation, or microfluidics have been employed to generate spheroids. However, none of these methods facilitate the easy and efficient production of a large number of spheroids using a standard 6-well plate. Here, we present a novel method based on pellet culture (utilizing U-shaped microstructures) using a silicon mold produced through 3D printing, along with a detailed and illustrated manufacturing protocol. This technique enables the rapid production of reproducible and controlled spheroids (for 1× 10(6) cells, spheroids = 130 ± 10 μm) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCs) within a short time frame (24 h). Importantly, the method allows the production of large quantities (2 × 10(4) spheroids for 1 × 10(6) cells) in an accessible and cost-effective manner, thanks to the use of a reusable mold. The protocols outlined herein are easily implementable, and all the necessary files for the method replication are freely available. Key features • Provision of 3D mold files (STL) to produce silicone induction device of spheroids using 3D printing. • Cost-effective, reusable, and autoclavable device capable of generating up to 1.2 × 10(4) spheroids of tunable diameters in a 6-well plate. • Spheroids induction with multiple hIPSC cell lines. • Robust and reproducible production method suitable for routine laboratory use.

rotating_wall,25173265,An upgrade of the magnetic diagnostic system of the DIII-D tokamak for non-axisymmetric measurements.,"The DIII-D tokamak magnetic diagnostic system [E. J. Strait, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 77, 023502 (2006)] has been upgraded to significantly expand the measurement of the plasma response to intrinsic and applied non-axisymmetric ""3D"" fields. The placement and design of 101 additional sensors allow resolution of toroidal mode numbers 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and poloidal wavelengths smaller than MARS-F, IPEC, and VMEC magnetohydrodynamic model predictions. Small 3D perturbations, relative to the equilibrium field (10(-5) < δB/B0 < 10(-4)), require sub-millimeter fabrication and installation tolerances. This high precision is achieved using electrical discharge machined components, and alignment techniques employing rotary laser levels and a coordinate measurement machine. A 16-bit data acquisition system is used in conjunction with analog signal-processing to recover non-axisymmetric perturbations. Co-located radial and poloidal field measurements allow up to 14.2 cm spatial resolution of poloidal structures (plasma poloidal circumference is ~500 cm). The function of the new system is verified by comparing the rotating tearing mode structure, measured by 14 BP fluctuation sensors, with that measured by the upgraded B(R) saddle loop sensors after the mode locks to the vessel wall. The result is a nearly identical 2/1 helical eigenstructure in both cases.",King JD; Strait EJ; Boivin RL; Taussig D; Watkins MG; Hanson JM; Logan NC; Paz-Soldan C; Pace DC; Shiraki D; Lanctot MJ; La Haye RJ; Lao LL; Battaglia DJ; Sontag AC; Haskey SR; Bak JG,,2014,The Review of scientific instruments,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,9581798,Suppressed PHA activation of T lymphocytes in simulated microgravity is restored by direct activation of protein kinase C.,"Utilizing clinostatic rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors that simulate aspects of microgravity, we found phytohemagglutinin (PHA) responsiveness to be almost completely diminished. Activation marker expression was significantly reduced in RWV cultures. Furthermore, cytokine secretion profiles suggested that monocytes are not as adversely affected by simulated microgravity as T cells. Reduced cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions may play a role in the loss of PHA responsiveness because placing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) within small collagen beads did partially restore PHA responsiveness. However, activation of purified T cells with cross-linked CD2/CD28 and CD3/CD28 antibody pairs was completely suppressed in the RWV, suggesting a defect in signal transduction. Activation of purified T cells with PMA and ionomycin was unaffected by RWV culture. Furthermore, sub-mitogenic doses of PMA alone but not ionomycin alone restored PHA responsiveness of PBMC in RWV culture.

There is limited evidence that microgravity condition may affect development of ovarian follicles. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of simulated microgravity on the in vitro development of mouse preantral follicles. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ovarian tissue from 14-day-old mice, or preantral follicles mechanically isolated from 14-day-old mouse ovaries were cultured at a simulated microgravity condition generated using a rotating wall vessel apparatus. Follicle survival was assessed quantitatively using H&E staining. Follicle diameter and oocyte diameter were measured under an inverted microscope. Ultrastructure of oocytes was evaluated using transmission electron microscopy. We observed that simulated microgravity compromised follicle survival in vitro, downregulated PCNA and GDF-9 expressions, and caused ultrastructural abnormalities in oocytes. CONCLUSION: This study showed for the first time that three-dimensional culture condition generated by simulated microgravity is detrimental to the initial stage development of mouse preantral follicles in vitro. The experimental setup provides a model to further investigate the mechanisms involved in the in vitro developmental processes of oocytes/granulosa cells under the microgravity condition.",Zhang S; Zheng D; Wu Y; Lin W; Chen Z; Meng L; Liu J; Zhou Y,,2016,PloS one,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

We show, for the first time, that noroviruses can infect and replicate in a physiologically relevant 3-dimensional (3-D), organoid model of human small intestinal epithelium. This level of cellular differentiation was achieved by growing the cells on porous collagen-I coated microcarrier beads under conditions of physiological fluid shear in rotating wall vessel bioreactors. Microscopy, PCR, and fluorescent in situ hybridization provided evidence of norovirus infection.

The human Ntera-2/D1 (NT2) cell line is an attractive alternative to the use of human fetal neurons as a cell source for transplantation. We have explored combining NT2 cells, as a neuronal source, and Sertoli cells, which may act as a graft facilitator to enhance neuronal survival and differentiation, and ameliorate the host immune response, into a tissue construct for use in cell replacement therapy for neurodegenerative disease. This Sertoli-NT2-aggregated cell (SNAC) tissue construct is formed in the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) bioreactor. NT2 cells differentiate to dopaminergic NT2N neurons within the SNAC tissue construct without retinoic acid. We report here that the gap junction protein connexin 43 is decreased among differentiated NT2N neurons. Inhibition of connexin 43 with 18beta glycyrrhetinic acid and carbenoxolone, a glycyrrhetinic acid derivative, during formation of the SNAC tissue constructs disrupts the differentiation of NT2 cells. Therefore, connexin 43 is important in the differentiation of NT2 cells in the SNAC tissue construct.",Shamekh R; Cameron DF; Willing AE; Saporta S,,2006,Experimental brain research,Journal Article,,

Although the mechanism has not been defined, it is reasonable to begin developing effective countermeasures to the physiological consequences of spaceflight, especially immunosuppression. Many studies have been published about the effect of flavonoids on immune modulation. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop whether flavonoids could be the effective countermeasures to the immunosuppression caused by microgravity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a rotating wall vessel 3D (three-dimensional) culture system which recreates some of the culture conditions that occur during microgravity to study the effects of microgravity on the function of macrophages and assess the modulating effects of flavonoids on microgravity-induced macrophage dysfunction. RESULTS: We demonstrated 65% and 80% reduction in mitogen-induced nitric oxide and cytokine production of 3D-cultured macrophages, compared to conventional two-dimensional (2D)-cultured cells. Moreover, the microgravity-induced macrophage dysfunction was not restored by transferring cells from 3D to 2D culture. However, the addition of morin sulphates/glucuronides in 3D culture compensated for the loss of macrophage function. CONCLUSION: The result presented here suggests for the first time that an immune-modulatory strategy using flavonoid supplements such as morin would benefit the health of astronauts.",Hsieh CL; Chao PD; Fang SH,,2005,European journal of clinical investigation,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Cell survival, induction of apoptosis and cell cycle alteration were compared in cells irradiated and then incubated in 1g or modeled microgravity conditions. Modulation of genomic damage induced by ionizing radiation was evaluated on the basis of HPRT mutant frequency and the micronucleus assay. A significant reduction in apoptotic cells was observed in cells incubated in modeled microgravity after gamma irradiation compared with cells maintained in 1g. Moreover, in irradiated cells, fewer G2-phase cells were found in modeled microgravity than in 1g, whereas more G1-phase cells were observed in modeled microgravity than in 1g. Genomic damage induced by ionizing radiation, i.e. frequency of HPRT mutants and micronucleated cells, increased more in cultures incubated in modeled microgravity than in 1g. Our results indicate that modeled microgravity incubation after irradiation affects cell response to ionizing radiation, reducing the level of radiation-induced apoptosis.

Bicuspid pulmonary valve disease is rare and a small numbers of case reports describe concomitant pulmonary artery dilation similar to the dilation of the ascending aorta, which is often seen in BAVs disease. We examined three cases of bicuspid pulmonary valve disease, 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with BAV disease but a tricuspid pulmonary valve. All participants underwent anatomical and functional imaging of the pulmonary valve, pulmonary artery, and right ventricle as well as advanced time-resolved 3-dimensional cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (4D flow) to assess the flow pattern in the pulmonary artery. All patients with a bicuspid pulmonary valve had pulmonary artery dilation and showed distinct helical flow abnormalities with increased rotational flow and increased flow displacement compared to a mild left-handed flow pattern in the healthy volunteers. Additionally, there was marked asymmetry seen in the systolic wall shear stress (WSS) pattern, with the highest values in the anterior wall of the pulmonary artery. In comparison, patients with a BAV but a tricuspid pulmonary valve had normal flow patterns in the pulmonary artery. These haemodynamic findings are similar to recent studies in bicuspid aortic disease, and suggest the importance of flow patterns in the pathophysiology of vessel dilation in both aortic and pulmonary bicuspid valve disease.",Bissell MM; Loudon M; Neubauer S; Myerson SG,4D flow MRI; bicuspid valve disease; dilation; helical flow; humans,2017,Frontiers in physiology,Journal Article,FS/10/043/28415/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom; FS/10/43/28415/BHF_/British Heart Foundation/United Kingdom,

Method: We developed a protocol to produce lung mature type I pneumocytes using encapsulation of human IPSCs in 1.1% (w/v) alginate solution within a rotating wall bioreactor system in only 20 days without using feeder cells. The aim was to reduce exposure to animal products and laborious interventions in the future. Results: The three-dimensional (3D) bioprocess allowed cell derivation into endoderm, and subsequently into type II alveolar epithelial cells within a very short period. Cells successfully expressed surfactant proteins C and B associated with type II alveolar epithelial cells, and the key structure of lamellar bodies and microvilli was shown by transmission electron microscopy. The survival rate was the highest under dynamic conditions, which reveal the possibility of adapting this integration for large-scale cell production of alveolar epithelial cells from human IPSCs. Discussion: We were able to develop a strategy for the culture and differentiation of human IPSCs into alveolar type II cells using an in vitro system that mimics the in vivo environment. Hydrogel beads would offer a suitable matrix for 3D cultures and that the high-aspect-ratio vessel bioreactor can be used to increase the differentiation of human IPSCs relative to the results obtained with traditional monolayer cultures.",Alsobaie S; Alsobaie T; Alshammary A; Mantalaris S,3D culture; IPSCs; bioprocess; dynamic condition; lung development,2023,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,Journal Article,,

As it is now possible to represent an anatomically accurate intracranial aneurysm in a computational model, we have attempted to simulate its endosaccular occlusion with coils and demonstrate the haemodynamic changes induced. This is the first attempt to use this particular porous medium-based method for coiling simulation in a CFD model, to our knowledge. METHODS: Datasets from a rotational 3-D digital subtraction angiogram of a recently ruptured anterior communicating aneurysm were converted into a 3-D geometric model and the discretized data were processed using the computational technique developed. Coiling embolisation simulation was achieved by impediment of flow through a porous medium with characteristics following a series of embolisation coils. Haemodynamic parameters studied were: pressure distribution on the vessel wall, blood velocity and blood flow patterns. RESULTS: Significant haemodynamic changes were detected after deployment of the first coil. Similar, but less dramatic changes occurred during subsequent stages of coiling. The blood flow patterns became less vortical in the aneurysm sac as velocity decreased to stagnation and the wall pressure at the fundus was gradually reduced.

rotating_wall,25210716,Conditioned media from microvascular endothelial cells cultured in simulated microgravity inhibit osteoblast activity.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Gravity contributes to the maintenance of bone integrity. Accordingly, weightlessness conditions during space flight accelerate bone loss and experimental models in real and simulated microgravity show decreased osteoblastic and increased osteoclastic activities. It is well known that the endothelium and bone cells cross-talk and this intercellular communication is vital to regulate bone homeostasis. Because microgravity promotes microvascular endothelial dysfunction, we anticipated that the molecular cross-talk between endothelial cells exposed to simulated microgravity and osteoblasts might be altered. RESULTS: We cultured human microvascular endothelial cells in simulated microgravity using the rotating wall vessel device developed by NASA. Endothelial cells in microgravity show growth inhibition and release higher amounts of matrix metalloproteases type 2 and interleukin-6 than controls. Conditioned media collected from microvascular endothelial cells in simulated microgravity were used to culture human osteoblasts and were shown to retard osteoblast proliferation and inhibit their activity. DISCUSSION: Microvascular endothelial cells in microgravity are growth retarded and release high amounts of matrix metalloproteases type 2 and interleukin-6, which might play a role in retarding the growth of osteoblasts and impairing their osteogenic activity. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that since simulated microgravity modulates microvascular endothelial cell function, it indirectly impairs osteoblastic function.",Cazzaniga A; Castiglioni S; Maier JA,,2014,BioMed research international,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

In the present study, R. rubrum S1H was cultured in a rotating wall vessel (RWV), simulating partial microgravity conditions on Earth. The bacterium showed a significant response to cultivation in simulated microgravity at the transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolic levels. In simulated microgravity conditions three N-acyl-l-homoserine lactones (C10-HSL, C12-HSL and 3-OH-C14-HSL) were detected in concentrations that were twice those detected under normal gravity, while no differences in cell density was detected. In addition, R. rubrum cultivated in modelled microgravity showed higher pigmentation than the normal gravity control, without change in culture oxygenation. When compared to randomized microgravity cultivation using a random positioning machine, significant overlap for the top differentially expressed genes and proteins was observed. Cultivation in this new artificial environment of simulated microgravity showed new properties of this well-known bacterium, including its first, to our knowledge, complete quorum-sensing-related N-acylhomoserine lactone profile.",Mastroleo F; Van Houdt R; Atkinson S; Mergeay M; Hendrickx L; Wattiez R; Leys N,,2013,"Microbiology (Reading, England)","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

We hypothesized that a microgravity 3D culture system would improve upon the growth and function of a pancreatic progenitor cell population. We developed a rotating wall vessel bioreactor and established a culture system using a pancreatic cell line. Cells in the bioreactors showed robust proliferation, enhanced transcriptional signaling, and improved translation of pancreatic genes compared with two-dimensional static culture. Cells also gained the ability to respond to glucose stimulation, which was not observed in the control cultures. These findings suggest that a 3D microgravity bioreactor environment mimics the niche of the pancreas yielding a cell source with potential for cell-based therapy in the treatment of diabetes.",Samuelson L; Gerber DA,,2013,"Tissue engineering.

Most patients (71%) had diffuse coronary artery disease, defined as a stenosis greater than 1 cm in length. Previous restenosis after balloon angioplasty was present in 21% and 10% had an ostial lesion. Adjunctive balloon angioplasty was not used to reduce residual stenosis after atherectomy. The procedure was successful in 76% of patients. Procedural success was achieved in 92% of patients with a lesion less than or equal to 1 cm in length, but in only 70% of patients with a lesion greater than 1 cm in length (p less than 0.01). One patient sustained abrupt closure of the target vessel, resulting in emergency bypass surgery and death. Small non-Q wave myocardial infarction occurred in eight patients (19%) and was associated with a longer lesion. The mean peak creatine kinase value in patients with non-Q wave myocardial infarction was 683 U/liter. Transient regional wall motion abnormalities were noted on the postatherectomy left ventricular angiogram in four of the eight patients with non-Q wave myocardial infarction. Follow-up angiography (at a mean interval of 6.2 +/- 2.6 months) was performed in 91% of patients and revealed restenosis (greater than 50% narrowing) in 59% The resistance rate was 22% for short lesions (less than or equal to 1 cm) and 75% for long lesions (greater than 1 cm) (p less than 0.05). In this study, the results of high speed rotational coronary atherectomy were strongly influenced by lesion length.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Teirstein PS; Warth DC; Haq N; Jenkins NS; McCowan LC; Aubanel-Reidel P; Morris N; Ginsburg R,,1991,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,Journal Article,,

Recent work has seen organoids gain prominence as a valuable model for studying tissue development, drug discovery, and potential clinical applications. The requirements for the successful culture of organoids in vitro differ significantly from those of traditional monolayer cell cultures. The generation and maturation of high-fidelity organoids entails developing and optimizing environmental conditions to provide the optimal cues for growth and 3D maturation, such as oxygenation, mechanical and fluidic activation, nutrition gradients, etc. To this end, we discuss the four main categories of bioreactors used for organoid culture: stirred bioreactors (SBR), microfluidic bioreactors (MFB), rotating wall vessels (RWV), and electrically stimulating (ES) bioreactors. We aim to lay out the state-of-the-art of both commercial and in-house developed bioreactor systems, their benefits to the culture of organoids derived from various cells and tissues, and the limitations of bioreactor technology, including sterilization, accessibility, and suitability and ease of use for long-term culture. Finally, we discuss future directions for improvements to existing bioreactor technology and how they may be used to enhance organoid culture for specific applications.",Licata JP; Schwab KH; Har-El YE; Gerstenhaber JA; Lelkes PI,3D printing; biomimetic; differentiation; embryoid body; metabolism; pluripotent; simulated microgravity; spheroid; stem cell; stimulation,2023,International journal of molecular sciences,Journal Article; Review,80NSSC18K1480/NASA/NASA/United States,

Tissue construction from PDL-derived cells could be considered as a valuable technique for periodontal regenerative medicine. On these basis, we determined the role of CEMP1 (cementum protein 1) as a factor to induce differentiation of human PDL cells in a 3D (three-dimensional) fashion. Human PDL cells were grown in an RCCS (rotary cell culture system) D-410 RWV (rotating wall vessel) bioreactor, and maintained in either experimental (CEMP1 2.5 μg/ml) or control media during 4 weeks. Cell proliferation in the presence of CEMP1 was determined. The tissue-like structure formed was analysed histologically, stained with Alizarin Red and Alcian Blue. ALP (alkaline phosphatase)-specific activity, immunostaining, RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) and Western blotting were performed to determine the expression of BSP (bone sialoprotein), enamel [AMBN (ameloblastin) and AMEL (amelogenin)], cementum [CAP (cementum attachment protein) and CEMP1] and cartilage-related proteins (Sox9, aggrecan, types II and X collagens). Our results show that hrCEMP1 (human recombinant CEMP1) promoted cell proliferation by human PDL cells in 3D cultures and induced the formation of a tissue-like structure resembling bone and/or cementum and material similar to cartilage. The addition of hrCEMP1 to the 3D human PDL cell cultures increased ALP-specific activity by 2.0-fold and induced the expression of markers for the osteogenic, cementogenic and chondrogenic phenotypes at the mRNA and protein levels. Our data show that human PDL cells in 3D cultures with the addition of CEMP1 has the potential to be used for the bioengineering reconstruction of periodontal tissues and cartilage since our results suggest that CEMP1 stimulates human PDL cells to differentiate towards different phenotypes.",Hoz L; Romo E; Zeichner-David M; Sanz M; Nuñez J; Gaitán L; Mercado G; Arzate H,,2012,Cell biology international,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",DE019792/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,16610381,Use of fluoroscopy to evaluate iliac screw position.,"Iliac screw fixation is often used for long fusions to the sacropelvis. Maximum iliac screw purchase is obtained both by placing the screws within 1.5 cm of the greater sciatic notch and by extending them anterior to the axis of rotation in flexion-extension. Screw insertion is ""blinded"" or dependent on tactile feedback, and hence extreme care is necessary to avoid incorrect placement and damage to vital neurovascular structures in the pelvis and sciatic notch. Long screws may violate the hip joint while medial placement may injure the lumbosacral plexus and the nearby vessels. To explore the best intraoperative fluoroscopic method of determining optimal iliac screw placement, we used a synthetic pelvis model to investigate screw placement conditions: (1) optimal anatomic placement, (2) violation of the sciatic notch, (3) hip joint violation, (4) medial wall violation, and (5) lateral wall violation. Each condition was examined utilizing fluoroscopy with posteroanterior, inlet, outlet, lateral, iliac oblique, and obturator oblique Judet views to simulate operative conditions. These views were obtained to evaluate critical malposition of iliac screws. We found that, for a sciatic notch violation, the obturator oblique view best demonstrated the cortical breech, while for a hip joint violation, the inlet and outlet views were best. For a medial wall violation, the iliac oblique view best showed the violation. For a lateral wall violation, we were unable to demonstrate the cortical breech using these fluoroscopic views. Fluoroscopy is an effective method to determine sciatic notch, hip joint, and medial wall violations after iliac screw placement; however, it is not effective in identifying a lateral wall violation.",Orchowski JR; Polly DW Jr; Kuklo TR; Klemme WR; Schroeder TM,,2006,"American journal of orthopedics (Belle Mead, N.J.)","Comparative Study; Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,19928093,Detectability of motions in AAA with ECG-gated CTA: a quantitative study.,"PURPOSE: ECG-gated CT enables the visualization of motions caused by the beating of the heart. Although ECG gating is frequently used in cardiac CT imaging, this technique is also very promising for evaluating vessel wall motion of the aortic artery and the motions of (stent grafts inside) abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Late stent graft failure is a serious complication in endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms. Better understanding of the motion characteristics of stent grafts will be beneficial for designing future devices. In addition, these data can be valuable in predicting stent graft failure in patients. To be able to reliably quantify the motion, however, it is of importance to know the performance and limitations of ECG gating, especially when the motions are small, as is the case in AAA. Since the details of the reconstruction algorithms are proprietary information on the CT manufacturers and not in the public domain, empirical experiments are required. The goal of this study is to investigate as to what extent the motions in AAA can be measured using ECG-gated CT. The authors quantitatively investigate four aspects of motion in ECG-gated CT: The detectability of the motion of objects at different amplitudes and different periodic motions, the temporal resolution, and the volume gaps that occur as a function of heart rate. METHODS: They designed an experiment on a standard static phantom to empirically determine temporal resolution. To investigate motion amplitude and frequency, as well as patient heart rate, they designed dynamic experiments in which a home-made phantom driven by a motion unit moves in a predetermined pattern. RESULTS: The duration of each ECG-gated phase was found to be 185 ms, which corresponds to half of the rotation time and is thus in accordance with half scan reconstruction applied by the scanner. By using subpixel localization, motions become detectable from amplitudes of as small as 0.4 mm in the x direction and 0.7 mm in the z direction. With the rotation time used in this study, motions up to 2.7 Hz can be reliably detected. The reconstruction algorithm fills volume gaps with noisy data using interpolation, but objects within these gaps remain hidden. CONCLUSIONS: This study gives insight into the possibilities and limitations for measuring small motions using ECG-gated CT. Application of the experimental method is not restricted to the CT scanner of a single manufacturer. From the results, they conclude that ECG-gated CTA is a suitable technique for studying the expected motions of the stent graft and vessel wall in AAA.",Klein A; Oostveen LJ; Greuter MJ; Hoogeveen Y; Kool LJ; Slump CH; Renema WK,,2009,Medical physics,Evaluation Study; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,31261119,A review on the reliability of hemodynamic modeling in intracranial aneurysms: why computational fluid dynamics alone cannot solve the equation.,"Computational blood flow modeling in intracranial aneurysms (IAs) has enormous potential for the assessment of highly resolved hemodynamics and derived wall stresses. This results in an improved knowledge in important research fields, such as rupture risk assessment and treatment optimization. However, due to the requirement of assumptions and simplifications, its applicability in a clinical context remains limited.This review article focuses on the main aspects along the interdisciplinary modeling chain and highlights the circumstance that computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are embedded in a multiprocess workflow. These aspects include imaging-related steps, the setup of realistic hemodynamic simulations, and the analysis of multidimensional computational results. To condense the broad knowledge, specific recommendations are provided at the end of each subsection.Overall, various individual substudies exist in the literature that have evaluated relevant technical aspects. In this regard, the importance of precise vessel segmentations for the simulation outcome is emphasized. Furthermore, the accuracy of the computational model strongly depends on the specific research question. Additionally, standardization in the context of flow analysis is required to enable an objective comparison of research findings and to avoid confusion within the medical community. Finally, uncertainty quantification and validation studies should always accompany numerical investigations.In conclusion, this review aims for an improved awareness among physicians regarding potential sources of error in hemodynamic modeling for IAs. Although CFD is a powerful methodology, it cannot provide reliable information, if pre- and postsimulation steps are inaccurately carried out. From this, future studies can be critically evaluated and real benefits can be differentiated from results that have been acquired based on technically inaccurate procedures.",Berg P; Saalfeld S; Voß S; Beuing O; Janiga G,3DRA = 3D rotational angiography; CFD = computational fluid dynamics; IA = intracranial aneurysm; computational fluid dynamics; imaging; intracranial aneurysms; segmentation; uncertainty quantification,2019,Neurosurgical focus,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",,
rotating_wall,19087514,[Clinical anatomic study on minimal invasive sling procedures of female pelvic floor].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the route of minimal invasive sling procedures and evaluate their safety. METHODS: Tension-free vaginal tape (TVT), TVT-obturator (TVT-O) and posterior intravaginal sling (P-IVS) procedure were performed on five fresh pelvis. 4% formaldehyde was used to preserve the cadavers and colored latex was injected into the vessels. An anatomic study and measurements between the trocars and related vessels or organs were carried out. RESULTS: There was no complication during all injections. The distance between TVT trocar and pubic vessels, the bladder, external iliac vessels and obturator vessels were 0.6, 0.6, 4.2 and 4.3 cm, respectively. Out of control of TVT trocar, the axial rotation or lateral diversion of TVT handle could injure these structures. We found during TVT-O operation, the retropubic space was not violated. The right placement of introducer was very important. When the beginning point was too deep into the anterior vaginal wall, 2.2 cm proximal to urethral meatus or on a horizontal plane with a 35 degrees angle relative to the urethral sagittal plane, the introducer would enter the retropubic space or perforate the upper posterior zone of the obturator membrane, where the obturator vessels and nerves exit the obturator canal. Based on our study, the diversion of P-IVS trocar would damage the rectum, and the pudendal vessels and nerves were relatively safe. CONCLUSIONS: The TVT trocar passes the retropubic space and may injure the important vessels or organs. The route of TVT-O inside-out operation is stable and the retropubic space is not violated. The blunt design in the P-IVS trocar tips is helpful to reduce injury.",Wang W; Lang JH; Zhu L,,2008,Zhonghua fu chan ke za zhi,English Abstract; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,35711662,Spaceflight Analogue Culture Enhances the Host-Pathogen Interaction Between Salmonella and a 3-D Biomimetic Intestinal Co-Culture Model.,"Physical forces associated with spaceflight and spaceflight analogue culture regulate a wide range of physiological responses by both bacterial and mammalian cells that can impact infection. However, our mechanistic understanding of how these environments regulate host-pathogen interactions in humans is poorly understood. Using a spaceflight analogue low fluid shear culture system, we investigated the effect of Low Shear Modeled Microgravity (LSMMG) culture on the colonization of Salmonella Typhimurium in a 3-D biomimetic model of human colonic epithelium containing macrophages. RNA-seq profiling of stationary phase wild type and Δhfq mutant bacteria alone indicated that LSMMG culture induced global changes in gene expression in both strains and that the RNA binding protein Hfq played a significant role in regulating the transcriptional response of the pathogen to LSMMG culture. However, a core set of genes important for adhesion, invasion, and motility were commonly induced in both strains. LSMMG culture enhanced the colonization (adherence, invasion and intracellular survival) of Salmonella in this advanced model of intestinal epithelium using a mechanism that was independent of Hfq. Although S. Typhimurium Δhfq mutants are normally defective for invasion when grown as conventional shaking cultures, LSMMG conditions unexpectedly enabled high levels of colonization by an isogenic Δhfq mutant. In response to infection with either the wild type or mutant, host cells upregulated transcripts involved in inflammation, tissue remodeling, and wound healing during intracellular survival. Interestingly, infection by the Δhfq mutant led to fewer transcriptional differences between LSMMG- and control-infected host cells relative to infection with the wild type strain. This is the first study to investigate the effect of LSMMG culture on the interaction between S. Typhimurium and a 3-D model of human intestinal tissue. These findings advance our understanding of how physical forces can impact the early stages of human enteric salmonellosis.

An in vitro model for NoV replication remains elusive, making study of the virus difficult. A previous study, which used a 3-dimensional (3-D) intestinal model derived from INT-407 cells reported NoV replication and extensive cytopathic effects (CPE). Using the same 3-D model, but with highly purified Norwalk virus (NV), we attempted to replicate this study. Our results showed no evidence of NV replication by real-time PCR of viral RNA or by immunocytochemical detection of viral structural and nonstructural proteins. Immunocytochemical analysis of the 3-D cultures also showed no detectable presence of histo-blood group antigens that participate in NV binding and host tropism. To determine the potential cause of CPE observed in the previous study, we exposed 3-D cultures to lipopolysaccharide concentrations consistent with contaminated stool samples and observed morphologic features similar to CPE.

Research in space under microgravity (µg) conditions is a novel approach with the potential to fight cancer and develop future cancer therapies. Space travel is accompanied by adverse effects on our health, and there is a need to counteract these health problems.

METHODS: After completing 50 cases with RA prior to beta-radiation (Group I), we performed optimal balloon angioplasty followed by beta-radiation in the next 53 consecutive patients (Group II) for the treatment of diffuse ISR. The radiation dose was 15 Gy at a depth of 1.0 mm into the vessel wall. RESULTS: The baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics were similar between the two groups. The mean length of the lesion was 25.6+/-12.7 mm in Group I and 22.9+/-8.6 mm in Group II (p=0.26). Radiation was successfully delivered to all patients, with a mean irradiation time of 179+/-55 s. The 6-month angiographic restenosis rate was 10% (5/50) in Group I versus 33% (17/51) in Group II (p=0.007). No adverse event including myocardial infarction, death, or stent thrombosis occurred during the 1-year follow-up period. The risk of a target lesion revascularization or a major adverse cardiac event was significantly lower in Group I than in Group II (two patients in Group I vs. nine patients in Group II; OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.04-0.96; p=0.04).

METHODS: CTA and 3-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA) of 3 IAs in 2 patients were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Hemodynamics and morphological parameters were compared between a ruptured IA and an unruptured IA in case1, and between before and after aneurysm rupture in case 2. RESULTS: In case 1, the ruptured aneurysm had larger morphological parameters including size ratio (SR), aspect ratio (AR), aneurysm vessel angle (θ(F)), Aneurysm inclination angle (θ(A)), Undulation index (UI), Ellipticity index (EI), and Non-sphericity Index (NSI) than the unruptured aneurysm. And oscillatory shear index (OSI) is also larger. Higher rupture resemblance score (RRS) was shown in the ruptured aneurysm. In case 2, the aneurysm had one daughter sac after 2 years. Partial morphological and hemodynamic parameters including SR, AR, θ(F), θ(A), UI, EI, NSI, OSI, and relative residence time (RRT) increased, and normalized wall shear stress (NWSS) was significantly reduced. RRS increased during this period. CONCLUSION: SR and OSI may have predictive values for the risk of intracranial aneurysm rupture. It is possible that WSS Changes before and after IA rupture, yet the influence of high or low WSS on growth and rupture of IA remains unclear.

rotating_wall,32047838,Spaceflight and simulated microgravity conditions increase virulence of Serratia marcescens in the Drosophila melanogaster infection model.,"While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll, suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized. foreign copyright protection may apply 2020.",Gilbert R; Torres M; Clemens R; Hateley S; Hosamani R; Wade W; Bhattacharya S,Infection; Innate immunity; Microbiology,2020,NPJ microgravity,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,25030964,Simulated microgravity affects chondrogenesis and hypertrophy of human mesenchymal stem cells.,"PURPOSE: During in vitro chondrogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) hypertrophy is an inadvertent event associated with cell differentiation toward the osteogenic lineage. Up to now, there is no stringent experimental control mechanism to prevent hypertrophy of MSCs. Microgravity is known to have an impact on osteogenesis. In this study, the influence of simulated microgravity (SMG) on both chondrogenesis and hypertrophy of hMSCs was evaluated. METHODS: A bioreactor using a rotating wall vessel was constructed to simulate microgravity. Pellet cultures formed from hMSCs (P5) were supplemented with human transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3). The hMSC pellet cultures treated with TGF-β3 were either kept in SMG or in a control system. After three weeks of culture, the chondrogenic differentiation status and level of hypertrophy were examined by safranin-O staining, immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: SMG reduced the staining for safranin-O and collagen type II. The expression of collagen type X α1 chain (COL10A1) and collagen type II α1 chain (COL2A1) were both significantly reduced. There was a higher decrease in COL2A1 than in COL10A1 expression, resulting in a low COL2A1/COL10A1 ratio. CONCLUSIONS: SMG reduced hypertrophy of hMSCs during chondrogenic differentiation. However, the expression of COL2A1 was likewise reduced. Even more, the COL2A1/COL10A1 ratio decreased under SMG conditions. We therefore assume that SMG has a significant impact on the chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs. However, due to the high COL2A1 suppression under SMG, this culture system does not yet seem to be suitable for a potential application in cartilage repair.",Mayer-Wagner S; Hammerschmid F; Redeker JI; Schmitt B; Holzapfel BM; Jansson V; Betz OB; Müller PE,,2014,International orthopaedics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Nucleated cells (NC) and CD34+ cells had a 435.5 +/- 87.6 fold expansion and a 32.7 +/- 15.6 fold expansion respectively in 197 h, and CFU-GM (colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage) cells had a 21.7 +/- 4.9 fold expansion. In the whole course of culture, the pH and osmolality of the medium in the RWV were kept in the optimal hematopoietic stem cells' expansion conditions. pH was kept from 7.2 to 7.4, and the osmolality was kept from 290 mmol/kg to 310 mmol/kg. Owing to its structural particularity, the RWV could ensure cells to grow in the suspension state, could simulate the micro-environment of umbilical cord blood, and thus could make the hematopoietic stem cells expand largely in the RWV in short time.",Fan X; Bao C; Liu Y; Liu T; Sun X; Ge D; Ma X,,2007,Sheng wu yi xue gong cheng xue za zhi = Journal of biomedical engineering =,"English Abstract; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,19081771,Effect of simulated microgravity on oxidation-sensitive gene expression in PC12 cells.,"Oxygen utilization by and oxygen dependence of cellular processes may be different in biological systems that are exposed to microgravity (micro-g). A baseline in which cellular changes in oxygen sensitive molecular processes occur during micro-g conditions would be important to pursue this question. The objective of this research is to analyze oxidation-sensitive gene expression in a model cell line [rat pheochromocytoma (PC12)] under simulated micro-g conditions. The PC12 cell line is well characterized in its response to oxygen, and is widely recognized as a sensitive model for studying the responses of oxygen-sensitive molecular and cellular processes. This study uses the rotating wall vessel bioreactor (RWV) designed at NASA to simulate micro-g. Gene expression in PC12 cells in response to micro-g was analyzed by DNA microarray technology. The microarray analysis of PC12 cells cultured for 4 days under simulated micro-g under standardized oxygen environment conditions revealed more than 100 genes whose expression levels were changed at least twofold (up-regulation of 65 genes and down-regulation of 39 genes) compared with those from cells in the unit gravity (unit-g) control. This study observed that genes involved in the oxidoreductase activity category were most significantly differentially expressed under micro-g conditions. Also, known oxidation-sensitive transcription factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha, c-myc, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma were changed significantly. Our initial results from the gene expression microarray studies may provide a context in which to evaluate the effect of varying oxygen environments on the background of differential gene regulation of biological processes under variable gravity conditions.",Kwon O; Sartor M; Tomlinson CR; Millard RW; Olah ME; Sankovic JM; Banerjee RK,,2006,Advances in space research : the official journal of the Committee on Space,Journal Article,P30 ES006096-08/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States,

Microgravity may induce and select some microorganisms for physiological, metabolic, and/or genetic variations. This study was conducted to determine the effects of simulated microgravity conditions on the metabolism and gene expression of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17938. To investigate microbial response to simulated microgravity, two devices-the rotating wall vessel (RWV) and the random positioning machine (RPM)-were used. Microbial growth, reuterin production, and resistance to gastrointestinal passage were assessed, and morphological characteristics were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. The expression of some selected genes that are responsive to stress conditions and to bile salts stress was evaluated through real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Monitoring of bacterial growth, cell size, and shape under simulated microgravity did not reveal differences compared with 1 × g controls. On the contrary, an enhanced production of reuterin and a greater tolerance to the gastrointestinal passage were observed. Moreover, some stress genes were upregulated under RWV conditions, especially after 24 h of treatment, whereas RPM conditions seemed to determine a downregulation over time of the same stress genes. These results show that simulated microgravity could alter some physiological characteristics of L. reuteri DSM17938 with regard to tolerance toward stress conditions encountered on space missions and could be useful to elucidate the adaptation mechanisms of microbes to the space environment.",Senatore G; Mastroleo F; Leys N; Mauriello G,Antimicrobial compound; Gastrointestinal passage; Microgravity; Probiotic bacteria; RPM; RWV,2020,Astrobiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of mixing culture medium on the spatial composition of spheroids prepared from well (LNCaP) and poorly (DU 145) differentiated human prostate cancer cells. Spheroids were cultured in a mixed suspension within a high-aspect rotating wall vessel and static liquid-overlay plate. Results from this study demonstrate that mixed cultures consistently manifested differences in morphology and composition between DU 145 and LNCaP spheroids. For example, 40 +/- 12% of DU 145 cells were Ki-67 positive 100 microm from the surface within mixed spheroids versus 0% for LNCaP cells; there was no significant difference in this spatial profile for static cultures. The results suggest that poorly differentiated spheroids may be more likely to experience a change in composition from mixing culture medium than well-differentiated spheroids, due to low tissue density. Immunostaining for P-glycoprotein is representative of this trend; average staining intensity increased 50% for DU 145 spheroids on mixing but was unchanged for LNCaP spheroids. The effects of mixing on spheroid composition were attributed to faster interstitial mass transport.

Management options for T2EL include transarterial embolization, direct puncture (DP), or transcaval embolization. We report the case of an 80-year-old man with T2EL who successfully underwent DP embolization. METHODS: Embolization by DP was performed with a transpedicular approach using an isocenter puncture (ISOP) method. An isocenter marker (ICM) was placed at a site corresponding to the aneurysm sac on fluoroscopy in two directions (frontal and lateral views). A vertebroplasty needle was inserted tangentially to the ICM under fluoroscopy and advanced to the anterior wall of the vertebral body. A 20 cm-length, 20-G-PTCD needle was inserted through the outer needle of the 13-G needle and advanced to the ICM. Sac embolization using 25 % N-buty-2-cyanoacrylate diluted with Lipiodol was performed. After complete embolization, rotational DA confirmed good filling of the sac with Lipiodol. The outer cannula and 13-G needle were removed and the procedure was completed. RESULTS: The patient was discharged the next day. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography 1 and 8 months later showed no Lipiodol washout in the aneurysm sac, no endoleak recurrence, and no expansion of the excluded aneurysm. CONCLUSION: DP with a transpedicular approach using ISOP may be useful when translumbar and transabdominal approaches prove difficult.",Ogawa Y; Hamaguchi S; Nishimaki H; Kon Y; Chiba K; Sakurai Y; Murakami K; Arai Y; Miyairi T; Nakajima Y,,2015,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,Case Reports; Journal Article,,

Our results show that 42 miRNAs were differentially expressed in MMG-incubated PBLs compared with 1 g incubated ones. Among these, miR-9-5p, miR-9-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-3p, and miR-378-3p were the most dysregulated. To improve the detection of functional miRNA-mRNA pairs, we performed gene expression profiles on the same samples assayed for miRNA profiling and we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression data. The functional classification of miRNA-correlated genes evidenced significant enrichment in the biological processes of immune/inflammatory response, signal transduction, regulation of response to stress, regulation of programmed cell death, and regulation of cell proliferation. We identified the correlation of miR-9-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-3p, and miR-378-3p expression with that of genes involved in immune/inflammatory response (e.g., IFNG and IL17F), apoptosis (e.g., PDCD4 and PTEN), and cell proliferation (e.g., NKX3-1 and GADD45A). Experimental assays of cell viability and apoptosis induction validated the results obtained by bioinformatics analyses demonstrating that in human PBLs the exposure to reduced gravitational force increases the frequency of apoptosis and decreases cell proliferation.",Girardi C; De Pittà C; Casara S; Calura E; Romualdi C; Celotti L; Mognato M,,2014,BioMed research international,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,23159673,Replication of hepatitis E virus in three-dimensional cell culture.,"Hepatitis E is an acute, viral hepatitis epidemic in developing regions, but which is detected with increasing frequency in sporadic form in developed regions. Pigs and possibly some other mammals are considered reservoirs of zoonotic infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV). However, whilst the relative significance of potential transmission routes from pigs to people is still unclear, the consumption of raw or undercooked pig meat has been implicated as a source of HEV infection. The lack of information about HEV zoonotic transmission is due in part to the difficulties of in vitro propagation of HEV. The Rotating Wall Vessel (RVW) has been described as a useful tool for the culture of cell lines in a 3-dimensional (3D) configuration. The aim of this work was to develop a 3D cell culture system for HEV to facilitate studies into the viability of virions contaminating pig tissues. This study, demonstrated that HEV can replicate efficiently in the RWV in human hepatoblastoma PLC/PRF/5 cells for up to 5 months not only by real time RT-PCR but also by detection of complete virions via electron microscopy. Furthermore, the replication of HEV progeny was observed by detecting HEV RNA by RT-PCR. The progeny were able to infect fresh 3D cultures, showing that this method is able to produce infectious hepatitis E virions.",Berto A; Van der Poel WH; Hakze-van der Honing R; Martelli F; La Ragione RM; Inglese N; Collins J; Grierson S; Johne R; Reetz J; Dastjerdi A; Banks M,,2013,Journal of virological methods,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,16927271,Modeled microgravity stimulates osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by increasing osteoblast RANKL/OPG ratio.,"Mechanical unloading causes detrimental effects on the skeleton, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. We investigated the effect of microgravity on osteoblast ability to regulate osteoclastogenesis. Mouse osteoblast primary cultures were grown for 24 h at unit gravity or under simulated microgravity, using the NASA-developed Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor. Conditioned media (CM) from osteoblasts subjected to microgravity increased osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in mouse bone marrow cultures. In these osteoblasts, the RANKL/OPG ratio was higher relative to 1g. Consistently, treatment with high concentrations of OPG-inhibited osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in the presence of CM arising from osteoblasts cultured under microgravity. Microgravity failed to affect osteoblast differentiation and function in the time frame of the experiment, as we found no effect on alkaline phosphatase mRNA and activity, nor on Runx2, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and collagen1A2 mRNA expression. In contrast, microgravity induced a time dependent increase of ERK-1/2 phosphorylation, while phospho-p38 and phospho-JNK remained unchanged. Apoptosis, revealed by bis-benzimide staining, was similar among the various gravity conditions, while it was increased under microgravity after treatment with the MEK-1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, suggesting a protection role by ERK-1/2 against cell death. In conclusion, microgravity is capable to indirectly stimulate osteoclast formation and activity by regulating osteoblast secretion of crucial regulatory factors such as RANKL and OPG. We hypothesize that this mechanism could contribute to bone loss in individuals subjected to weightlessness and other unloading conditions.",Rucci N; Rufo A; Alamanou M; Teti A,,2007,Journal of cellular biochemistry,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,37323615,Reynolds number scaling and energy spectra in geostrophic convection.,"We report flow measurements in rotating Rayleigh-Bénard convection in the rotationally-constrained geostrophic regime. We apply stereoscopic particle image velocimetry to measure the three components of velocity in a horizontal cross-section of a water-filled cylindrical convection vessel. At a constant, small Ekman number Ek = 5 × 10(-8) we vary the Rayleigh number Ra between 10(11) and 4 × 10(12) to cover various subregimes observed in geostrophic convection. We also include one nonrotating experiment. The scaling of the velocity fluctuations (expressed as the Reynolds number Re) is compared to theoretical relations expressing balances of viscous-Archimedean-Coriolis (VAC) and Coriolis-inertial-Archimedean (CIA) forces. Based on our results we cannot decide which balance is most applicable here; both scaling relations match equally well. A comparison of the current data with several other literature datasets indicates a convergence towards diffusion-free scaling of velocity as Ek decreases. However, the use of confined domains leads at lower Ra to prominent convection in the wall mode near the sidewall. Kinetic energy spectra point at an overall flow organisation into a quadrupolar vortex filling the cross-section. This quadrupolar vortex is a quasi-two-dimensional feature; it only manifests in energy spectra based on the horizontal velocity components. At larger Ra the spectra reveal the development of a scaling range with exponent close to -5/3, the classical exponent for inertial-range scaling in three-dimensional turbulence. The steeper Re(Ra) scaling at low Ek and development of a scaling range in the energy spectra are distinct indicators that a fully developed, diffusion-free turbulent bulk flow state is approached, sketching clear perspectives for further investigation.",Madonia M; Guzmán AJA; Clercx HJH; Kunnen RPJ,,2023,Journal of fluid mechanics,Journal Article,,

We performed global transcriptome analysis of mouse calvarial osteoblasts grown for 5 days at unit gravity (1g) or under modeled microgravity (0.008g) in the NASA-developed rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Elaboration of gene profiling data evidenced that, among the >20,000 gene probes evaluated, 45 genes were significantly up-regulated (cut-off >2) and 88 were down-regulated (cut-off <0.5) in modeled microgravity versus 1g. This set of regulated genes includes genes involved in osteoblast differentiation, function, and osteoblast-osteoclast cross-talk, as well as new genes not previously correlated with bone metabolism. Microarray data were validated for subsets of genes by real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, or functional analysis. The significantly modulated genes were then clustered using the GOTM (Gene Ontology Tree Machine) software. This analysis evidenced up-regulation of genes involved in the induction of apoptosis, in response to stress and in the activity of selected growth factors. Other molecular functions, such as extracellular matrix structural constituent, glycosaminoglycan/heparin-binding activity, and other growth factor activity, were instead down-regulated. We finally matched our transcriptome results with other public global gene profiles obtained in loading and unloading conditions, identifying 10 shared regulated genes which could represent an ""osteoblast mechanoresponsive gene signature.""",Capulli M; Rufo A; Teti A; Rucci N,,2009,Journal of cellular biochemistry,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

The aim of this study was to assess the osteogenic differentiation potential of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (hPDLFs) in three dimensional (3D)-osteogenic culture environment following encapsulation in chitosan-hydroxyapatite (C/HA) microspheres with the size range of 350-450 microm. Human PDLF cultures were established and three experimental groups were formed: (i) two-dimensional (2D)-culture as single cell monolayer, (ii) 3D-static culture of C/HA encapsulated hPDLFs, and (iii) 3D-dynamic culture of C/HA encapsulated hPDLFs in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor. The cells were cultured in standard culture medium supplemented with beta-glycerophosphate, dexamethasone, and ascorbic acid. After 21 days, immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against osteonectin, osteopontin, bone-sialoprotein, and osteocalcin as osteogenic differentiation markers. Phase-contrast and scanning electron microscopy observations were used for histological and morphological evaluation. The combined effects of osteoinductive medium and HA-containing composite microsphere material on encapsulated hPDLFs resulted in the transformation of a considerable portion of the cells into osteoblastic lineage at the end of the experiments. Results demonstrate the ability of hPDLFs to undergo osteogenic differentiation upon induction in vitro, both under 2D and 3D culture conditions. C/HA microspheres in microgravity bioreactor may serve as a suitable 3D environment to support the osteogenic differentiation of human PDLFs, in vitro.",Inanç B; Eser Elçin A; Koç A; Baloş K; Parlar A; Murat Elçin Y,,2007,Journal of biomedical materials research.

rotating_wall,10195345,Progressive maturation resistance to microcystin-LR cytotoxicity in two different hepatospheroidal models.,"To develop three-dimensional (3D) cytotoxicity models further, microcystin-induced cytoskeletal disruption was tested in two different models of multicellular hepatocyte aggregate formation (hepatospheroids). Rat hepatocyte suspensions were seeded either onto poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate)-treated culture wells (poly-HEMA) or in a rotating wall vessel (RWV) device which provides minimal shear forces and enhances differentiated 3D growth. Ninety percent of spheroids forming on poly-HEMA tended to fuse and form nonhomogeneous multilobular structures by day 4 of incubation. In contrast, spheroids cultured in the low-shear environment formed homogeneous aggregates that averaged 126 + 10 microm diameter in size at day 7. Microcystin-LR (10(-6) mol/L) was put into contact (90 min in serum-free medium) with hepatocyte suspensions and spheroids formed in both systems for 1, 4 or 7 days. As already described, microcystin-LR (after 90 min), induced cytoskeletal disruptions (blebs) in 98% of the isolated primary hepatocytes maintained in suspension. In 3D cultures, blebs were detected only on poly-HEMA nonhomogeneous early prespheroids. All other mature spheroids (poly-HEMA or RWV) exposed to the toxin did not exhibit obvious morphological signs of toxicity. Moreover, microcystin-LR pre-incubation with hepatocyte suspension prevented the formation of conventional spheroids. In conclusion, the low-shear, simulated-microgravity environment generated high yields of regularly engineered spheroids. In both models, progressive resistance of mature spheroids to microcystin-LR-induced cell deformation developed with time in culture. Microcystin-LR inhibition of the formation of rat hepatospheroids in isolated hepatocyte suspension could be used as a complementary biological assay for detection of the presence of biologically active microcystin-LR in water samples.",Battle T; Maguire T; Moulsdale H; Doyle A,,1999,Cell biology and toxicology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

We present a method for contrast-enhanced C-arm CBCT that provides detailed and simultaneous visualization of neurovascular stents and host arteries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CBCT was performed with a rotational angiography system by acquiring 620 projection frames over a 200° arc at 80 kVp and a total of 260 mAs. A superselective intra-arterial contrast injection protocol was optimized in swine experiments and implemented in 57 clinical examinations. High-resolution 3D reconstructions were evaluated by 3 blinded interventional neuroradiologists. Reviewers rated the images by answering questions related to both the quality of the stent and artery visualization and the clinical utility of the images. Raw agreement statistics, ICC, and κ statistics were computed for the questionnaire results. RESULTS: Of 57 clinical evaluations, 5 were not evaluated due to the use of large balloon-mounted stents (n = 4) and a failed contrast injection (n = 1). In 50 of 52 evaluated examinations, the reviewers agreed that simultaneous stent and vessel visualization was of diagnostic quality. There was strong agreement that stent-vessel wall apposition could be assessed (κ = 0.79). CBCT detected contrast filling defects (κ = 0.85) and vascular calcification (κ = 0.68). Artifacts resulting from the aneurysm coil mass impaired the delineation of adjacent structures (κ = 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a technique that enables simultaneous clinically useful imaging of neurovascular stents and their host arteries that is unobtainable with other current imaging modalities.

This three-dimensional (3-D) vaginal model provides a platform for high-throughput toxicity testing of candidate microbicides targeted to combat sexually transmitted infections, effectively complementing and extending existing testing systems such as surgical explants or animal models. Vaginal ECs were grown on porous, collagen-coated microcarrier beads in a rotating, low fluid-shear environment; use of RWV bioreactor technology generated 3-D vaginal EC aggregates. Immunofluorescence and scanning and transmission electron microscopy confirmed differentiation and polarization of the 3-D EC aggregates among multiple cell layers and identified ultrastructural features important for nutrient absorption, cell-cell interactions, and pathogen defense. After treatment with a variety of toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, cytokine production was quantified by cytometric bead array, confirming that TLRs 2, 3, 5, and 6 were expressed and functional. The 3-D vaginal aggregates were more resistant to nonoxynol-9 (N-9), a contraceptive and previous microbicide candidate, when compared to two-dimensional monolayers of the same cell line. A dose-dependent production of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, biomarkers of cervicovaginal inflammation, correlated to microbicide toxicity in the 3-D model following N-9 treatment.

We have shown that biaxial rotating (BXR) bioreactor-matured human fetal mesenchymal stem cell (hfMSC) mediated-TEBG can heal a rat critical sized femoral defect. However, it is not known whether optimal bioreactors exist for bone TE (BTE) applications. We systematically compared this BXR bioreactor with three most commonly used systems: Spinner Flask (SF), Perfusion and Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactors, for their application in BTE. The BXR bioreactor achieved higher levels of cellularity and confluence (1.4-2.5x, p < 0.05) in large 785 mm(3) macroporous scaffolds not achieved in the other bioreactors operating in optimal settings. BXR bioreactor-treated scaffolds experienced earlier and more robust osteogenic differentiation on von Kossa staining, ALP induction (1.2-1.6×, p < 0.01) and calcium deposition (1.3-2.3×, p < 0.01). We developed a Micro CT quantification method which demonstrated homogenous distribution of hfMSC in BXR bioreactor-treated grafts, but not with the other three.

rotating_wall,35913142,Role of RpoS in Regulating Stationary Phase Salmonella Typhimurium Pathogenesis-Related Stress Responses under Physiological Low Fluid Shear Force Conditions.,"The discovery that biomechanical forces regulate microbial virulence was established with the finding that physiological low fluid shear (LFS) forces altered gene expression, stress responses, and virulence of the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium during the log phase. These log phase LFS-induced phenotypes were independent of the master stress response regulator, RpoS (σ(S)). Given the central importance of RpoS in regulating stationary-phase stress responses of S. Typhimurium cultured under conventional shake flask and static conditions, we examined its role in stationary-phase cultures grown under physiological LFS. We constructed an isogenic rpoS mutant derivative of wild-type S. Typhimurium and compared the ability of these strains to survive in vitro pathogenesis-related stresses that mimic those encountered in the infected host and environment. We also compared the ability of these strains to colonize (adhere, invade, and survive within) human intestinal epithelial cell cultures. Unexpectedly, LFS-induced resistance of stationary-phase S. Typhimurium cultures to acid and bile salts stresses did not rely on RpoS. Likewise, RpoS was dispensable for stationary-phase LFS cultures to adhere to and survive within intestinal epithelial cells. In contrast, the resistance of these cultures to challenges of oxidative and thermal stresses, and their invasion into intestinal epithelial cells was influenced by RpoS. These findings expand our mechanistic understanding of how physiological fluid shear forces modulate stationary-phase S. Typhimurium physiology in unexpected ways and provide clues into microbial mechanobiology and nuances of Salmonella responses to microenvironmental niches in the infected host. IMPORTANCE Bacterial pathogens respond dynamically to a variety of stresses in the infected host, including physical forces of fluid flow (fluid shear) across their surfaces. While pathogens experience wide fluctuations in fluid shear during infection, little is known about how these forces regulate microbial pathogenesis. This is especially important for stationary-phase bacterial growth, which is a critical period to understand microbial resistance, survival, and infection potential, and is regulated in many bacteria by the general stationary-phase stress response protein RpoS. Here, we showed that, unlike conventional culture conditions, several stationary-phase Salmonella pathogenic stress responses were not impacted by RpoS when bacteria were cultured under fluid shear conditions relevant to those encountered in the intestine of the infected host. These findings offer new insight into how physiological fluid shear forces encountered by Salmonella during infection might impact pathogenic responses in unexpected ways that are relevant to their disease-causing ability.",Franco Meléndez K; Crenshaw K; Barrila J; Yang J; Gangaraju S; Davis RR; Forsyth RJ; Ott CM; Kader R; Curtiss R 3rd; Roland K; Nickerson CA,RpoS; Salmonella; acid stress; bile salt stress; biomechanical forces; fluid shear; infection; intestinal epithelium; mechanobiology; mechanotransduction; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; rotating wall vessel; sigma factor; stationary-phase; stress responses; thermal stress; σ38 (sigma 38); σS (sigma S),2022,mSphere,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Although the majority of such defects could be repaired with the use of local and regional musculocutaneous flaps, more complicated cases require increasingly sophisticated reconstructive techniques. This study reviews the experience at a single cancer center with chest wall reconstruction over a decade. A retrospective review was undertaken for each patient who underwent chest wall reconstruction from 1992 to 2002. Patient demographics and variables, including pathologic diagnosis, extent of resection, size of defect, method of reconstruction, and outcome were evaluated. There was a total of 113 patients, 88 females and 25 males. The average age was 58 years (range, 19-88 years). The most common diagnoses were breast cancer and sarcoma. The average area of the chest wall defect after resection was 266 cm. One hundred fifty-seven musculocutaneous or muscle flaps were performed for reconstruction of the chest wall. Eleven percent of patients underwent reconstruction with autologous free tissue transfer. One hundred six patients underwent a single operation. Seven patients required a second operation for salvage of a complication. In 19 cases (15%), more than 1 flap was used simultaneously to complete the reconstruction. Eighty-four percent of the patients achieved stable chest wall reconstruction with no complications. Seven patients (4%) had partial (>10%) flap loss. The most common remaining postoperative complications were delayed wound healing (3% of patients), infection (2.5%), and hematoma (2.5%). Immediate chest wall reconstruction is safe, reliable, and can most often be accomplished with 1 operation. A variety of flaps, both single and in combination, could be used to achieve definitive coverage of the chest wall after extirpative surgery. The reconstructive choice is dependent on factors such as size of the defect, location on the chest wall, arc of rotation of the flap, and availability of recipient vessels. Based on this single institutional experience over a decade, an algorithm to chest wall reconstruction is provided.",Chang RR; Mehrara BJ; Hu QY; Disa JJ; Cordeiro PG,,2004,Annals of plastic surgery,Journal Article,,

To obtain the Haller Index (HI) and Asymmetry Index (AI) from chest fast MRI protecting patients from radiation exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the data of 42 consecutive patients with severe PE who underwent minimally invasive repair between March 2007 and March 2010. All 42 patients received chest fast MRI, but only the first 5 in view of the results, were studied also with chest ultrafast CT scan. In both examinations, data at the deepest point of the depression were collected. RESULTS: Severity indices of the deformity using HI and AI, collected from CT scan and fast MRI in the first 5 patients, were comparable. In the remaining 37 fast chest MRI offered good images of the chest wall deformities with no radiation exposure, detailing anatomical information such as displacement and rotation of the heart or great vessels anomalies. CONCLUSION: This study suggests the use of chest MRI in pre operative workup for patients with PE to obtain severity indices (Haller Index and Asymmetry Index avoiding radiation exposure to paediatric patients.",Lo Piccolo R; Bongini U; Basile M; Savelli S; Morelli C; Cerra C; Spinelli C; Messineo A,,2012,Journal of pediatric surgery,Clinical Trial; Comparative Study; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,11249886,Results of the study to determine rotablator and transluminal angioplasty strategy (STRATAS).,"Rotational atherectomy is used to debulk calcified or complex coronary stenoses. Whether aggressive burr sizing with minimal balloon dilation (<1 atm) to limit deep wall arterial injury improves results is unknown. Patients being considered for elective rotational atherectomy were randomized to either an ""aggressive"" strategy (n = 249) (maximum burr/artery >0.70 alone, or with adjunctive balloon inflation < or = 1 atm), or a ""routine"" strategy (n = 248) (maximum burr/artery < or =0.70 and routine balloon inflation > or =4 atm). Patient age was 62 +/- 11 years. Fifty-nine percent routine and 60% aggressive strategy patients had class III to IV angina. Fifteen percent routine and 16% aggressive strategy patients had a restenotic lesion treated; lesion length was 13.6 versus 13.7 mm. Reference vessel diameter was 2.64 mm. Maximum burr size (1.8 vs 2.1 mm), burr/artery ratio (0.71 vs 0.82), and number of burrs used (1.9 vs 2.7) were greater for the aggressive strategy, p <0.0001. Final minimum lumen diameter and residual stenosis were 1.97 mm and 26% for the routine strategy versus 1.95 mm and 27% for the aggressive strategy. Clinical success was 93.5% for the routine strategy and 93.9% for the aggressive strategy. Creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) was >5 times normal in 7% of the routine versus 11% of the aggressive group. CK-MB elevation was associated with a decrease in rpm of >5,000 from baseline for a cumulative time >5 seconds, p = 0.002. At 6 months, 22% of the routine patients versus 31% of the aggressive strategy patients had target lesion revascularization. Angiographic follow-up (77%) showed minimum lumen diameter to be 1.26 mm in the routine group versus 1.16 mm in the aggressive group, and the loss index 0.54 versus 0.62. Dichotomous restenosis was 52% for the routine strategy versus 58% for the aggressive strategy. Multivariable analysis indicated that left anterior descending location (odds ratio 1.67, p = 0.02) and operator-reported excessive speed decrease >5,000 rpm (odds ratio 1.74, p = 0.01) were significantly associated with restenosis. Thus, the aggressive rotational atherectomy strategy offers no advantage over more routine burr sizing plus routine angioplasty. Operator technique reflected by an rpm decrease of >5,000 from baseline is associated with CK-MB elevation and restenosis.",Whitlow PL; Bass TA; Kipperman RM; Sharaf BL; Ho KK; Cutlip DE; Zhang Y; Kuntz RE; Williams DO; Lasorda DM; Moses JW; Cowley MJ; Eccleston DS; Horrigan MC; Bersin RM; Ramee SR; Feldman T,,2001,The American journal of cardiology,Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Randomized Controlled Trial,,

However, long-term angiographic and clinical outcomes after beta radiation therapy have not been sufficiently evaluated. METHODS: We evaluated the long-term angiographic and clinical outcomes of 50 consecutive patients who had received beta-radiation therapy with a 188Re-MAG3-filled balloon after rotational atherectomy for diffuse in-stent restenosis (lesion length>10 mm) in native coronary arteries. The radiation dose was 15 Gy at a depth of 1.0 mm into the vessel wall. RESULTS: The mean lesion length was 25.6+/-12.7 mm. Radiation was delivered successfully to all patients without any procedural or in-hospital complications. At the 6-month angiogram, the restenosis rates was 10% (5/50). There were no major adverse cardiac events (MACE), such as death, myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization (TLR) by 6-month follow-up. Long-term clinical follow-up data were obtained in all patients during 30.1+/-4.5 months. No myocardial infarction and one noncardiac death occurred during follow-up. Two-year follow-up angiogram was performed in 26 (58%) of 45 patients who showed a patent radiation segment at the 6-month angiogram. Significant narrowing of diameter stenosis of more than 50% occurred in 6 (23%) of 26 patients between 6 and 24 months after beta-radiation. Late TLR was performed in 6 patients. The rate of 30-month death-free survival and MACE-free survival were 98.0+/-2.0% and 86.9+/-5.0%.

rotating_wall,28470391,Continuously Grooved Stent Struts for Enhanced Endothelial Cell Seeding.,"PURPOSE: Implantation of pre-endothelialized stents could enhance cellular recovery of a damaged vessel wall provided attached cells remain viable, functional and are present in sufficient numbers after deployment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of grooved stainless steel (SS) stents as a primary endothelial cell (EC) carrier with potentially enhanced EC protection upon stent deployment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Attachment and behavior of enzymatically harvested human adult venous ECs seeded onto gelatin-coated vascular stents were evaluated in an in vitro setting. Smooth and grooved SS stents and smooth nitinol stents were studied. RESULTS: All cells expressed EC markers vWF and CD31. Using rotational seeding for a period of 16-24 h, ECs attached firmly to the stents with sufficient coverage to form a confluent EC monolayer. The grooved SS wire design was found to enable attachment of three times the number of cells compared to smooth wires. This also resulted in an increased number of cells remaining on the stent after deployment and after pulsatile flow of 180 ml/min for 24 h, which did not result in additional EC detachment. CONCLUSIONS: The grooved stent provides a potential percutaneous means to deliver sufficient numbers of viable and functional cells to a vessel segment during vascular intervention. The grooves were found to offer a favorable surface for EC attachment and protection during stent deployment in an in vitro setting.",Ter Meer M; Daamen WF; Hoogeveen YL; van Son GJF; Schaffer JE; van der Vliet JA; Kool LJS; van den Heuvel LP,316L stainless steel; Cell adhesion; Endothelialization; Endovascular stent; In vitro; Nitinol,2017,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,Comparative Study; Journal Article,,

In this study we demonstrate how these limitations of IV-OCT can be addressed by using an imaging system that we called ""Heartbeat OCT"", combining a fast Fourier Domain Mode Locked laser, fast pullback, and a micromotor actuated catheter, designed to examine a coronary vessel in less than one cardiac cycle. We acquired in vivo data sets of two coronary arteries in a porcine heart with both Heartbeat OCT, working at 2.88 MHz A-line rate, 4000 frames/s and 100 mm/s pullback speed, and with a commercial system. The in vivo results show that Heartbeat OCT provides faithfully rendered, motion-artifact free, fully sampled vessel wall architecture, unlike the conventional IV-OCT data.

rotating_wall,12598029,Multislice helical CT of the pancreas and spleen.,"Multislice helical CT (MSCT) with its multidetector technology and faster rotation times, has led to new dimensions in spatial and temporal resolution in CT imaging. In contrast to single-slice CT, smaller slice collimations can be applied that lead to almost isotropic voxels and allow high quality multiplanar and 3-D image reconstructions. The high speed of multislice CT can be used to reduce the time needed to cover a given volume, to increase the spatial resolution along the z-axis by applying thinner slice collimations, and to cover longer anatomic volumes. The speed of MSCT allows organ imaging in clearly defined perfusion phases, e.g. the arterial, parenchymal, and portal venous perfusion phases. Contrast agents with higher iodine concentrations (400 mg iodine per ml compared with 300 mg iodine per ml) lead to higher contrast enhancement of the pancreas (arterial+portal venous phases), the kidneys (arterial+portal venous phases), the spleen (arterial phase), the wall of the small intestine (arterial+portal venous phases), the larger and smaller arteries (arterial phase), and the portal vein (portal venous phase).

Therefore, the establishment of research models that closely resemble original tumor characteristics is crucial to further understanding the mechanisms of malignant tumor development, developing safer and more effective drugs, and formulating personalized treatment plans. Recently, organoids have been widely used in tumor research owing to their advantages including preserving the structure, heterogeneity, and cellular functions of the original tumor, together with the ease of manipulation. This review describes the history and characteristics of tumor organoids and the synergistic combination of three-dimensional (3D) culture approaches for tumor organoids with emerging technologies, including tissue-engineered cell scaffolds, microfluidic devices, 3D bioprinting, rotating wall vessels, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9). Additionally, the progress in research and the applications in basic and clinical research of tumor organoid models are summarized.

rotating_wall,18431787,Osteoblast response to continuous phase macroporous scaffolds under static and dynamic culture conditions.,"Average scaffold pore sizes in the order of several hundred microns are generally required for efficient bone tissue ingrowth in vivo, whereas the culture of large bone engineering constructs in vitro can require bioreactor cultures to decrease diffusional constraints on the cells. In this study, we prepared poly(epsilon-caprolactone/D,L-lactide)-based scaffolds with continuous phase macroporosity using a novel CaCl(2) . 6H(2)O porogen agent. Osteogenic differentiation and scaffold colonization in rat bone marrow stromal cell cultures were compared in such polymer scaffolds, and in composites with 30 wt % bioactive glass filler. The effect of a rotating wall bioreactor culture on the cell response was also evaluated. Bioactive filler enhanced proliferation, early osteogenic differentiation, and mineralization of the cultured cells under static conditions. Dynamic cultures, in turn, resulted in decreased cell numbers and inhibition of the differentiation process irrespective of the scaffold type. This effect was ascribed to the harsh mechanical stresses caused by constant collisions of the scaffolds in the bioreactor vessels. However, cells were able to penetrate into the scaffold interior only under dynamic culture conditions. Thus, interconnected macroporosity is an essential, but not sufficient, condition to allow for full colonization of millimeter scale tissue engineering scaffolds in vitro.",Meretoja VV; Malin M; Seppälä JV; Närhi TO,,2009,Journal of biomedical materials research.

rotating_wall,11409685,Simulated microgravity impairs respiratory burst activity in human promyelocytic cells.,"The concept of microgravity (free-fall) influencing cellular functions in nonadherent cells has not been a part of mainstream scientific thought. Utilizing rotating wall vessels (RWVs) to generate simulated microgravity conditions, we found that respiratory burst activity was significantly altered in nonadherent promyelocytic (HL-60) cells. Specifically, HL-60 cells in simulated microgravity for 6, 19, 42, 47, and 49 d had 3.8-fold fewer cells that were able to participate in respiratory burst activity than cells from 1 x g cultures (P = 0.0011, N = 5). The quantity of respiratory burst products from the cells in simulated microgravity was also significantly reduced. The fold increase over controls in mean fluorescence intensities for oxidative products from cells in microgravity was 1.1+/-0.1 versus 1.8+/-0.3 for cells at 1 x g (P = 0.013, N = 4). Furthermore, the kinetic response for phorbol ester-stimulated burst activity was affected by simulated microgravity. These results demonstrate that simulated microgravity alters an innate cellular function (burst activity). If respiratory burst activity is impaired by true microgravity, then recovery from infections during spaceflight could be delayed. Finally, RWVs provide an excellent model for investigating the mechanisms associated with microgravity-induced changes in nonadherent cells.",Hughes JH; Long JP,,2001,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

This study describes a novel PCV3-associated clinical disease in piglets from Brazil. Since September 2020, we received 48 piglets with large caudally rotated ears, weakness, and dyspnea. Most piglets were from gilts and died 1-5 days after birth. Two piglets that presented similar clinical signs and survived until 35-60 days had a marked decrease in growth rate. At post-mortem examination, the lungs did not collapse due to marked interlobular edema. Microscopically, the main feature was multisystemic vasculitis characterized by lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrating and disrupting the wall of vessels, lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, and encephalitis. Viral replication was confirmed in these lesions through in situ hybridization (ISH-RNA). Seventeen cases were positive for PCV3 in PCR analysis, and all samples tested negative for porcine circovirus (PCV1, and PCV2); porcine parvovirus (PPV1, 2, 5, and 6); atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV); porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRSV); and ovine herpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2).

The B. subtilis strain exposed to the SMG (labeled BSS) showed an enhanced growth ability, increased biofilm formation ability, increased sensitivity to ampicillin sulbactam and cefotaxime, and some metabolic alterations compared with the B. subtilis strain under NG conditions (labeled BSN) and the original strain of B. subtilis (labeled BSO). The differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) associated with an increased growth rate, such as DNA strand exchange activity, oxidoreductase activity, proton-transporting ATP synthase complex, and biosynthetic process, were significantly upregulated in BSS. The enhanced biofilm formation ability may be related with the DEPs of spore germination and protein processing in BSS, and differentially expressed genes involved in protein localization and peptide secretion were also significantly enriched. The results revealed that SMG may increase the level of related functional proteins by upregulating or downregulating affiliated genes to change physiological characteristics and modulate growth ability, biofilm formation ability (epsB, epsC, epsN), antibiotic sensitivity (penP) and metabolism.

However, iprA is uncharacterized in the literature. In this report, we present the first targeted characterization of this gene, which revealed that iprA is highly conserved across Enterobacteriaceae We found that S Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae ΔiprA mutant strains display a multi-log-fold increase in oxidative stress resistance that is complemented using a plasmid-borne wild-type (WT) copy of the S Typhimurium iprA gene. This observation was also associated with increased catalase activity, increased S Typhimurium survival in macrophages, and partial dependence on the katE gene and full dependence on the rpoS gene. Our results indicate that IprA protein activity is sensitive to deletion of the N- and C-terminal 10 amino acids, while a region that includes amino acids 56 to 80 is dispensable for activity. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed several genes altered in expression in the S Typhimurium ΔiprA mutant strain compared to the WT, including those involved in fimbria formation, spvABCD-mediated virulence, ethanolamine utilization, the phosphotransferase system (PTS) transport, and flagellin phase switching from FlgB to FliC (likely a stochastic event) and several genes of hypothetical or putative function. IMPORTANCE: Overall, this work reveals that the conserved iprA gene measurably influences bacterial biology and highlights the pool of currently uncharacterized genes that are conserved across bacterial genomes.

In order to investigate the role of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining hepatocyte differentiated functions ex vivo, primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured either as monolayers on tissue culture dishes (TCD) or as 3D aggregates in rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. Global gene expression analyses revealed that genes upregulated in 3D culture were distinct from those upregulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Instead, they represented a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific functional genes with significant over-representation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (Hnf4a) binding sites in their promoters. Expression of Hnf4a and many of its downstream target genes were significantly increased in RWV cultures as compared to TCD. Conversely, there was concomitant suppression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes in RWV cultures that were induced in TCDs. These findings illustrate the importance of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining fundamental molecular pathways of hepatocyte function and serve as a basis for rational design of biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte functions ex vivo for biomedical applications.",Chang TT; Hughes-Fulford M,Bioreactor; Gene expression; Hepatocyte; Microarray; Spheroid; Three-dimensional cell culture,2014,Biomaterials,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",UH3-AG037628/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States; P30 DK026743/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States; UH3 AG037628/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States; P30-DK026743/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States; K08-DK093708/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States; K08 DK093708/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States,

It is known that the activation of transcription factors and molecular signaling pathways influence various physiological outcomes associated with stress and adaptive responses. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is one of the most prevailing oxidation-sensitive transcription factors. It is hypothesized that simulated microgravity would activate NF-kappaB and its downstream transcriptional networks, thus suggesting a role for NF-kappaB in microgravity induced muscle atrophy. To investigate the activation of NF-kappaB in a rat cardiac cell line (H9c2) under micro-g, rotating wall vessel bioreactors were used to simulate micro-g conditions. Western blotting revealed that mean nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p65 subunit was 69% for micro-g and 46% for unit-g dynamic control as compared with a 30 min TNF-alpha positive control (p<0.05, n=3). The results from western blots were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which showed 66% for micro-g and 45% for dynamic control as compared with positive control (p<0.05, n=3).

Three-dimensional and cylindrical aggregates of allogeneic cartilage with dimensions of 10 x 5 mm (height x diameter) formed by the RWV bioreactor were transplanted into osteochondral defects of Japanese white rabbits (Group T, n = 15). For the control, some osteochondral defects were left empty (Group C, n = 18). At 4, 8, and 12 weeks postimplantation, the reparative tissues were evaluated macroscopically, histologically, and biochemically. In Group T at as early as 4 weeks, histological observation, especially via safranin-O staining, suggested that the reparative tissues resembled hyaline cartilage. And we observed no fibrous tissues between reparative tissue and adjacent normal tissues. In the deeper portion of the bony compartment, the osseous tissues were well remodeled. At 4 and 8 weeks postimplantation, the mean histological score of Group T was significantly better than that of Group C (p < 0.05). The glycosaminoglycans (GAG)/DNA ratio in both groups increased gradually from 4 to 8 weeks and then decreased from 8 to 12 weeks.

Furthermore, interactions between host tissue and developing tumors influence the susceptibility of tumors to drug treatments. Host-liver colorectal-tumor spheroids composed of primary human hepatocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and colon carcinoma HCT116 cells were created in simulated microgravity rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. The cells were seeded on hyaluronic acid-based microcarriers, loaded with liver-specific growth factors and ECM components. Only in the presence of MSC, large tumor foci rapidly formed inside the spheroids and increased in size steadily over time, while not greatly impacting albumin secretion from hepatocytes. The presence of MSC appeared to drive self-organization and formation of a stroma-like tissue surrounding the tumor foci and hepatocytes. Exposure to a commonly used chemotherapeutic 5-FU showed a dose-dependent cytotoxicity. However, if tumor organoids were allowed to mature in the RWV, they were less sensitive to the drug treatment.

rotating_wall,15671151,Complex extracellular matrices promote tissue-specific stem cell differentiation.,"Most cells in tissues contact an extracellular matrix on at least one surface. These complex mixtures of interacting proteins provide structural support and biological signals that regulate cell differentiation and may be important for stem cell differentiation. In this study, we have grown a rhesus monkey embryonic stem cell line in the presence of various extracellular matrix components in monolayer, in a NASA-developed rotating wall vessel bioreactor in vitro, and subcutaneously in vivo. We find that individual components of the extracellular matrix, such as laminin-1 or collagen I, do not influence the growth or morphology of the cells. In contrast, a basement membrane extract, Matrigel, containing multiple extracellular matrix components, induces the cells within 4 days to form immature glandular- and tubular-like structures, many of which contain a lumen with polarized epithelium and microvilli. Such structures were seen in vitro when the cells were grown in the bioreactor and when the cells were injected into mice. These tubular- and glandular-like structures were polarized epithelia based on immunostaining for laminin and cytokeratin. The cell aggregates and tumors also contained additional mixed populations of cells, including mesenchymal cells and neuronal cells, based on immunostaining with vimentin and neuronal markers. An extract of cartilage, containing multiple cartilage matrix components, promoted chondrogenesis in vivo where alcian blue-stained cartilage nodules could be observed. Some of these nodules stained with von Kossa, indicating that they had formed calcified cartilage. We conclude that extracellular matrices can promote the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into differentiated cells and structures that are similar to the tissue from which the matrix is derived.

rotating_wall,27496422,Assessment of the Hemostatic Parameters and Platelet Function on Thromboelastometry and Impedance Aggregometry in Hemodialysis Patients Qualified for Kidney Transplantation: Preliminary Report.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease is one of the medical conditions that affect hemostasis. Patients undergoing hemodialysis present both hemorrhagic and prothrombotic tendencies. Platelet adhesion to the artificial surface of the dialyzer's membrane, blood vessel endothelial wall disruption, and quantitative and qualitative changes in clothing factors are thought to be causative agents of the above-mentioned conditions. Thromboelastometry and impedance aggregometry enable precise assessment of clot formation and platelet function abnormalities, including changes related to chronic renal failure in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy. METHODS: A prospective study with control group was designed. The study group consisted of 17 adults with diagnosed chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis. The control group consisted of 13 healthy volunteers. EXTEM and FIBTEM tests in rotational thromboelastometry and TRAPtest in impedance aggregometry analyzer were performed. RESULTS: EXTEM parameter test results were comparable between analyzed groups, whereas FIBTEM test results were significantly increased in the study group. Platelet aggregation as measured by the TRAPtests was significantly decreased in patients undergoing hemodialysis. CONCLUSIONS: In end-stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis, whole-blood clot formation is not disturbed, even though platelet dysfunction occurs. Increased fibrin clot formation reflected by FIBTEM results may compensate the observed platelet disorders. The compilation of ROTEM and Multiplate may support appropriate hemostatic control and decision-making during kidney transplantation.",Pluta J; Nicińska B; Grzeszczyk M; Kołacz M; Jureczko L; Kwiatkowski A; Durlik M; Trzebicki J,,2016,Transplantation proceedings,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,17520667,The effect of simulated microgravity on osteoblasts is independent of the induction of apoptosis.,"Bone loss during spaceflight has been attributed, in part, to a reduction in osteoblast number, altered gene expression, and an increase in cell death. To test the hypothesis that microgravity induces osteoblast apoptosis and suppresses the mature phenotype, we created a novel system to simulate spaceflight microgravity combining control and experimental cells within the same in vitro environment. Cells were encapsulated into two types of alginate carriers: non-rotationally stabilized (simulated microgravity) and rotationally stabilized (normal gravity). Using these specialized carriers, we were able to culture MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells for 1-14 days in simulated microgravity and normal gravity in the same rotating wall vessel (RWV). The viability of cells was not affected by simulated microgravity, nor was the reductive reserve. To determine if simulated microgravity sensitized the osteoblasts to apoptogens, cells were challenged with staurosporine or sodium nitroprusside and the cell death was measured. Simulated microgravity did not alter the sensitivity of C3H10T-1/2 stem cells, MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells, or MLO-A5 osteocyte-like cells to the action of these agents. RT-PCR analysis indicated that MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts maintained expression of RUNX2, osteocalcin, and collagen type I, but alkaline phosphatase expression was decreased in cells subjected to simulated microgravity for 5 days. We conclude that osteoblast apoptosis is not induced by vector-averaged gravity, thus suggesting that microgravity does not directly induce osteoblast death.",Bucaro MA; Zahm AM; Risbud MV; Ayyaswamy PS; Mukundakrishnan K; Steinbeck MJ; Shapiro IM; Adams CS,,2007,Journal of cellular biochemistry,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",DE-05748/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States; DE-10875/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States; DE-13319/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,17086762,Melanoma growth and tumorigenicity in models of microgravity.,"INTRODUCTION: Spaceflight involves numerous biological stressors that could affect long-term cancer incidence and tumor behavior. Ground-based models of microgravity can be used to investigate in vitro and in vivo tumor growth as a preparation for later work in space. The incidence of tumor growth and carcinogenesis in microgravity is as yet unknown. Hence, we investigated the effects of modeled microgravity on tumor growth and tumorigenicity using ground-based in vitro and in vivo models. METHODS: Murine B16-F10 melanoma cells were cultured in a tissue culture flask (FL) and in a rotating-wall vessel bioreactor (BIO) designed by NASA to simulate some aspects of microgravity. We then measured cell growth, melanin production, and apoptosis. After 48 h of cultures in FL and BIO, cells were inoculated subcutaneously in C57BL/6 mice, syngeneic hosts for B16-F10 tumor cells. Tumor sizes were then measured every other day. RESULTS: BIO cultures had 50% decreases in growth when compared with FL cultures while demonstrating an inversely proportional increase in doubling time. Melanin production (a marker of differentiation) increased at 24 and 48 h in BIO. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that there was an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in the BIO when compared with that in the FL. When BIO-cultured melanoma cells were inoculated subcutaneously in mice, there was a significant increase in tumorigenicity as compared with FL-cultured cells. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that simulated microgravity may have altered the tumor cell characteristics and enhanced the invasive property. It is possible that the microgravity analogue culture environment may have selected highly tumorigenic cells for survival despite the decreased overall growth in the microgravity analogue.",Taga M; Yamauchi K; Odle J; Furian L; Sundaresan A; Ramesh GT; Pellis NR; Andrassy RJ; Kulkarni AD,,2006,"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine","Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae homozygous diploid deletion pool (HDDP), and the BY4743 parental strain were grown for 18 h in a rotating wall vessel (RWV), a suspension culture device optimized to minimize the delivered shear. In addition to the reduced shear conditions, the RWVs were also placed in a static position or in a shaker in order to change the amount of shear stress on the cells. Using simple linear regression, it was found that there were 140 differentially expressed genes for which >70% of the variation can be explained by shear stress alone. A significant number of these genes are involved in catalytic activity. In the HDDP, shear stress was associated with significant survival changes in 15 deletion strains (R(2>) > 0.7) Interestingly, both analyses uncovered changes in the ribosomal protein machinery. Comparing the changes in gene expression and strain survival under the different shear conditions allows for the insights into the molecular mechanisms behind the cells response to shear stress. This in turn can provide information for the optimization of suspension culture.",Johanson K; Allen PL; Gonzalez-Villalobos RA; Baker CB; D'Elia R; Hammond TG,,2006,Biotechnology and bioengineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,

In this study, we aimed to develop a surgical technique to implant hepatic organoids into the liver and assess their engraftment. METHODS: Donor hepatocytes were isolated from ROSA26 C57BL/6 mice, so that engrafted cells, when implanted into wild-type mice, could be easily identified by X-gal staining. Hepatic organoids were generated by three-dimensional culture in rotating wall vessel bioreactors. We qualitatively and quantitatively compared organoid engraftment to that of single-cell hepatocyte transplants. In addition, we determined the effect of adding stellate cells to hepatocytes to form co-aggregated organoids and the effect of partial hepatectomy of the host liver on organoid engraftment. RESULTS: Direct orthotopic implantation of hepatic organoids within a hepatotomy site resulted in local engraftment of exogenous hepatocytes with limited durability. Hepatocyte-stellate cell organoids produced more extracellular matrix but did not significantly improve engraftment compared with hepatocyte-alone organoids. Partial hepatectomy of the host liver led to significantly decreased engraftment of organoids. Survival of organoids was limited by the presence of apoptotic hepatocytes within organoids as early as 1 h after implantation. Organoids eventually became necrotic and elicited a chronic inflammatory giant cell reaction similar to a foreign body response. CONCLUSIONS: With additional organoid and host factor optimization, direct orthotopic implantation of hepatic organoids may be an approach to introduce large numbers of exogenous hepatocytes into recipient livers.",Zhou VX; Lolas M; Chang TT,Liver organoids; Three-dimensional culture; Tissue engineering; Transplantation,2017,The Journal of surgical research,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",K08 DK093708/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States; P30 DK026743/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,19847365,[Effects of parabolic flight on redox status in SH-SY5Y cells].,"Space flight is known to produce a number of neurological disturbances. The etiology is unknown, but it may involve increased oxidative stress. A line of experimental evidence indicates that space flight may disrupt antioxidant defense system and result in increased oxidative stress. In vitro studies found that abundant of NO was produced in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and protein nitration was increased in PC12 cells within a simulated microgravity rotating wall bioreactor high aspect ratio vessel system or clinostat system. In the present study, we observed the change of redox status in SH-SY5Y cells after parabolic flight, and studied the effects of key redox molecule, thioredoxin (TRX), during the altered gravity. SH-SY5Y cells were divided into four groups: control cells, control cells transfected with TRX, flight cells and flight cells transfected with TRX. The expression levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TRX and thioredoxin reductase (TRXR) were observed by immunocytochemical method. It was shown that after parabolic flight, the staining of 3-NT and TRX were enhanced, while the expression level of TRXR was down-regulated compared with control. As for flight cells transfected with TRX, the staining of 3-NT and iNOS were weakened compared with flight cells. These results obtained suggest that altered gravity may increase protein nitration, down-regulate TRXR and elicit oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells, while TRX transfection could partly protect cells against oxidative stress induced by parabolic flight.",Bi L; Qu LN; Huang ZM; Wang CY; Li Q; Tan YJ; Li YH,,2009,Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica],"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,19415677,Simulated microgravity decreases DNA repair capacity and induces DNA damage in human lymphocytes.,"The effect of simulated microgravity on DNA damage and apoptosis is still controversial. The objective of this study was to test whether simulated microgravity conditions affect the expression of genes for DNA repair and apoptosis. To achieve this objective, human lymphocyte cells were grown in a NASA-developed rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor that simulates microgravity. The same cell line was grown in parallel under normal gravitational conditions in culture flasks. The effect of microgravity on the expression of genes was measured by quantitative real-time PCR while DNA damage was examined by comet assay. The result of this study revealed that exposure to simulated microgravity condition decreases the expression of DNA repair genes. Mismatch repair (MMR) class of DNA repair pathway were more susceptible to microgravity condition-induced gene expression changes than base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) class of DNA repair genes. Downregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation (CyclinD1 and PCNA) and apoptosis (Bax) was also observed. Microgravity-induced changes in the expression of some of these genes were further verified at the protein level by Western blot analysis. The findings of this study suggest that microgravity may induce alterations in the expression of these DNA repair genes resulting in accumulation of DNA damage. Reduced expression of cell-cycle genes suggests that microgravity may cause a reduction in cell growth. Downregulation of pro-apoptotic genes further suggests that extended exposure to microgravity may result in a reduction in the cells' ability to undergo apoptosis.

rotating_wall,17142365,Novel quantitative biosystem for modeling physiological fluid shear stress on cells.,"The response of microbes to changes in the mechanical force of fluid shear has important implications for pathogens, which experience wide fluctuations in fluid shear in vivo during infection. However, the majority of studies have not cultured microbes under physiological fluid shear conditions within a range commonly encountered by microbes during host-pathogen interactions. Here we describe a convenient batch culture biosystem in which (i) the levels of fluid shear force can be varied within physiologically relevant ranges and quantified via mathematical models and (ii) large numbers of cells can be planktonically grown and harvested to examine the effect of fluid shear levels on microbial genomic and phenotypic responses. A quantitative model based on numerical simulations and in situ imaging analysis was developed to calculate the fluid shear imparted by spherical beads of different sizes on bacterial cell cultures grown in a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. To demonstrate the application of this model, we subjected cultures of the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to three physiologically-relevant fluid shear ranges during growth in the RVW and demonstrated a progressive relationship between the applied fluid shear and the bacterial genetic and phenotypic responses. By applying this model to different cell types, including other bacterial pathogens, entire classes of genes and proteins involved in cellular interactions may be discovered that have not previously been identified during growth under conventional culture conditions, leading to new targets for vaccine and therapeutic development.",Nauman EA; Ott CM; Sander E; Tucker DL; Pierson D; Wilson JW; Nickerson CA,,2007,Applied and environmental microbiology,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,

In this investigation we explored whether the observed functional changes in lymphocytes in MAS are associated with changes in gene expression. NASA-developed Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor was utilized as a MAS. Activated T lymphocytes were obtained by adding 100 ng/ml of anti-CD3 and 100 U/ml of IL-2 in RPMI medium to blood donor mononuclear cells for 4 days. After that the cells were washed and additionally cultured for up to 2 weeks with media (RPMI, 10% FBS and 100 U/ml IL-2) replacement every 3-4 days. Flow cytometry analysis had proven that activated T lymphocytes were the only cells remaining in culture by that time. They were split into two portions, cultured for additional 24 h in either static or simulated microgravity conditions, and used for RNA extraction. The gene expression was assessed by Affymetrix GeneChip Human U133A array allowing screening for expression of 18,400 genes. About 4-8% of tested genes responded to MG by more than a 1.5-fold change in expression; however, reproducible changes were observed only in 89 genes. Ten of these genes were upregulated and 79 were downregulated. These genes were categorized by associated pathways and viewed graphically through histogram analysis. Separate histograms of each pathway were then constructed representing individual gene expression fold changes. Possible functional consequences of the identified reproducible gene expression changes are discussed.",Ward NE; Pellis NR; Risin SA; Risin D,,2006,Journal of cellular biochemistry,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Mechanisms involved in this process are not well understood but involve the suppression of osteoblast function. To elucidate the influence of mechanical unloading on osteoblasts, a rotating wall vessel (RWV) was employed as a ground based model of simulated microgravity. Mouse MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were grown on microcarrier beads for 14 days and then placed in the RWV for 24 h. Consistent with decreased bone formation during actual spaceflight conditions, alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin expression were decreased by 80 and 50%, respectively. In addition, runx2 expression and AP-1 transactivation, key regulators of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, were reduced by more than 60%. This finding suggests that simulated microgravity could promote dedifferentiation and/or transdifferentiation to alternative cell types; however, markers of adipocyte, chondrocyte, and myocyte lineages were not induced by RWV exposure. Taken together, our results indicate that simulated microgravity may suppress osteoblast differentiation through decreased runx2 and AP-1 activities.",Ontiveros C; McCabe LR,,2003,Journal of cellular biochemistry,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,10562917,Intravascular ultrasound classification of atherosclerotic lesions according to American Heart Association recommendation.,"BACKGROUND: Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) offers a new modality by which to image the vessel wall in high resolution. The aim of the study was to classify atherosclerotic lesions using IVUS according to American Heart Association (AHA) recommendation. METHODS: IVUS was performed using a 20 or 30 MHz mechanically rotated catheter in 190 patients (aged from 35 to 75 years, mean 59 +/- 9 years) who presented with suspicion of coronary artery disease based on clinical examination. RESULTS: Of the 190 patients, 49 (26%) (group A) were found to have normal or nearly normal coronary arteries, whereas the other 141 (74%) (group B) had significant angiographic stenosis (> 50% luminal narrowing). IVUS image interpretation was based on the recommendation of the Committee on Vascular Lesions of the Council on Atherosclerosis (AHA). In group A, a total of 822 segments were evaluated with IVUS; 444 (54%) were found to have plaque formation. Among these 444 segments, type II lesions were found in 145 (33%), type III lesions in 110 segments (25%), type IV and Va lesions in 169 segments (38%), and type Vb in 18 segments (4%). The severity of plaque area stenosis increased from type II to IV. In group B, only the most stenotic segments (n = 141) on angiography were selected for analysis. No significant differences were found among different lesion types with respect to the severity of plaque area stenosis. Type Vb and Vc lesions presented mainly, but not exclusively, as stable angina, whereas type VI lesions presented mainly as unstable angina. Some patients (12%) with stable angina had complicated lesions (type VIa-VIc). CONCLUSIONS: It is now possible to use intravascular ultrasound to classify atherosclerotic lesions according to the AHA recommendations that were based on histological examination. Standardized reports of IVUS can now be based on these recommendations. Even in angiographically normal coronary arteries, advanced atherosclerotic lesions are found, explaining the potential risk of acute coronary syndromes in this group of patients. In patients with angiographically severe coronary disease, clinical symptoms correlate mainly with plaque characteristics, rather than with the severity of stenosis.",Erbel R; Ge J; Görge G; Baumgart D; Haude M; Jeremias A; von Birgelen C; Jollet N; Schwedtmann J,,1999,Coronary artery disease,Journal Article,,

The prototype transducer was found to generate peak radial displacements of over [Formula: see text] in soft gelatin phantoms, and simulations demonstrate the ability of the array design to obtain ARFI images and distinguish soft plaque targets from surrounding, stiffer vessel wall tissue.

This review presents an overview of the general principles, technique and emerging applications and artifacts of coronary multislice CT angiography. The diagnostic performance of this new technology allows it to be used to evaluate the presence of coronary plaques and stenosis, coronary bypass graft patency, and the origin and course of congenital coronary anomalies. As it visualizes coronary artery wall in addition to lumen and provides volumetric data of heart and great vessels, it readily demonstrates plaque remodeling, ostial lesions and other cardiac and extracardiac abnormalities. The high negative predictive value of coronary CT angiography makes it a valuable tool in the evaluation of patients with low or intermediate pretest probability for coronary artery disease. However, improvements in spatial and temporal resolution are still needed in the imaging of small coronary stents, in the detection and characterization of noncalcified plaques, and to overcome image degradation by arrhythmias, higher heart rates, and calcium-related artifacts.",Karabulut N,,2008,Anadolu kardiyoloji dergisi : AKD = the Anatolian journal of cardiology,Journal Article; Review,,

The purpose of this multicenter study was to evaluate whether preimplantation device simulation with the Sim&Size software results in selection of different device dimensions than manual sizing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a multicenter cohort of 74 patients undergoing aneurysm treatment with the Pipeline Embolization Device, we compared apparent optimal device dimensions determined by neurointerventionalists with considerable Pipeline Embolization Device experience based on manual 2D measurements taken from rotational angiography with computed optimal dimensions determined by Sim&Size experts blinded to the neurointerventionalists' decision. Agreement between manually determined and computed optimal dimensions was evaluated with the Cohen κ. The significance of the difference was analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: The agreement index between manual selection and computed optimal dimensions was low (κ for diameter = 0.219; κ for length = 0.149, P < .01). Computed optimal device lengths were significantly shorter (median, 14 versus 16 mm, T = 402, r = -0.28, P < .01). No significant difference was observed for device diameters. CONCLUSIONS: Low agreement between manually determined and computed optimal device dimensions is not proof, per se, that virtual simulation performs better than manual selection. Nevertheless, it ultimately reflects the potential for optimization of the device-sizing process, and use of the Sim&Size software reduces, in particular, device length.

It is not known, however, which of these technique, when followed by beta-radiation, is more effective. Therefore, we performed a prospective randomized study comparing RA and CBA before beta-radiation therapy for diffuse ISR. METHODS: Patients with diffuse ISR were randomly assigned to receive RA (group 1, n = 58) or CBA (group 2, n = 55) before beta-radiation therapy with a rhenium 188-mercaptoacetyltriglycine-filled balloon, with the radiation dose being 18 Gy at a depth of 1.0 mm into the vessel wall. The primary end point was angiographic restenosis at 6 months, and the secondary end point was major adverse cardiac events (myocardial infarction, death, target lesion revascularization) at 9 months. RESULTS: The 2 groups were similar in baseline characteristics. Mean lesion length was 21.0 +/- 11.2 mm in group 1 and 20.8 +/- 10.2 mm in group 2 (P = .77). Radiation was delivered successfully to all patients. We obtained 6-month angiographic follow-up in 90 patients (80%). The rates of angiographic restenosis were 14.9% (7 of 47) in group 1 and 14.0% (6 of 43) in group 2 (P = .89). No patient experienced myocardial infarction or death during the 9-month follow-up period. Rates of target lesion revascularization or major adverse cardiac events were 3.4% in group 1 and 3.6% in group 2 (P = .94) during the 9-month follow-up.

METHODS: VX2 tumor pieces were implanted into colonic wall in 9 New Zealand white rabbits and rectal wall in 2 New Zealand white rabbits. Four weeks after inoculation, Ultravist(370 mg/ml) was injected through ear marginal vein with high pressure injector for stage 3 scanning of chest, abdomen and pelvis, and enhanced CT (collimation 0.5 mm mm × 320, pitch factor 0.828, bulb rotation speed 0.5 s/cycle, 120 kV, automatic ma, range 80 to 100 mAs) was performed to determine the presence of CRC or metastasis once a week for 4-6 weeks. Once inoculated CRC or metastases occurred or 6 weeks after implantation, the rabbits were sacrificed regardless of the presence or absence of CRC or metastasis on the CT images. One rabbit was used for gross anatomy observation. Others were placed in wood boxes with -80centi-degree for 24 hours, then samples of 3 mm thickness were cut using a motorized saw to make macropathology. Each cutting surface of the specimens was photographed in serial number. If certain or suspected lesions were found on the slices, such part was labeled and then placed in 10% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde numbered box for subsequent pathological examination. CT image postprocessing was performed referring to the gross slice specimens and all findings were compared with the pathological reports. RESULTS: Among 11 rabbits, tumor was successfully established in 8 rabbits. Pathology showed that single lung metastasis (7 to 10 mm) was found in 2 rabbits and liver metastasis (9 mm) in 1 rabbit. Number of lymph node located around the inoculated tumor was 22 and that around mesenteric vessels was 13 with diameter of 2 to 16 mm. Among these 35 lymph nodes from 8 successful rabbits, 9 nodes were positive, including 7 around inoculated tumor and 2 around mesenteric vessels. CT identified above 8 primary inoculated tumors, 2 lung metastatic lesions and 1 liver metastatic lesion, with detection rate of 100%. For the detection of lymph node in CT, 27 nodes were identified in the pericolorectal region (17 nodes) and perimesenteric vessels (10 nodes), in which 6 were positive metastasis (ring-shaped enrichment and central low density necrosis), resulting in a detection rate of 77.1%(27/35 nodes), and positive detection rate of 66.7% (6/9 nodes), respectively.

Prevailing methods for generating organoids rely on Matrigel, whose batch-to-batch variability and xenogeneic source pose challenges to mechanistic research and translation to human clinical therapy. In this report, we demonstrate that self-assembled Matrigel-free iPSC-derived organoids developed in rotating wall vessels (RWVs) exhibit greater hepatocyte-specific functions than organoids formed on Matrigel. We show that RWVs produce highly functional liver organoids in part by eliminating the need for Matrigel, which has adverse effects on hepatic lineage differentiation. RWV liver organoids sustain durable function over long-term culture and express a range of mature functional genes at levels comparable to adult human liver, while retaining some fetal features.

The exact role of coronary calcium measurements for cardiac risk stratification remains unclear to date. At contrast enhanced MDCT coronary angiography coronary arteries can be visualized with unprecedented detail. The accurate non-invasive assessment of the presence and degree of coronary artery stenosis appears within reach. With increasing accuracy MDCT enables non-invasive patency evaluation of coronary artery bypass grafts and coronary stents. The cross-sectional nature of contrast enhanced MDCT coronary angiography allows assessment of the vessel wall and may permit more accurate quantification of total atherosclerotic plaque burden than measuring calcified components alone.

(2) This model can describe ESR as a function of the velocity of adhesion of erythrocytes; (3) Determination of the ESR is best conducted at certain time intervals, i.e. in a series of periods not exceeding 5 minutes each; (4) Differential diagnosis of various diseases by means of ESR should be performed using the aforementioned timed measurement of ESR; (5) An increase in blood viscosity during trauma results from an increase in rouleaux formation and the time-course method of ESR will be useful in patients with trauma, in particular, with traumatic shock and crush syndrome. CONCLUSION: The mathematical model created in this study used the most fundamental differential equations that have ever been derived to estimate ESR. It may further our understanding of its complex mechanism.",Ismailov RM; Shevchuk NA; Khusanov H,,2005,Biomedical engineering online,Journal Article,,

Based on 3D CT animations, we propose repetitive impact between the main supplying vessels on the posterolateral femoral neck and the posterior acetabular wall in hyperextension and external rotation as a possible cause of direct vascular damage, and subsequent femoral head necrosis in three adolescent female gymnasts we are reporting on. METHODS: Outcome of hip-preserving head reduction osteotomy combined with periacetabular osteotomy was good in one and moderate in the other up to three years after surgery; based on the pronounced hip destruction, the third received initially a total hip arthroplasty. RESULTS: The described pathology is quite devastating, and extensive joint preserving surgery (which has been shown successful in Perthes' cases) was less successful in this patient cohort. CONCLUSION: Supraselective angiography may be helpful to improve pathomechanical understanding and surgical decision making.Cite this article: Bone Jt Open 2022;3(9):666-673.",Blümel S; Leunig M; Manner H; Tannast M; Stetzelberger VM; Ganz R,Femoral head necrosis; Femoral head reduction; Legg-calve-perthes disease; PAO; Perthes; Perthes-like necrosis; aetiology; angiography; dancers; femoral head; femoral neck; gymnasts; hip preserving surgery; hips; joint preserving surgery; periacetabular osteotomy; reduction osteotomy; total hip arthroplasty,2022,Bone & joint open,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,21803898,Induction of attachment-independent biofilm formation and repression of Hfq expression by low-fluid-shear culture of Staphylococcus aureus.,"The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus encounters a wide variety of fluid shear levels within the human host, and they may play a key role in dictating whether this organism adopts a commensal interaction with the host or transitions to cause disease. By using rotating-wall vessel bioreactors to create a physiologically relevant, low-fluid-shear environment, S. aureus was evaluated for cellular responses that could impact its colonization and virulence. S. aureus cells grown in a low-fluid-shear environment initiated a novel attachment-independent biofilm phenotype and were completely encased in extracellular polymeric substances. Compared to controls, low-shear-cultured cells displayed slower growth and repressed virulence characteristics, including decreased carotenoid production, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, and reduced survival in whole blood. Transcriptional whole-genome microarray profiling suggested alterations in metabolic pathways. Further genetic expression analysis revealed downregulation of the RNA chaperone Hfq, which parallels low-fluid-shear responses of certain Gram-negative organisms. This is the first study to report an Hfq association with fluid shear in a Gram-positive organism, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved response to fluid shear among structurally diverse prokaryotes. Collectively, our results suggest S. aureus responds to a low-fluid-shear environment by initiating a biofilm/colonization phenotype with diminished virulence characteristics, which could lead to insight into key factors influencing the divergence between infection and colonization during the initial host-pathogen interaction.",Castro SL; Nelman-Gonzalez M; Nickerson CA; Ott CM,,2011,Applied and environmental microbiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,

METHODS: HCT-8 cells were grown in a reduced-gravity, low-shear, rotating-wall vessel (RWV) and were infected with Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. Routine and electron microscopy (EM), immunolabeling with fluorescein-labeled Vicia villosa lectin and phycoerythrin-labeled monoclonal antibody to a 15-kD surface-membrane protein, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using probes for 18s rRNA of C. parvum and HCT-8 cells were performed. RESULTS: The RWV allowed development of columnar epithelium-like structures. Higher magnification revealed well-developed brush borders at the apical side of the tissue. Incubation with C. parvum resulted in patchy disruption of the epithelium and, at the surface of several epithelial cells, in localized infection with the organism. EM revealed irregular stunting of microvilli, foci of indistinct tight junctions, and areas of loose paracellular spaces. qPCR showed a 1.85-log (i.e., 70-fold) progression of infection from 6 h to 48 h of incubation. CONCLUSION: The HCT-8 organoid displayed morphologic changes indicative of successful and quantifiable infection with C. parvum.

To elucidate how 3D structure may affect hepatocyte cellular responses, we compared global gene expression of human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2) cells cultured as monolayers on tissue culture dishes (TCDs) or as spheroids within rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. HepG2 cells grown in RWVs form spheroids up to 100 mum in diameter within 72 h and up to 1 mm with long-term culture. The actin cytoskeleton in monolayer cells show stress fiber formation while spheroids have cortical actin organization. Global gene expression analysis demonstrates upregulation of structural genes such as extracellular matrix, cytoskeletal, and adhesion molecules in monolayers, whereas RWV spheroids show upregulation of metabolic and synthetic genes, suggesting functional differences. Indeed, liver-specific functions of cytochrome P450 activity and albumin production are higher in the spheroids. Enhanced liver functions require maintenance of 3D structure and environment, because transfer of spheroids to a TCD results in spheroid disintegration and subsequent loss of function.

Previous studies showed that microgravity compromises the human immune system and increases enteropathogen virulence. However, the effects of microgravity on epithelial barrier function are poorly understood. The aims of this study were to identify if simulated microgravity alters intestinal epithelial barrier function (permeability), and susceptibility to barrier-disrupting agents. IECs (HT-29.cl19a) were cultured on microcarrier beads in simulated microgravity using a rotating wall vessel (RWV) for 18 days prior to seeding on semipermeable supports to measure ion flux (transepithelial electrical resistance (TER)) and FITC-dextran (FD4) permeability over 14 days. RWV cells showed delayed apical junction localization of the tight junction proteins, occludin and ZO-1. The alcohol metabolite, acetaldehyde, significantly decreased TER and reduced junctional ZO-1 localization, while increasing FD4 permeability in RWV cells compared with static, motion and flask control cells. In conclusion, simulated microgravity induced an underlying and sustained susceptibility to epithelial barrier disruption upon removal from the microgravity environment.

rotating_wall,25777294,Liver-Tumor Hybrid Organoids for Modeling Tumor Growth and Drug Response In Vitro.,"Current in vitro models for tumor growth and metastasis are poor facsimiles of in vivo cancer physiology and thus, are not optimal for anti-cancer drug development. Three dimensional (3D) tissue organoid systems, which utilize human cells in a tailored microenvironment, have the potential to recapitulate in vivo conditions and address the drawbacks of current tissue culture dish 2D models. In this study, we created liver-based cell organoids in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor. The organoids were further inoculated with colon carcinoma cells in order to create liver-tumor organoids for in vitro modeling of liver metastasis. Immunofluorescent staining revealed notable phenotypic differences between tumor cells in 2D and inside the organoids. In 2D they displayed an epithelial phenotype, and only after transition to the organoids did the cells present with a mesenchymal phenotype. The cell surface marker expression results suggested that WNT pathway might be involved in the phenotypic changes observed between cells in 2D and organoid conditions, and may lead to changes in cell proliferation. Manipulating the WNT pathway with an agonist and antagonist showed significant changes in sensitivity to the anti-proliferative drug 5-fluoruracil. Collectively, the results show the potential of in vitro 3D liver-tumor organoids to serve as a model for metastasis growth and for testing the response of tumor cells to current and newly discovered drugs.",Skardal A; Devarasetty M; Rodman C; Atala A; Soker S,Drug screening; Metastasis; Organoids; Tissue engineering; Tumor models,2015,Annals of biomedical engineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",P30 CA012197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; T32 EB014836/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,9569230,Mechanical stimulation initiates intercellular Ca2+ signaling in intact tracheal epithelium maintained under normal gravity and simulated microgravity.,"We investigated mechanically induced cell-to-cell Ca2+ signaling in a preparation of rabbit tracheal epithelium close to its in vivo condition. We used confocal microscopy to analyze changes in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in intact ciliated tracheal mucosal explants loaded with the Ca2+-indicator dye, fluo-3. When a single cell in the epithelium was transiently stimulated with a microprobe, [Ca2+]i increased in the stimulated cell and then increased in surrounding cells. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the [Ca2+]i increases had a smaller amplitude and spread to fewer cells. Treatment of the cells with thapsigargin, in the presence of extracellular Ca2+, more markedly reduced the spread of elevated [Ca2+]i. These results suggest that the propagated [Ca2+]i increases are due to mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and, possibly, the influx of extracellular Ca2+. The mechanically stimulated [Ca2+]i increases were accompanied by propagated increases in ciliary beat frequency. Since microgravity has been shown to alter signal transduction, we investigated whether simulated microgravity affects the mechanically stimulated cell-to-cell Ca2+ signaling observed in tracheal epithelium. Tissues were maintained for 3-8 d in a rotating wall vessel which simulates microgravity conditions. Cells maintained in simulated microgravity exhibited mechanically induced [Ca2+]i increases not significantly different in magnitude, in speed of propagation, or in the number of cells involved, from tissue maintained at unit gravity. Our results suggest that intercellular Ca2+ signaling coordinates cellular activity, including ciliary beating, within the tracheal epithelium in vivo and that this function is not compromised in microgravity.",Felix JA; Chaban VV; Woodruff ML; Dirksen ER,,1998,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,33835498,Global transcriptomic analysis of a murine osteocytic cell line subjected to spaceflight.,"Bone loss is a major health concern for astronauts during long-term spaceflight and for patients during prolonged bed rest or paralysis. Growing evidence suggests that osteocytes, the most abundant cells in the mineralized bone matrix, play a key role in sensing mechanical forces applied to the skeleton and integrating the orchestrated response into subcellular biochemical signals to modulate bone homeostasis. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying both mechanosensation and mechanotransduction in late-osteoblast-to-osteocyte cells under microgravity (µG) have yet to be elucidated. To unravel the mechanisms by which late osteoblasts and osteocytes sense and respond to mechanical unloading, we exposed the osteocytic cell line, Ocy454, to 2, 4, or 6 days of µG on the SpaceX Dragon-6 resupply mission to the International Space Station. Our results showed that µG impairs the differentiation of osteocytes, consistent with prior osteoblast spaceflight experiments, which resulted in the downregulation of key osteocytic genes. Importantly, we demonstrate the modulation of critical glycolysis pathways in osteocytes subjected to microgravity and discovered a set of mechanical sensitive genes that are consistently regulated in multiple cell types exposed to microgravity suggesting a common, yet to be fully elucidated, genome-wide response to microgravity. Ground-based simulated microgravity experiments utilizing the NASA rotating-wall-vessel were unable to adequately replicate the changes in microgravity exposure highlighting the importance of spaceflight missions to understand the unique environmental stress that microgravity presents to diverse cell types.

rotating_wall,20236169,Response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to low shear modelled microgravity involves AlgU regulation.,"As a ubiquitous environmental organism that is occasionally part of the human flora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa could pose a health hazard for the immunocompromised astronauts during long-term missions. Therefore, insights into the behaviour of P. aeruginosa under spaceflight conditions were gained using two spaceflight-analogue culture systems: the rotating wall vessel (RWV) and the random position machine (RPM). Microarray analysis of P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown in the low shear modelled microgravity (LSMMG) environment of the RWV, compared with the normal gravity control (NG), revealed an apparent regulatory role for the alternative sigma factor AlgU (RpoE-like). Accordingly, P. aeruginosa cultured in LSMMG exhibited increased alginate production and upregulation of AlgU-controlled transcripts, including those encoding stress-related proteins. The LSMMG increased heat and oxidative stress resistance and caused a decrease in the oxygen transfer rate of the culture. This study also showed the involvement of the RNA-binding protein Hfq in the LSMMG response, consistent with its previously identified role in the Salmonella LSMMG and spaceflight response. The global transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa grown in the RPM was highly similar to that in NG. Fluid mixing was assessed in both systems and is believed to be a pivotal factor contributing to transcriptional differences between RWV- and RPM-grown P. aeruginosa. This study represents the first step towards the identification of virulence mechanisms of P. aeruginosa activated in response to spaceflight-analogue conditions, and could direct future research regarding the risk assessment and prevention of Pseudomonas infections during spaceflight and in immunocompromised patients.",Crabbé A; Pycke B; Van Houdt R; Monsieurs P; Nickerson C; Leys N; Cornelis P,,2010,Environmental microbiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,

As such, NASA-engineered three-dimensional (3-D) rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors were used in effort to promote differentiation of HCV-permissive Huh7 hepatoma cells. RESULTS: When cultured in the RWV, Huh7 cells became morphologically and transcriptionally distinct from more standard Huh7 two-dimensional (2-D) monolayers. Specifically, RWV-cultured Huh7 cells formed complex, multilayered 3-D aggregates in which Phase I and Phase II xenobiotic drug metabolism genes, as well as hepatocyte-specific transcripts (HNF4alpha, Albumin, TTR and alpha1AT), were upregulated compared to 2-D cultured Huh7 cells. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that these HCV-permissive 3-D cultured Huh7 cells were more polarized than their 2D counterparts with the expression of HCV receptors, cell adhesion and tight junction markers (CD81, scavenger receptor class B member 1, claudin-1, occludin, ZO-1, beta-Catenin and E-Cadherin) significantly increased and exhibiting apical, lateral and/or basolateral localization. CONCLUSION: These findings show that when cultured in 3-D, Huh7 cells acquire a more differentiated hepatocyte-like phenotype. Importantly, we show that these 3D cultures are highly permissive for HCV infection, thus providing an opportunity to study HCV entry and the effects of HCV infection on host cell function in a more physiologically relevant cell culture system.",Sainz B Jr; TenCate V; Uprichard SL,,2009,Virology journal,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",R21 CA133266-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; CA-133266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; AI-070827/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; DK-007788-07/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States; R01 AI070827/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; R21 CA133266/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; T32 DK007788/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States,

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate its feasibility by acute in vivo animal tests. The minimal intra-aortic pump was a cage-supported rotor-impeller, 17 mm in diameter with a total length of 30 mm. The driving magnet, mounted extracorporeally, was 55 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length. Seventeen dogs weighing from 28-34 kg were used in the study. After thoracic incision, heparin (50 U/kg) was infused. The impeller pump was inserted into the aortic chamber via a prosthetic vessel and fastened. Thin tubes were inserted into the left ventricular apex and the femoral artery to monitor the left ventricular (LV) and the aortic pressure. After closing the thoracic cavity, the extracorporeal whirling magnet, turned by an electric motor, was placed tightly against the thoracic wall parallel to the intra-aortic pump. The experiments, each lasting for about 40 min, were successful in 7 animals; the other 10 animals died of bleeding during pump implantation and were excluded from the experiment. The peak systolic pressure of the left ventricle could be considerably decreased by the pump and was reduced to as low as 28 mm Hg at a rotational speed of 9,000 rpm, showing that the simple intra-aortic impeller was effective in unloading the natural heart. The novel left ventricular assist device (LVAD) concept of an intra-aortic impeller pump, driven by an extracorporeal magnetic device, is feasible.",Li G; Zhao H; Zhu X; Ren B,,2002,Artificial organs,Journal Article,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients at risk of placenta previa were examined sequentially with 2D US and then with a targeted scan of the region of interest with adjunctive 3D US to determine whether those patients suspected of having advanced invasive placentation by conventional ultrasonographic evidence had placental invasion of the bladder. The images were coded as positive, negative or indeterminate (equivocal) for bladder invasion. Follow-up postoperative outcomes were obtained. RESULTS: Seven of the 45 patients exhibited characteristic ultrasonographic findings for placenta increta/percreta. Among these seven patients with advanced invasive placentation, a targeted scan with adjunctive 3D US correctly provided additional corroborative information to the 2D US indeterminate diagnosis in patients who were found with variable degrees of bladder wall involvement at surgery. CONCLUSION: 3D US may be a useful adjunctive tool in refining 2D ultrasonographic techniques to identify the extent and degree of placental invasion of the bladder. The advantages of 3D US are: (1) a multiplanar image display allows viewing of sections from sagittal, coronal and axial planes at the same time, thereby more accurately determining the location and extent of placental invasion; (2) the viewing planes of the spatial angioarchitecture network can be arbitrarily manipulated to better delineate the aberrant vessels protruding into the bladder; (3) 3D reconstruction images can be clearly displayed by live 3D in a rotation mode for a better illustrative effect.",Chou MM; Chen WC; Tseng JJ; Chen YF; Yeh TT; Ho ES,,2009,Taiwanese journal of obstetrics & gynecology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Homeostatic control of erythrocytes and lymphocytes is perturbed in humans exposed to microgravity (micro-g), resulting in space flight-induced anemia and immunosuppression. We sought to determine whether any of these anomalies can be explained by micro-g-induced changes in migration, proliferation, and differentiation of human BM CD34+ cells, and whether such changes can begin to explain any of the shifts in hematopoietic homeostasis observed in astronauts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BM CD34+ cells were cultured in modeled micro-g (mmicro-g) using NASA's rotating wall vessels (RWV), or in control cultures at earth gravity for 2 to 18 days. Cells were harvested at different times and CD34+ cells assessed for migration potential, cell-cycle kinetics and regulatory proteins, and maturation status. RESULTS: Culture of BM CD34+ cells in RWV for 2 to 3 days resulted in a significant reduction of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1alpha)-directed migration, which correlated with decreased expression of F-actin. Modeled micro-g induced alterations in cell-cycle kinetics that were characterized by prolonged S phase and reduced cyclin A expression. Differentiation of primitive CD34+ cells cultured for 14 to 18 days in RWV favored myeloid cell development at the expense of erythroid development, which was significantly reduced compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results illustrate that mmicro-g significantly inhibits the migration potential, cell-cycle progression, and differentiation patterns of primitive BM CD34+ cells, which may contribute to some of the hematologic abnormalities observed in humans during space flight.",Plett PA; Abonour R; Frankovitz SM; Orschell CM,NASA Discipline Cell Biotechnology; Non-NASA Center,2004,Experimental hematology,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,9737755,Rhinovirus replication in HeLa cells cultured under conditions of simulated microgravity.,"BACKGROUND: Rotating-wall vessels (RWVs) allow for the growth of cells under conditions of simulated microgravity. Information about the replication of viruses in simulated microgravity using RWVs has not been reported. Cells grown in RWVs are subjected to low shear motion, and the replication of certain viruses such as rhinoviruses has been reported to be enhanced by motion. HYPOTHESIS: Our research was based on the hypothesis that rhinovirus replication would be enhanced under conditions of simulated microgravity. METHODS: HeLa cells were cultured in three-dimensional cultures on microcarrier beads in simulated microgravity using RWVs and in sealed Teflon roller bottles. Two-dimensional cultures of HeLa cells were also grown in tissue culture flasks (T-150s). Viral infections for all cultures were carried out under standardized conditions at 1 x g. The amount of new virus released during the first viral replication cycle and the total viral yields obtained from multiple viral replication cycles were determined. RESULTS: Viral quantitation during the first viral replication cycle showed that after 10-13 h RWV and Teflon roller bottle supernatants contained significantly more virus than the supernatants from T-150 cultures. After multiple viral replication cycles (at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h following infection), total viral samples (both free and cell-associated virus) from RWV cultures contained significantly more virus than Teflon roller bottle cultures. CONCLUSIONS: The rhinovirus replication cycle was enhanced in cultures grown in the presence of motion (Teflon roller bottle cultures and RWV cultures). Additionally, multiple rounds of rhinovirus replication yielded more virus in simulated microgravity conditions. Viral transmission in cell cultures in RWVs was efficient and was similar to or better than what occurred in the Teflon roller bottles. The cultivation of cells in simulated microgravity possibly affected the rate of viral adsorption/uptake, the viral replication cycle, and/or the viral yield.

Vascular erosion is most frequently associated with left-sided CVC insertions. We report a case of hydropneumomediastinum and hydropneumothorax as a delayed complication of right-sided PICC used for total parenteral nutrition. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 77-year-old man with muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical cystectomy with uretero-ileostomy reconstruction (Bricker). The patient developed postoperative ileus, and thus, a right PICC was inserted for total parenteral nutrition. On postoperative day 8, he developed bilateral hydromediastinum, and bilateral thoracentesis was performed. After the procedure, he presented with respiratory and hemodynamic deterioration and was transferred to the intensive care unit for 12 days. The patient was eventually discharged and followed-up at the outpatient department. DISCUSSION: Ruptured SVC has been predominantly described in left-sided CVCs at the right angle of the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC. However, our patient is the second documented case of bilateral hydropneumothorax and hydropneumomediastinum as a delayed complication of a PICC used to administer total parenteral nutrition. Catheters may migrate from their initial position due to breathing, bloodstream flow dynamics, postural rotation, and neck movements. Chemical irritation of the vessel wall may be caused by hyperosmolar hyperalimentation fluid. CONCLUSION: A right-sided vascular approach is preferred to avoid friction complications, and the tip should be placed at the lower third of the vena cava to prevent vascular erosion.",Chica J; Ballén NP; Aguillon KJ; Rugeles SJ,Hydropneumomediastinum; Hydropneumothorax; Parenteral nutrition; Peripherally inserted central catheter,2021,International journal of surgery case reports,Journal Article,,

The identification and quantification of these characteristics are the keys to evaluate plaque vulnerability. However, single modality intravascular methods, such as intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography and photoacoustic, can hardly achieve all the comprehensive information to satisfy clinical needs. In this paper, for the first time, we developed a novel multi-spectral intravascular tri-modality (MS-IVTM) imaging system, which can perform 360° continuous rotation and pull-backing with a 0.9-mm miniature catheter and achieve simultaneous acquisition of both morphological characteristics and pathological compositions. Intravascular tri-modality imaging demonstrates the ability of our MS-IVTM system to provide macroscopic and microscopic structural information of the vessel wall, with identity and quantification of lipids with multi-wavelength excitation. This study offers clinicians and researchers a novel imaging tool to facilitate the accurate diagnosis of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. It also has the potential of clinical translations to help better identify and evaluate high-risk plaques during coronary interventions.

Replication of HuNoVs in human intestinal cell lines (INT-407 and Caco-2) that differentiate to produce microvilli in rotation wall vessel (RWV) three-dimensional cultures has been reported (Straub et al. in Emerg Infect Dis 13:396-403, 2007; J Water Health 9:225-240, 2011, and Water Sci Technol 67:863-868, 2013). We used a similar RWV system, intestinal cell lines, and the same (Genogroup [G] I.1) plus additional (GII.4 and GII.12) HuNoV strains to test the system's reproducibility and to expand the earlier findings. Apical microvilli were observed on the surface of both cell lines by light and electron microscopy. However, none of the cell types tested resulted in productive viral replication of any of the HuNoV strains, as confirmed by plateau or declining viral RNA titers in the supernatants and cell lysates of HuNoV-infected cells, determined by real-time reverse transcription PCR. These trends were the same when culture supplements were added that have been reported to be effective for replication of other fastidious enteric viruses in vitro. Additionally, by confocal microscopy and orthoslice analysis, viral capsid proteins were mainly observed above the actin filament signals, which suggested that the majority of viral antigens were on the cell surface. We conclude that even intestinal cells displaying microvilli were not sufficient to support HuNoV replication under the conditions tested.",Takanashi S; Saif LJ; Hughes JH; Meulia T; Jung K; Scheuer KA; Wang Q,,2014,Archives of virology,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",R21 AI081009/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,32111727,Virtual simulation with Sim&Size software for Pipeline Flex Embolization: evaluation of the technical and clinical impact.,"INTRODUCTION: During flow diversion, the choice of the length, diameter, and location of the deployed stent are critical for the success of the procedure. Sim&Size software, based on the three-dimensional rotational angiography (3D-RA) acquisition, simulates the release of the stent, suggesting optimal sizing, and displaying the degree of the wall apposition. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate technical and clinical impacts of the Sim&Size simulation during treatment with the Pipeline Flex Embolization Device. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent aneurysm embolization with Pipeline at our department were retrospectively enrolled (January 2015-December 2017) and divided into two groups: treated with and without simulation. Through univariate and multivariate models, we evaluated: (1) rate of corrective intervention for non-optimal stent placement, (2) duration of intervention, (3) radiation dose, and (4) stent length. RESULTS: 189 patients, 95 (50.2%) without and 94 (49.7%) with software assistance were analyzed. Age, sex, comorbidities, aneurysm characteristics, and operator's experience were comparable among the two groups. Procedures performed with the software had a lower rate of corrective intervention (9% vs 20%, p=0.036), a shorter intervention duration (46 min vs 52 min, p=0.002), a lower median radiation dose (1150 mGy vs 1558 mGy, p<0.001), and a shorter stent length (14 mm vs 16 mm, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the use of the virtual simulation during Pipeline treatment significantly reduced the need for corrective intervention, the procedural time, the radiation dose, and the length of the stent. permissions.

rotating_wall,33889320,Coronary intravascular lithotripsy for coronary artery calcifications- systematic review of cases.,"Background: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a pathological deposition of calcium in the intimal and medial layer of the arterial wall. A plethora of therapeutic calcium debulking techniques is available for the treatment of CAC, including orbital or rotational atherectomy, excimer lasers, cutting, and scoring balloons, which are associated with a soaring rate of complication and low efficacy. To this end, in 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) posited that shockwave intravascular lithotripsy (S-IVL) technique can be employed with minimal complication. Methods: A retrospective review of cases received lithotripsy for calcified coronary artery disease was performed by using online data from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The available search results were downloaded into an Endnote library and analyzed into two phases. Results: Out of 24 participants from case reports and series, Majority were found to be Male. There was no significant difference found in the mortality of patients undergoing IVL for the stenosis of the left main stem, left anterior descending, left circumflex artery, or diagonal branch. The mortality was found to be high among 6 patients with prior comorbidities and underwent more than 3 cycles of IVL (OR 37,95% Cl 1.54-886.04, P 0.02). Out of 24 patients, 2 (8.33%) patients developed complications such as vessel dissection (OR 3.4, 95% Cl 17.87-64.68, P 0.4). Conclusion: Shockwave intravascular lithotripsy (S-IVL) may be used in cases of the calcified disease to gain vessel lumen in order to deploy drug-eluting stents with PCI. The success of the DES implantation of IVL can be 100% with a minimal complication rate.

rotating_wall,7924506,Bilateral vs single internal thoracic artery grafting for left main coronary artery occlusion.,"This study was conducted to compare the coronary flow distributed by single and bilateral internal thoracic artery (ITA) grafts in the setting of the left main coronary occlusion. Ten dogs underwent coronary artery bypass grafting through a left thoracotomy, off pump, using a brief local occlusion to perform the anastomosis. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive either a single left ITA (LITA) graft to the circumflex coronary artery (CFX), or bilateral ITA grafts, with additional placement of the right ITA (RITA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). After the grafts were placed, the left main coronary artery was ligated. Electromagnetic flows were obtained in the LAD and the CFX proximally and distally to ITA grafts in both groups before grafting and after grafting. ITA flow in situ was also measured before rotation from the chest wall. Total left ventricular flow requirements were satisfied equally well by either a single LITA graft (116.7 +/- 11.6 mL/min) or bilateral ITA grafts (total, 116.8 +/- 9.6 mL/min divided as LITA, 55.9 +/- 7.4 mL/min; RITA, 60.9 +/- 12.0 mL/min). When two grafts were replaced, competitive flow in the proximal regions of both native vessels was noted, although basal flow requirements were maintained. When an individual graft was occluded in the bilaterally grafted system, the remaining graft immediately recruited the additional flow, demonstrating that either right or left ITA can support flow demands five to six times higher than in situ chest wall flow (RITA, 21.9 +/- 3.1 mL/min; LITA, 22.3 +/- 4.9 mL/min). These data suggest that in this canine model, a single ITA graft can support the entire flow requirements of the left ventricle. Assuming no intervening stenosis is present in native coronary systems, bilateral ITA grafting may provide a margin of safety, but under resting conditions, provides no perfusion advantages over a single ITA graft.",Otaki M; Lust RM; Sun YS; Norton TO; Spence PA; Zeri RS; Hopson SB; Chitwood R Jr,,1994,Chest,Comparative Study; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,30817172,The dynamic adaptation of primary human endothelial cells to simulated microgravity.,"Culture of human endothelial cells for 10 d in real microgravity onboard the International Space Station modulated more than 1000 genes, some of which are involved in stress response. On Earth, 24 h after exposure to simulated microgravity, endothelial cells up-regulate heat shock protein (HSP) 70. To capture a broad view of endothelial stress response to gravitational unloading, we cultured primary human endothelial cells for 4 and 10 d in the rotating wall vessel, a U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration-developed surrogate system for benchtop microgravity research on Earth. We highlight the crucial role of the early increase of HSP70 because its silencing markedly impairs cell survival. Once HSP70 up-regulation fades away after 4 d of simulated microgravity, a complex and articulated increase of various stress proteins (sirtuin 2, paraoxonase 2, superoxide dismutase 2, p21, HSP27, and phosphorylated HSP27, all endowed with cytoprotective properties) occurs and counterbalances the up-regulation of the pro-oxidant thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP). Interestingly, TXNIP was the most overexpressed transcript in endothelial cells after spaceflight. We conclude that HSP70 up-regulation sustains the initial adaptive response of endothelial cells to mechanical unloading and drives them toward the acquisition of a novel phenotype that maintains cell viability and function through the sequential involvement of different stress proteins.-Cazzaniga, A., Locatelli, L., Castiglioni, S., Maier, J.

rotating_wall,28649632,Three-dimensional organotypic co-culture model of intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages to study Salmonella enterica colonization patterns.,"Three-dimensional models of human intestinal epithelium mimic the differentiated form and function of parental tissues often not exhibited by two-dimensional monolayers and respond to Salmonella in key ways that reflect in vivo infections. To further enhance the physiological relevance of three-dimensional models to more closely approximate in vivo intestinal microenvironments encountered by Salmonella, we developed and validated a novel three-dimensional co-culture infection model of colonic epithelial cells and macrophages using the NASA Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor. First, U937 cells were activated upon collagen-coated scaffolds. HT-29 epithelial cells were then added and the three-dimensional model was cultured in the bioreactor until optimal differentiation was reached, as assessed by immunohistochemical profiling and bead uptake assays. The new co-culture model exhibited in vivo-like structural and phenotypic characteristics, including three-dimensional architecture, apical-basolateral polarity, well-formed tight/adherens junctions, mucin, multiple epithelial cell types, and functional macrophages. Phagocytic activity of macrophages was confirmed by uptake of inert, bacteria-sized beads. Contribution of macrophages to infection was assessed by colonization studies of Salmonella pathovars with different host adaptations and disease phenotypes (Typhimurium ST19 strain SL1344 and ST313 strain D23580; Typhi Ty2). ﻿﻿In addition, Salmonella were cultured aerobically or microaerobically, recapitulating environments encountered prior to and during intestinal infection, respectively﻿. All Salmonella strains exhibited decreased colonization in co-culture (HT-29-U937) relative to epithelial (HT-29) models, indicating antimicrobial function of macrophages. Interestingly, D23580 exhibited enhanced replication/survival in both models following invasion. Pathovar-specific differences in colonization and intracellular co-localization patterns were observed. These findings emphasize the power of incorporating a series of related three-dimensional models within a study to identify microenvironmental factors important for regulating infection.",Barrila J; Yang J; Crabbé A; Sarker SF; Liu Y; Ott CM; Nelman-Gonzalez MA; Clemett SJ; Nydam SD; Forsyth RJ; Davis RR; Crucian BE; Quiriarte H; Roland KL; Brenneman K; Sams C; Loscher C; Nickerson CA,,2017,NPJ microgravity,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,25962111,Recellularization of decellularized lung scaffolds is enhanced by dynamic suspension culture.,"Strategies are needed to improve repopulation of decellularized lung scaffolds with stromal and functional epithelial cells. We demonstrate that decellularized mouse lungs recellularized in a dynamic low fluid shear suspension bioreactor, termed the rotating wall vessel (RWV), contained more cells with decreased apoptosis, increased proliferation and enhanced levels of total RNA compared to static recellularization conditions. These results were observed with two relevant mouse cell types: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) and alveolar type II cells (C10). In addition, MSCs cultured in decellularized lungs under static but not bioreactor conditions formed multilayered aggregates. Gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses suggested differentiation of MSCs into collagen I-producing fibroblast-like cells in the bioreactor, indicating enhanced potential for remodeling of the decellularized scaffold matrix. In conclusion, dynamic suspension culture is promising for enhancing repopulation of decellularized lungs, and could contribute to remodeling the extracellular matrix of the scaffolds with subsequent effects on differentiation and functionality of inoculated cells.",Crabbé A; Liu Y; Sarker SF; Bonenfant NR; Barrila J; Borg ZD; Lee JJ; Weiss DJ; Nickerson CA,,2015,PloS one,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",RC4 HL106625/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; RC4HL106625/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; P30 GM103532/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States; R21HL108689/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; R21HL094611/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; R21 HL108689/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; R21 HL094611/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,19811095,Dynamic three-dimensional culture methods enhance mesenchymal stem cell properties and increase therapeutic potential.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are capable of self-renewal and differentiation along the osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic lineages and have potential applications in a range of therapies. MSCs can be cultured as monolayers on tissue culture plastic, but there are indications that they lose cell-specific properties with time in vitro and so poorly reflect in vivo MSC behavior. We developed dynamic three-dimensional (3D) techniques for in vitro MSC culture using spinner flasks and a rotating wall vessel bioreactor. We characterized the two methods for dynamic 3D MSC culture and compared the properties of these cultures with monolayer MSCs. Our results showed that under optimal conditions, MSCs form compact cellular spheroids and remain viable in dynamic 3D culture. We demonstrated altered cell size and surface antigen expression together with enhanced osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential in MSCs from dynamic 3D conditions. By microarray analysis of monolayer and spinner flask MSCs, we identified many differences in gene expression, including those confirming widespread changes to the cellular architecture and extracellular matrix. The upregulation of interleukin 24 in dynamic 3D cultures was shown to selectively impair the viability of prostate cancer cells cultured in medium conditioned by dynamic 3D MSCs. Overall, this work suggests a novel therapeutic application for dynamic 3D MSCs and demonstrates that these methods are a viable alternative to monolayer techniques and may prove beneficial for retaining MSC properties in vitro.",Frith JE; Thomson B; Genever PG,,2010,"Tissue engineering.

rotating_wall,19626337,The influence of leptin on the activity of lung lymphocytes under simulated microgravity.,"Exposure to microgravity has been implicated in the compromised immune function in space travellers, resulting in opportunistic infections, poor wound healing, and cancer. Since recent studies have suggested that leptin was capable of modulating immune responses, the purpose of this study was to examine effects of microgravity on the activation and proliferation of rat lung lymphocytes and then to examine the effects of leptin-mediated signal transduction mechanisms of lymphocyte activation in these same conditions. In control conditions (T-flasks cultured cells) leptin was not able by itself to increase lymphocytes proliferation, or induce significant increase of either IL-2 production or expression of lymphocytes activation markers, such as CD25 and CD71, while it markedly enhanced the positive effects induced on these parameters by concanavalin A (ConA). Using clinostatic rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors to simulate a microgravity environment, we found that ConA responsiveness was inhibited. Moreover, under these conditions, leptin was not able to reverse these impaired functions. Accordingly with the above cited inhibitory effects exerted by the simulated microgravity environment, evidence was also obtained of defects in lymphocyte intracellular signal transduction induced by the incubation in RWV bioreactors, namely concerning decreased ConA-mediated PKC activity, and reduced expression of NF-kappaB, c-fos, and ERK1/2. Again, leptin appeared to be unable in restoring a physiologic increase of these parameters, different from what could be observed after complementation of the ConA-mediated signalling with phorbol myristate acetate, which instead demonstrated to overcome the inhibition of lymphocytes activating functions, in the presence of simulated microgravity conditions.",Li X; Liu CT; Zhou H,,2009,European journal of applied physiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,33255352,Scalable Microgravity Simulator Used for Long-Term Musculoskeletal Cells and Tissue Engineering.,"We introduce a new benchtop microgravity simulator (MGS) that is scalable and easy to use. Its working principle is similar to that of random positioning machines (RPM), commonly used in research laboratories and regarded as one of the gold standards for simulating microgravity. The improvement of the MGS concerns mainly the algorithms controlling the movements of the samples and the design that, for the first time, guarantees equal treatment of all the culture flasks undergoing simulated microgravity. Qualification and validation tests of the new device were conducted with human bone marrow stem cells (bMSC) and mouse skeletal muscle myoblasts (C2C12). bMSC were cultured for 4 days on the MGS and the RPM in parallel. In the presence of osteogenic medium, an overexpression of osteogenic markers was detected in the samples from both devices. Similarly, C2C12 cells were maintained for 4 days on the MGS and the rotating wall vessel (RWV) device, another widely used microgravity simulator. Significant downregulation of myogenesis markers was observed in gravitationally unloaded cells. Therefore, similar results can be obtained regardless of the used simulated microgravity devices, namely MGS, RPM, or RWV. The newly developed MGS device thus offers easy and reliable long-term cell culture possibilities under simulated microgravity conditions. Currently, upgrades are in progress to allow real-time monitoring of the culture media and liquids exchange while running. This is of particular interest for long-term cultivation, needed for tissue engineering applications. Tissue grown under real or simulated microgravity has specific features, such as growth in three-dimensions (3D).

In r- and s-µg, various cell types were found to form 3D structures. This review will focus on the current knowledge of tissue engineering in space and on Earth using systems such as the random positioning machine (RPM), the 2D-clinostat, or the NASA-developed rotating wall vessel bioreactor (RWV) to create tissue from bone, tumor, and mesenchymal stem cells. To understand the development of 3D structures, in vitro experiments using s-µg devices can provide valuable information about modulations in signal-transduction, cell adhesion, or extracellular matrix induced by altered gravity conditions. These systems also facilitate the analysis of the impact of growth factors, hormones, or drugs on these tissue-like constructs. Progress has been made in bone tissue engineering using the RWV, and multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS), formed in both r- and s-µg, have been reported and were analyzed in depth.

Compared with uninfected cells, transmission micrographs of norovirus-infected cells displayed evidence of shortening or total loss of apical microvilli, and vacuolization. Quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) indicated an approximate 2-3 log10 increase in viral RNA copies for the infected cells. A passage experiment examined both the ability for continued viral RNA and viral antigen detection. In the passaged samples 1.01x10(6) copies ml(-1) were detected by qRT-PCR. Immune electron microscopy using primary antibody to hNoV GI.1 capsids in conjunction with 6 nm gold-labelled secondary antibodies was performed on crude cellular lysates. Localization of antibody was observed in infected but not for uninfected cells.

rotating_wall,20717918,Microarray profile of gene expression during osteoclast differentiation in modelled microgravity.,"Microgravity (µXg) leads to a 10-15% loss of bone mass in astronauts during space flight. Osteoclast (OCL) is the multinucleated bone-resorbing cell. In this study, we used the NASA developed ground-based rotating wall vessel bioreactor (RWV), rotary cell culture system (RCCS) to simulate µXg conditions and demonstrated a significant increase (2-fold) in osteoclastogenesis compared to normal gravity control (Xg). Gene expression profiling of RAW 264.7 OCL progenitor cells in modelled µXg by Agilent microarray analysis revealed significantly increased expression of critical molecules such as cytokines/growth factors, proteases and signalling proteins, which play an important role in enhanced OCL differentiation/function. Transcription factors such as c-Jun, MITF and CREB implicated in OCL differentiation are upregulated; however no significant change in the levels of NFATc1 expression in preosteoclast cells subjected to modelled µXg. We also identified high-level expression of calcium-binding protein, S100A8 (calcium-binding protein molecule A8/calgranulin A) in preosteoclast cells under µXg. Furthermore, modelled µXg stimulated RAW 264.7 cells showed elevated cytosolic calcium (Ca(2+)) levels/oscillations compared to Xg cells. siRNA knock-down of S100A8 expression in RAW 264.7 cells resulted in a significant decrease in modelled µXg stimulated OCL differentiation. We also identified elevated levels of phospho-CREB in preosteoclast cells subjected to modelled µXg compared to Xg. Thus, modelled µXg regulated gene expression profiling in preosteoclast cells provide new insights into molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of enhanced OCL differentiation/activation to prevent bone loss and fracture risk in astronauts during space flight missions.",Sambandam Y; Blanchard JJ; Daughtridge G; Kolb RJ; Shanmugarajan S; Pandruvada SN; Bateman TA; Reddy SV,,2010,Journal of cellular biochemistry,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,34512577,Effects of Simulated Microgravity on the Physiology of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Multiomic Analysis.,"Many studies have shown that the space environment plays a pivotal role in changing the characteristics of conditional pathogens, especially their pathogenicity and virulence. However, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, a type of conditional pathogen that has shown to a gradual increase in clinical morbidity in recent years, has rarely been reported for its impact in space. In this study, S. maltophilia was exposed to a simulated microgravity (SMG) environment in high-aspect ratio rotating-wall vessel bioreactors for 14days, while the control group was exposed to the same bioreactors in a normal gravity (NG) environment. Then, combined phenotypic, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses were conducted to compare the influence of the SMG and NG on S. maltophilia. The results showed that S. maltophilia in simulated microgravity displayed an increased growth rate, enhanced biofilm formation ability, increased swimming motility, and metabolic alterations compared with those of S. maltophilia in normal gravity and the original strain of S. maltophilia. Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) annotation analysis indicated that the increased growth rate might be related to the upregulation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in energy metabolism and conversion, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport and catabolism, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses showed that the increased motility might be associated the upregulation of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) involved in locomotion, localization, biological adhesion, and binding, in accordance with the upregulated DEGs in cell motility according to COG classification, including pilP, pilM, flgE, flgG, and ronN. Additionally, the increased biofilm formation ability might be associated with the upregulation of DEPs involved in biofilm formation, the bacterial secretion system, biological adhesion, and cell adhesion, which were shown to be regulated by the differentially expressed genes (chpB, chpC, rpoN, pilA, pilG, pilH, and pilJ) through the integration of transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. These results suggested that simulated microgravity might increase the level of corresponding functional proteins by upregulating related genes to alter physiological characteristics and modulate growth rate, motility, biofilm formation, and metabolism. In conclusion, this study is the first general analysis of the phenotypic, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic changes in S. maltophilia under simulated microgravity and provides some suggestions for future studies of space microbiology.",Su X; Guo Y; Fang T; Jiang X; Wang D; Li D; Bai P; Zhang B; Wang J; Liu C,Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; biofilm; mobility; multiomic analysis; physiology; simulated microgravity,2021,Frontiers in microbiology,Journal Article,,

Scaffolds with controlled internal pore structures were produced from computer-aided design (CAD) models and solid freeform fabrication (SFF) technique, while those with random pore structures were fabricated by a NaCl leaching technique for comparison. The morphology and mechanical properties of scaffolds were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mechanical testing, respectively. Pore interconnectivity of scaffolds was assessed using X-ray microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and 3D imaging analysis. In vitro cell studies have been performed using MC3T3-E1 mouse preosteoblasts and cultured scaffolds in a rotating-wall-vessel bioreactor for 4 and 7 days to assess cell attachment, viability, ingrowth depth, and proliferation. The mechanical properties of cross-linked nanocomposite scaffolds were not significantly different after adding HA or varying pore structures. However, pore interconnectivity of PPF/HA nanocomposite scaffolds with controlled pore structures has been significantly increased, resulting in enhanced cell ingrowth depth 7 days after cell seeding. Cell attachment and proliferation are also higher in PPF/HA nanocomposite scaffolds.

Such cells have been isolated from the embryonic brain and immobilized in three dimensional collagen gels. The collagen-entrapped NSCs/NPs recapitulate CNS stem cell development and form functional synapses and neuronal circuits. However, the cell-collagen constructs from static conditions contain hypoxic, necrotic cores and the cells are short-lived. In the present study, NSCs/NPs isolated from embryonic day 13 rat cortical neuroepithelium are immobilized in type I collagen gels and cultured in NASA-designed rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors for up to 9 weeks. Initially, during the first 2 weeks of culture, a lag phase of cellular growth and differentiation is observed in the RWV bioreactors. Accelerated growth and differentiation, with the cells beginning to form large aggregates (approximately 1 mm in diameter) without death cores, begins during the third week. The collagen-entrapped NSCs/NPs cultured in RWV show active neuronal generation followed by astrocyte production. After 6 weeks in rotary culture, the cell-collagen constructs contain over 10 fold greater nestin+ and GFAP+ cells and two-fold more TuJ1 gene expression than those found in static cultures. In addition, TuJ1+ neurons in RWV culture give rise to extensive neurite outgrowth and considerably more synapsin I+ pre-synaptic puncta surrounding MAP2+ cell bodies and dendrites. These results strongly suggest that the cell-collagen-bioreactor culture system supports long-term NSC/NP growth and differentiation, and RWV bioreactors can be useful in generating neural tissue like constructs, which may have the potential for cell replacement therapy.",Lin HJ; O'Shaughnessy TJ; Kelly J; Ma W,NASA Discipline Cell Biotechnology; Non-NASA Center,2004,Brain research.

Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic angiography was performed using retrospective electrocardiographic gating. Scan length was 22 to 30 cm, and total scan time was 27 to 37 seconds. RESULTS: Of the 14 patients, 8 were scanned within 1 week after operation and 6, 1 month to 12 months postoperatively. Average heart rate during the scan was 82 beats per minute (range, 60 to 97 beats per minute), and all patients were able to hold their breath for the required time. Thirty conduits were studied: 26 arterial (18 in situ left and right internal mammary artery grafts, five free right internal mammary and radial artery grafts, and three in situ right gastroepiploic artery grafts) and four vein grafts. Excellent visualization of all 30 grafts was achieved. Thirty-four of the 35 distal anastomoses were patent; one vein graft was occluded. CONCLUSIONS: This new technology is a promising noninvasive measure to evaluate patency of bypass conduits, including the gastroepiploic artery where catheterization is usually difficult. The ability to display the vessel wall as well as its lumen might distinguish radial artery spasm from intimal hyperplasia. The superb resolution and increased scan length required to cover the entire internal mammary artery grafts-from origin to distal anastomoses-can be achieved easily in a single breath-holding owing to the increased number of slices per rotation and shortening of the gantry rotation time.",Gurevitch J; Gaspar T; Orlov B; Amar R; Dvir D; Peled N; Aravot DJ,,2003,The Annals of thoracic surgery,Comparative Study; Evaluation Study; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,11332740,Proliferation of human hematopoietic bone marrow cells in simulated microgravity.,"Expansion and/or maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) potential following in vitro culture remains a major obstacle in stem cell biology and bone marrow (BM) transplantation. Several studies suggest that culture of mammalian cells in microgravity (micro-g) may reduce proliferation and differentiation of these cells. We investigated the application of these findings to the field of stem cell biology in the hopes of expanding HSC with minimal loss of hematopoietic function. To this end, BM CD34+ cells were cultured for 4-6 d in rotating wall vessels for simulation of micro-g, and assessed for expansion, cell cycle activation, apoptosis, and hematopoietic potential. While CD34+ cells cultured in normal gravity (1-g) proliferated up to threefold by day 4-6, cells cultured in micro-g did not increase in number. As a possible explanation for this, cells cultured in simulated micro-g were found to exit G0/G1 phase of cell cycle at a slower rate than 1-g controls. When assayed for primitive hematopoietic potential in secondary conventional 1-g long-term cultures, cells from initial micro-g cultures produced greater numbers of cells and progenitors, and for a longer period of time, than cultures initiated with 1-g control cells. Similar low levels of apoptosis and adhesion molecule phenotype in micro-g and 1-g-cultured cells suggested similar growth patterns in the two settings. These data begin to elucidate the effects of micro-g on proliferation of human hematopoietic cells and may be potentially beneficial to the fields of stem cell biology and somatic gene therapy.",Plett PA; Frankovitz SM; Abonour R; Orschell-Traycoff CM,,2001,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

rotating_wall,11409687,Epstein-Barr virus latently infected cells are selectively deleted in simulated-microgravity cultures.,"Rotating-wall vessels (RWVs) allow for the cultivation of cells in simulated microgravity. Previously, we showed that the cultivation of lymphoblastoid cells in simulated microgravity results in the suppression of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation. To determine if the suppression generated by simulated microgravity could be reversed by changing to static culture conditions, cells were cultured in an RRWV for 5 d, and then switched to static conditions. Following the switch to static conditions, viral reactivation remained suppressed (significantly lower) relative to static control cultures over a 4-d period. Additionally, experiments were conducted to determine if chemical treatment could induce viral reactivation in cells from simulated-microgravity cultures. Cells were cultured in static flask cultures and in simulated microgravity in RWVs for 4-7 d. The cells were then transferred to 50-cm3 tubes, and treated with 3 mM n-butyrate for 48 h, or 18 ng/ml of phorbol ester, viz., 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate (TPA) for either 2 or 48 h, under static conditions. Although EBV was inducible, the cells from simulated-microgravity cultures treated with n-butyrate displayed significantly lower levels of viral-antigen expression compared with the treated cells from static cultures. Also, incubation with TPA for 2-3 h, but not for 48 h, reactivated EBV in cells from RWV cultures. In contrast, EBV was inducible in cells from static cultures treated for either 2-3 or 48 h with TPA. TPA reactivation of EBV following a 2-3-h period of treatment indicates that the protein kinase C signal-transduction pathway is not impaired in lymphoblastoid cells cultured in simulated microgravity. However, the exposure of B-lymphoblastoid cells from simulated-microgravity cultures to TPA for more than 3-4 h triggered a lytic event (apoptosis or necrosis), which prevented replication of the virus. Thus, EBV-infected cells in simulated microgravity were negatively selected in the absence of any cytotoxic cells.",Long JP; Hughes JH,,2001,In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

rotating_wall,19744087,"Adaptative or maladaptative hypertrophy, different spatial distribution of myocardial contraction.","SUMMARY BACKGROUND: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) may be an adaptative remodelling process induced by physical training, or result from pathological stimuli. We hypothesized that different LVH aetiology could lead to dissimilar spatial distribution left ventricular (LV) contraction, and compared different components of LV contraction using 2-dimensional (2-D) speckle tracking derived strain in subjects with adaptative hypertrophy (endurance athletes), maladaptative hypertrophy (hypertensive patients) and healthy controls. METHOD: We enrolled 22 patients with essential hypertension, 50 endurance athletes and 24 healthy controls. All subjects underwent traditional echocardiography and 2-D strain evaluation of LV longitudinal, circumferential and radial function. LV basal and apical rotation and their net difference, defined as LV torsion, were evaluated. RESULTS: LV wall thicknesses, LV mass and left atrium diameter were comparable between hypertensive group and athletes. LV longitudinal strain was reduced only in hypertensive patients (P < 0.05). LV apex circumferential strain was higher in hypertensive patients than in other groups (P < 0.001), LV basal circumferential strain, although slightly increased, did not reach significant difference. Hypertensive patients showed significantly increased rotation and torsion (P < 0.001), while no differences were observed between athletes and control. CONCLUSION: In patients with pathological LVH, LV longitudinal strain was reduced, while circumferential deformation and torsion were increased. No differences were observed in LV contractile function between subjects with adaptative LVH and controls. In pathological LVH, increasing torsion could be considered a compensatory mechanism to counterbalance contraction and relaxation abnormalities to maintain a normal LV output.",Cappelli F; Toncelli L; Cappelli B; De Luca A; Stefani L; Maffulli N; Galanti G,,2010,Clinical physiology and functional imaging,Comparative Study; Controlled Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Validation Study,,
rotating_wall,12130452,Standard-dose and 50%-reduced-dose chest CT: comparing the effect on image quality.,"OBJECTIVE: CT accounts for considerable population-based radiation dose from radiographic diagnostic studies. The technical factors for CT examinations are not appropriately adjusted on the basis of patient size and anatomy. We hypothesized that radiation doses for routine chest CT can be reduced by 50% for the evaluation of normal structures without seriously jeopardizing image quality. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After receiving institutional review board approval, we prospectively studied 24 patients with cancer who were 65 years old and older on a multidetector CT scanner. Each patient underwent imaging with four slices (centered at the carina) at the standard dose (220-280 mAs) and at 50%-reduced dose (110-140 mAs) at a constant 140 kVp. Single breath-hold scanning was performed with a 2.5-mm detector configuration, a tube rotation time of 0.8 sec, and a pitch of 6:1. Contiguous images were reconstructed at 5-mm intervals. Two subspecialty-trained chest radiologists who were unaware of the CT technique reviewed randomized images for overall image quality and anatomic detail of the structures in the lung, airway, mediastinum, and chest wall using a 5-point scale (1, worst; 2, suboptimal; 3, adequate; 4, very good; 5, excellent). The data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon's signed rank test. RESULTS: Although overall image quality was better with standard-dose CT, the quality of reduced-dose CT was acceptable. The differences in mean scores were statistically significant. There was a correlation of 0.59 between observers. The mean scores of standard-dose CT were always greater than or equivalent to those of low-dose CT for both observers. The assessment of great vessels and soft tissue of the chest wall contributed mainly to the differences in image quality. Both the central and peripheral lung parenchyma and the airway were adequately visualized on low-dose CT. Radiation doses (based on weighted-CT-dose index) from standard-dose CT and 50%-reduced-dose CT were 15.6-21.4 mSv and 7.8-10.7 mSv, respectively (from the manufacturer's data). CONCLUSION: Chest CT image quality appears to be acceptable for evaluating normal anatomic structures even with a 50% reduction in radiation dose.",Prasad SR; Wittram C; Shepard JA; McLoud T; Rhea J,,2002,AJR.

rotating_wall,15838803,Invasion of human tissue ex vivo by Borrelia burgdorferi.,"Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto is an etiological agent of Lyme disease. The lack of an adequate ex vivo system for human tissue infection is an obstacle to fully understanding the molecular mechanisms of invasion of tissue by B. burgdorferi and its adaptation within the human host. Here, we report on the development of such a system. We inoculated blocks of human tonsillar tissue with B. burgdorferi spirochetes, cultured them in a low-shear rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, and analyzed them using light and electron microscopy, nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and quantitative real-time PCR. Also, we evaluated the expression of the outer surface proteins (Osps) OspA and OspC by use of quantitative Western blotting. Light and electron microscopic analysis revealed multiple spirochetes localized extracellularly within the tissue, and their identity was confirmed by PCR. Quantification of spirochetes inside the RWV-cultured tonsillar tissue demonstrated that the number of B. burgdorferi exceeded the initial inoculum by an order of magnitude, indicating that spirochetes replicated in the tissue. Electron microscopic analysis showed that some spirochetes were arranged in cystic structures and that invading spirochetes differentially expressed surface proteins; both of these features have been described for infected tissues in vivo. The system we have developed can be used to study B. burgdorferi pathogenesis under controlled conditions ex vivo, in particular to explore the gene activation responsible for the adaptation of B. burgdorferi to human tissue that leads to Lyme disease.",Duray PH; Yin SR; Ito Y; Bezrukov L; Cox C; Cho MS; Fitzgerald W; Dorward D; Zimmerberg J; Margolis L,NASA Discipline Cell Biotechnology; Non-NASA Center,2005,The Journal of infectious diseases,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",Intramural NIH HHS/United States,

We generated the transplantable, tissue-like aggregates composed of Sertoli cells and islets in rotating wall vessel bioreactors, SICA (Sertoli-islet cell aggregates), to improve their biological function in vitro and in vivo. The isolated islet equivalent and Sertoli cells were purified from Wistar rats and cocultured for 5 days in bioreactor to generate SICA. The SICA, islets aggregates, and fresh isolated islets were transplanted under the kidney capsule of diabetic Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, respectively. The functions of different grafts were ascertained by blood glucose level measurements and an in vivo glucose tolerance test. In response to elevated glucose, insulin secretion from SICA was 1.4-fold higher (P<0.05, n=5) than islet aggregates cultured alone. Of the rats that received SICA, 90% (9/10) remained normoglycemic at 60 days post-transplantation, and the survival significantly increased compared with recipients bearing homotypic islets aggregates or freshly isolated islets. The former responded similarly with healthy rats to the glucose tolerance test.

Biocompatible and biodegradable scaffolds seeded with living cells are used to create functional tissue for load-bearing bone reconstruction. The aim of this study was to manufacture cell-seeded 3-dimensional bone constructs based on hydroxyapatite ceramic granule calcified from red algae and mesenchymal cambial-layer precursor cells. The ability of these cells to grow on hydroxyapatite ceramic was quantitatively investigated to evaluate 3-dimensional bone constructs for their potential use in bone tissue engineering. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mesenchymal cambial-layer precursor cells were isolated from mandibular periosteum biopsy samples of 3 patients. To manufacture 72 bone constructs, these cells and hydroxyapatite ceramic granules (C GRAFT/Algipore; Clinician's Preference LLC, Golden, CO) were cultivated under osteogenic differentiation conditions in a rotating wall vessel system. After 6 and 21 days, histologic examination and scanning electron microscopy were performed. The absolute DNA content, protein synthesis, and alkaline phosphatase activity were also quantified. The osteoblastic phenotype of the constructs was confirmed by the expression of bone-specific genes (osteocalcin, osteonectin, osteopontin, and core binding factor alpha1) using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Cells within the constructs showed good viability, which was evidenced by an increase in DNA content over the culture period. The decrease in alkaline phosphatase-specific activity could be an indicator of the maturation of cells and the induction of mineralization. The osteoblastic phenotype of the constructs was demonstrated on protein and at the RNA level over the entire culture period. CONCLUSION: We observed a positive effect of hydroxyapatite ceramic granules on mesenchymal cambial-layer precursor cell behavior in cell-seeded 3-dimensional bone constructs, indicating the potential applicability of C GRAFT/Algipore composites in bone tissue engineering.",Turhani D; Watzinger E; Weissenböck M; Cvikl B; Thurnher D; Wittwer G; Yerit K; Ewers R,,2005,Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,31584963,LRP receptors in chondrocytes are modulated by simulated microgravity and cyclic hydrostatic pressure.,"Mechanical loading is essential for the maintenance of musculoskeletal homeostasis. Cartilage has been demonstrated to be highly mechanoresponsive, but the mechanisms by which chondrocytes respond to mechanical stimuli are not clearly understood. The goal of the study was to determine how LRP4, LRP5, and LRP6 within canonical Wnt-signaling are regulated in simulated microgravity and cyclic hydrostatic pressure, and to investigate the potential role of LRP 4/5/6 in cartilage degeneration. Rat chondrosacroma cell (RCS) pellets were stimulated using either cyclic hydrostatic pressure (1Hz, 7.5 MPa, 4hr/day) or simulated microgravity in a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor (11RPM, 24hr/day). LRP4/5/6 mRNA expression was assessed by RT-qPCR and LRP5 protein expression was determined by fluorescent immunostaining. To further evaluate our in vitro findings in vivo, mice were subjected to hindlimb suspension for 14 days and the femoral heads stained for LRP5 expression. We found that, in vitro, LRP4/5/6 mRNA expression is modulated in a time-dependent manner by mechanical stimulation. Additionally, LRP5 protein expression is upregulated in response to both simulated microgravity and cyclic hydrostatic pressure. LRP5 is also upregulated in vivo in the articular cartilage of hindlimb suspended mice. This is the first study to examine how LRP4/5/6, critical receptors within musculoskeletal biology, respond to mechanical stimulation.

This study was to find out metastasis-associated genes between two 3D HCC spheroids with different metastasis potential using comparative PCR arrays. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two HCC spheroids derived from high-metastatic MHCC97H cells and low-metastatic Hep3B cells were formed respectively in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor after 3D culture for 15 days. The candidate metastasis-associated genes related to cell adhesion, matrix secretion and invasion in HCC spheroids were screened by RT² profiler PCR arrays. The expression patterns of several differentially-expressed genes were further confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Total of 123 differential expression genes (fold-change>2) were found between two HCC spheroids, including 70 up-regulated genes (VCAM-1, IL-1β, CD44, tenascin C, SPP1, fibronectin, MMP-2, MMP-7, etc) and 53 down-regulated genes (E-cadherin, CTNND2, etc) in the high-metastatic spheroid. Function classification showed that the number of up-regulated genes related to adhesion molecules mediating cell-matrix interactions and matrix secretion was significantly higher in high-metastatic spheroid than that in low-metastatic spheroid. In contrast, the expressions of adhesion molecules maintaining homotypic tumor cell adhesion were decreased in metastatic spheroid as compared with that in low-metastatic spheroid. In addition, the expression pattern of seven selected genes associated with tumor metastasis measured by real-time RT-PCR were consistent with results of PCR arrays. CONCLUSIONS: Obvious differences between two HCC spheroids in gene expression patterns of adhesion molecules, matrix secretion, invasion and other molecules may determine the different metastatic characteristics and malignant phenotype of HCC spheroid.",Chen R; Dong Y; Xie X; Chen J; Gao D; Liu Y; Ren Z; Cui J,Hepatocellular carcinoma; metastasis; spheroid; three-dimensional culture,2014,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

However, the medical significance of this finding to pulmonary disease remains unclear since the multicellular complexity of the lung was not considered in the assessment of macrophage responses to 3-oxo-C(12) HSL. We developed a novel three-dimensional co-culture model of alveolar epithelium and macrophages using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, by adding undifferentiated monocytes to RWV-derived alveolar epithelium. Our three-dimensional model expressed important architectural/phenotypic hallmarks of the parental tissue, as evidenced by highly differentiated epithelium, spontaneous differentiation of monocytes to functional macrophage-like cells, localization of these cells on the alveolar surface and a macrophage-to-epithelial cell ratio relevant to the in vivo situation. Co-cultivation of macrophages with alveolar epithelium counteracted 3-oxo-C(12) HSL-induced cytotoxicity via removal of quorum sensing molecules by alveolar cells. Furthermore, 3-oxo-C(12) HSL induced the intercellular adhesion molecule ICAM-1 in both alveolar epithelium and macrophages.

Their use allows the surgeon to perform a ""like with like"" reconstruction by mobilizing surrounding tissues on a consistent vascular source. The authors report their experience with V-Y free-style perforator flaps in reconstruction of soft-tissue defects subsequent to skin cancer excision. METHODS: Forty elective defects in different regions of the body were reconstructed with V-Y advancement local perforator flaps raised in a free-style fashion. There were 23 male patients and 17 female patients. Mean age at surgery was 63 years. All defects resulted from skin cancer ablation. Mean defect size was 5×3.7 cm. Mean flap dimensions were 8.8×4.2 cm. The flaps were based on one (n=10), two (n=18), or three (n=12) perforators. RESULTS: Mean operative time was 93 minutes. Thirty-seven flaps (92.5 percent) healed uneventfully. In three flaps (7.5 percent), moderate venous insufficiency occurred, leading to partial flap necrosis that required surgical revision. In three cases (7.5 percent), the flap was converted to a rotation/hatchet perforator-based peninsular flap. Slight venous stasis was the most common postoperative finding registered (eight flaps; 20 percent). All flaps achieved adequate and durable reconstruction with excellent contour, with a follow-up ranging between 6 months and 2 years. CONCLUSION: Free-style local perforator flaps advanced in V-Y fashion proved to be a valid and reliable solution to restore function and aesthetics of the operated site after skin cancer excision.

We performed MRA and 3D cine phase-contrast (PC) MR imaging with a silicone cerebrovascular phantom of an internal carotid artery-posterior communicating artery aneurysm with blood-mimicking fluid, and controlled flow with a flowmeter. We also obtained RA and CTA data for the phantom. Four analysts constructed vascular models based on the three different modalities. These 12 constructed models used flow information based on 3D cine PC MR imaging for CFD. We compared RA-, CTA-, MRA-based CFD results using the micro-CT-based CFD result as the criterion standard to investigate whether MRA-based CFD was not inferior to RA- or CTA-based CFD. We also analyzed the inter-analyst variability. Wall shear stress (WSS) distributions and streamlines of RA- or MRA-based CFD and those of micro-CT-based CFD were similar, but the vascular models and WSS values were different. Accuracy in measurements of blood vessel diameter, cross-sectional maximum velocity, and spatially averaged WSS was the highest for RA-based CFD, followed by MRA-based and CTA-based CFD using micro-CT-based CFD result as the reference. Except maximum velocity from CTA, all other parameters had good inter-analyst agreement using different modalities.

METHODS: We used a rotating wall vessel bioreactor system to create 3-dimensional (3-D) epithelial cell aggregates to model and assess endocervical infection by M. genitalium. RESULTS: Attachment of M. genitalium to the host cell's apical surface was observed directly and confirmed using immunoelectron microscopy. Bacterial replication was observed from 0 to 72 hours after inoculation, during which time host cells underwent ultrastructural changes, including reduction of microvilli, and marked increases in secretory vesicle formation. Using genome-wide transcriptional profiling, we identified a host defense and inflammation signature activated by M. genitalium during acute infection (48 hours after inoculation) that included cytokine and chemokine activity and secretion of factors for antimicrobial defense. Multiplex bead-based protein assays confirmed secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, several of which are involved in leukocyte recruitment and hypothesized to enhance susceptibility to human immunodeficiency type 1 infection.

rotating_wall,31237973,Anti-Disuse Osteoporosis Activity of a Complex of Calcium-Binding Peptide from Auricularia auricula Protein Hydrolysates.,"Osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease that is often seen in bedridden patients and astronauts. Long-term bed rest and nonweight bearing tend to induce disuse osteoporosis. Calcium supplements are commonly used to help treat disuse osteoporosis along with medications, most of which are calcium carbonate based, but they have poor absorption effects. In this study, we prepared a novel Auricularia auricula peptide-calcium complex (AP-Ca) and evaluated its protective effects on disuse osteoporosis. In vitro assays showed that AP-Ca significantly increased the contents of calcium (P < 0.05) and the activity of alkaline phosphatase (AKP; P < 0.05) of osteoblasts cultured in a two-dimensional-rotating wall vessel. Meanwhile, supplementation with AP-Ca also inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory factors induced by the loss of stress, especially TNF-α (P < 0.05). In vivo, a mouse tail suspension (TS) model was established, and the results showed that AP-Ca helped to improve bone mineral density, bone mineral content, and bone organic content in TS mice and effectively alleviated the alteration of enzymes related to bone metabolism, including AKP (P < 0.05) and serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (P < 0.05), to avoid more serious bone loss induced by TS. Furthermore, we found that AP-Ca downregulated the bone resorption-associated pro-inflammatory genes interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-6 by 59.53 ± 3.55%, 48.01 ± 5.68%, and 40.00 ± 5.89%, respectively (P < 0.05). In conclusion, AP-Ca showed potential to suppress bone loss induced by disuse and might be considered a new alternative to reduce the risk of disuse osteoporosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Highly metastatic MHCC97H cells and a liver tissue fragment were long-term co-cultured in a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor to simulate different pathological states of HCC invasion. The established spherical co-cultures were collected on days 0, 5, 10, and 15 for dynamic expression pattern analysis. Significantly different proteins among spheroids at different time points were screened and identified using quantitative proteomics of iTRAQ labeling coupled with LC-MS/MS. Dynamic expression patterns of differential proteins were further categorized by K-means clustering. The expression modes of several differentially expressed proteins were confirmed by Western blot and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Time course analysis of invasion/metastasis gene expressions (MMP2, MMP7, MMP9, CD44, SPP1, CXCR4, CXCL12, and CDH1) showed remarkable, dynamic alterations during the invasion process of HCC. A total of 1,028 proteins were identified in spherical co-cultures collected at different time points by quantitative proteomics. Among these proteins, 529 common differential proteins related to HCC invasion were clustered into 25 types of expression patterns. Some proteins displayed significant dynamic alterations during the early invasion process of HCC, such as upregulation at the early invasion stage and downregulation at the late invasion stage (e.g., MAPRE1, PHB2, cathepsin D, etc.) or continuous upregulation during the entire invasion process (e.g., vitronectin, Met, clusterin, ICAM1, GSN, etc.). CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic expression patterns of candidate proteins during the early invasion process of HCC facilitate the discovery of new molecular targets for early intervention to prevent HCC invasion and metastasis.",Chen RX; Song HY; Dong YY; Hu C; Zheng QD; Xue TC; Liu XH; Zhang Y; Chen J; Ren ZG; Liu YK; Cui JF,,2014,PloS one,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,28113205,Fully Automatic 3-D-TEE Segmentation for the Planning of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"A novel fully automatic framework for aortic valve (AV) trunk segmentation in three-dimensional (3-D) transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) datasets is proposed. The methodology combines a previously presented semiautomatic segmentation strategy by using shape-based B-spline Explicit Active Surfaces with two novel algorithms to automate the quantification of relevant AV measures. The first combines a fast rotation-invariant 3-D generalized Hough transform with a vessel-like dark tube detector to initialize the segmentation. After segmenting the AV wall, the second algorithm focuses on aligning this surface with the reference ones in order to estimate the short-axis (SAx) planes (at the left ventricular outflow tract, annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, and sinotubular junction) in which to perform the measurements. The framework has been tested in 20 3-D-TEE datasets with both stenotic and nonstenotic AVs. The initialization algorithm presented a median error of around 3 mm for the AV axis endpoints, with an overall feasibility of 90%. In its turn, the SAx detection algorithm showed to be highly reproducible, with indistinguishable results compared with the variability found between the experts' defined planes. Automatically extracted measures at the four levels showed a good agreement with the experts' ones, with limits of agreement similar to the interobserver variability. Moreover, a validation set of 20 additional stenotic AV datasets corroborated the method's applicability and accuracy. The proposed approach mitigates the variability associated with the manual quantification while significantly reducing the required analysis time (12 s versus 5 to 10 min), which shows its appeal for automatic dimensioning of the AV morphology in 3-D-TEE for the planning of transcatheter AV implantation.",Queiros S; Papachristidis A; Morais P; Theodoropoulos KC; Fonseca JC; Monaghan MJ; Vilaca JL; Dhooge J,,2017,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,27486191,Effect of Shear Stress on Pseudomonas aeruginosa Isolated from the Cystic Fibrosis Lung.,"Chronic colonization of the lungs by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. To gain insights into the characteristic biofilm phenotype of P. aeruginosa in the CF lungs, mimicking the CF lung environment is critical. We previously showed that growth of the non-CF-adapted P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain in a rotating wall vessel, a device that simulates the low fluid shear (LS) conditions present in the CF lung, leads to the formation of in-suspension, self-aggregating biofilms. In the present study, we determined the phenotypic and transcriptomic changes associated with the growth of a highly adapted, transmissible P. aeruginosa CF strain in artificial sputum medium under LS conditions. Robust self-aggregating biofilms were observed only under LS conditions. Growth under LS conditions resulted in the upregulation of genes involved in stress response, alginate biosynthesis, denitrification, glycine betaine biosynthesis, glycerol metabolism, and cell shape maintenance, while genes involved in phenazine biosynthesis, type VI secretion, and multidrug efflux were downregulated. In addition, a number of small RNAs appeared to be involved in the response to shear stress. Finally, quorum sensing was found to be slightly but significantly affected by shear stress, resulting in higher production of autoinducer molecules during growth under high fluid shear (HS) conditions. In summary, our study revealed a way to modulate the behavior of a highly adapted P. aeruginosa CF strain by means of introducing shear stress, driving it from a biofilm lifestyle to a more planktonic lifestyle. IMPORTANCE: Biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the hallmarks of chronic cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections. The biofilm matrix protects this bacterium from antibiotics as well as from the immune system. Hence, the prevention or reversion of biofilm formation is believed to have a great impact on treatment of chronic P. aeruginosa CF lung infections. In the present study, we showed that it is possible to modulate the behavior of a highly adapted transmissible P. aeruginosa CF isolate at both the transcriptomic and phenotypic levels by introducing shear stress in a CF-like environment, driving it from a biofilm to a planktonic lifestyle. Consequently, the results obtained in this study are of great importance with regard to therapeutic applications that introduce shear stress in the lungs of CF patients.",Dingemans J; Monsieurs P; Yu SH; Crabbé A; Förstner KU; Malfroot A; Cornelis P; Van Houdt R,,2016,mBio,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,16226120,Three-dimensional growth of extravillous cytotrophoblasts promotes differentiation and invasion.,"Human trophoblast research relies on a combination of in vitro models, including isolated primary cultures, explant cultures, and trophoblast cell lines. In the present study, we have utilized the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor to generate a three-dimensional (3-D) model of human placentation for the study of cytotrophoblast (CTB) invasion. The RWV supported the growth of the human CTB cell line SGHPL-4 and allowed for the formation of complex, multilayered 3-D aggregates that were morphologically, phenotypically, and functionally distinct from SGHPL-4 monolayers. The cells cultured three-dimensionally differentiated into an aggressively invasive cell population characterized by the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-3, MMP-9 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) secretion and activation. Microarray analysis of the 3-D and 2-D cultured cells revealed increased expression in the 3-D cells of various genes that are known mediators of invasion, including MT1-MMP, PECAM-1 and L-selectin, as well as genes not previously associated with CTB differentiation such as MMP-13 and MT5-MMP. These results were verified by quantitative real-time PCR. These findings suggest that when cultured in 3-D, SGHPL-4 cells closely mimic differentiating in utero CTBs, providing a novel approach for the in vitro study of the molecular mechanisms that regulate CTB differentiation and invasion.",LaMarca HL; Ott CM; Höner Zu Bentrup K; Leblanc CL; Pierson DL; Nelson AB; Scandurro AB; Whitley GS; Nickerson CA; Morris CA,,2005,Placenta,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",R03 HD045768/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,15664956,A549 lung epithelial cells grown as three-dimensional aggregates: alternative tissue culture model for Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenesis.,"A three-dimensional (3-D) lung aggregate model was developed from A549 human lung epithelial cells by using a rotating-wall vessel bioreactor to study the interactions between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and lung epithelial cells. The suitability of the 3-D aggregates as an infection model was examined by immunohistochemistry, adherence and invasion assays, scanning electron microscopy, and cytokine and mucoglycoprotein production. Immunohistochemical characterization of the 3-D A549 aggregates showed increased expression of epithelial cell-specific markers and decreased expression of cancer-specific markers compared to their monolayer counterparts. Immunohistochemistry of junctional markers on A549 3-D cells revealed that these cells formed tight junctions and polarity, in contrast to the cells grown as monolayers. Additionally, the 3-D aggregates stained positively for the production of mucoglycoprotein while the monolayers showed no indication of staining. Moreover, mucin-specific antibodies to MUC1 and MUC5A bound with greater affinity to 3-D aggregates than to the monolayers. P. aeruginosa attached to and penetrated A549 monolayers significantly more than the same cells grown as 3-D aggregates. Scanning electron microscopy of A549 cells grown as monolayers and 3-D aggregates infected with P. aeruginosa showed that monolayers detached from the surface of the culture plate postinfection, in contrast to the 3-D aggregates, which remained attached to the microcarrier beads. In response to infection, proinflammatory cytokine levels were elevated for the 3-D A549 aggregates compared to monolayer controls. These findings suggest that A549 lung cells grown as 3-D aggregates may represent a more physiologically relevant model to examine the interactions between P. aeruginosa and the lung epithelium during infection.",Carterson AJ; Höner zu Bentrup K; Ott CM; Clarke MS; Pierson DL; Vanderburg CR; Buchanan KL; Nickerson CA; Schurr MJ,NASA Discipline Cell Biology; Non-NASA Center,2005,Infection and immunity,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",R01 AI050812/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; R01 AI050812-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,11893073,Secondary metabolism in simulated microgravity.,"We have studied microbial secondary metabolism in a simulated microgravity (SMG) environment provided by NASA rotating-wall bioreactors (RWBs). These reactors were designed to simulate some aspects of actual microgravity that occur in space. Growth and product formation were observed in SMG in all cases studied, i.e., Bacillus brevis produced gramicidin S (GS), Streptomyces clavuligerus made beta-lactam antibiotics, Streptomyces hygroscopicus produced rapamycin, and Escherichia coli produced microcin B17 (MccB17). Of these processes, only GS production was unaffected by SMG; production of the other three products was inhibited. This was determined by comparison with performance in an RWB positioned in a different mode to provide a normal gravity (NG) environment. Carbon source repression by glycerol of the GS process, as observed in shaken flasks, was not observed in the RWBs, whether operated in the SMG or NG mode. The same phenomenon occurred in the case of MccB17 production, with respect to glucose repression. Thus, the negative effects of carbon source on GS and beta-lactam formation are presumably dependent on shear, turbulence, and/or vessel geometry, but not on gravity. Stimulatory effects of phosphate and the precursor L-lysine on beta-lactam antibiotic production, as observed in flasks, also occurred in SMG. An almost complete shift in the localization of produced MccB17 from cells to extracellular medium was observed when E. coli was grown in the RWB under SMG or NG. If a plastic bead was placed in the RWB, accumulation became cellular, as it is in shaken flasks, indicating that sheer stress favors a cellular location. In the case of rapamycin, the same type of shift was observed, but it was less dramatic, i.e., growth in the RWB under SMG shifted the distribution of produced rapamycin from 2/3 cellular:1/3 extracellular to 1/3 cellular:2/3 extracellular. Stress has been shown to induce or promote secondary metabolism in a number of other microbial systems. RWBs provide a low stress SMG environment, which, however, supports only poor production of MccB17, as compared to production in shaken flasks. We wondered whether the poor production in RWBs under SMG is due to the low level of stress, and whether increasing stress in the RWBs would raise the amount of MccB17 formed. We found that increasing shear stress by adding a single Teflon bead to the RWB improved MccB17 production. Although shear stress seems to have a marked positive effect on MccB17 production in SMG, addition of various concentrations of ethanol to RWBs (or to shaken flasks) failed to increase MccB17 production. Ethanol stress merely decreased production and, at higher concentrations, inhibited growth. Interestingly, cells growing in the RWB were much more resistant to the growth- and production-inhibitory effects of ethanol than cells growing in shaken flasks. With respect to S. hygroscopicus, addition of Teflon beads to the RWB reversed the inhibition of growth, but rapamycin production was still markedly inhibited, and the distribution did not revert back to a preferential cellular site.",Demain AL; Fang A,NASA Discipline Cell Biology; Non-NASA Center,2001,"Chemical record (New York, N.Y.)","Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,34099760,Human immune system adaptations to simulated microgravity revealed by single-cell mass cytometry.,"Exposure to microgravity (µG) during space flights produces a state of immunosuppression, leading to increased viral shedding, which could interfere with long term missions. However, the cellular mechanisms that underlie the immunosuppressive effects of µG are ill-defined. A deep understanding of human immune adaptations to µG is a necessary first step to design data-driven interventions aimed at preserving astronauts' immune defense during short- and long-term spaceflights. We employed a high-dimensional mass cytometry approach to characterize over 250 cell-specific functional responses in 18 innate and adaptive immune cell subsets exposed to 1G or simulated (s)µG using the Rotating Wall Vessel. A statistically stringent elastic net method produced a multivariate model that accurately stratified immune responses observed in 1G and sµG (p value 2E-4, cross-validation). Aspects of our analysis resonated with prior knowledge of human immune adaptations to µG, including the dampening of Natural Killer, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses. Remarkably, we found that sµG enhanced STAT5 signaling responses of immunosuppressive T(regs). Our results suggest µG exerts a dual effect on the human immune system, simultaneously dampening cytotoxic responses while enhancing T(reg) function. Our study provides a single-cell readout of sµG-induced immune dysfunctions and an analytical framework for future studies of human immune adaptations to human long-term spaceflights.",Spatz JM; Fulford MH; Tsai A; Gaudilliere D; Hedou J; Ganio E; Angst M; Aghaeepour N; Gaudilliere B,,2021,Scientific reports,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",R35 GM137936/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States; R35 GM138353/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,32079291,EMT Transcription Factors Are Involved in the Altered Cell Adhesion under Simulated Microgravity Effect or Overloading by Regulation of E-cadherin.,"In order to study the effect of stress changes on cell adhesion, HUVEC, and MCF-7 cells were treated with simulated microgravity effect (SMG) and overloading (OL). METHODS: Rotating Wall Vessel (2D-RWVS) bioreactor was used to create different culture conditions. In addition, the alteration of cell adhesion states, adhesion proteins, and relating factors of adhesion molecules under these two conditions were detected using cell adhesion assay, immunofluorescence, western blot, and qRT-PCR technology. RESULTS: The results showed that the adhesion of cells decreased under SMG, while increased under OL. The expressions of integrin β1, paxillin, and E-cadherin under SMG condition were down-regulated as compared to that of the control group showing a time-dependent pattern of the decreasing. However, under OL condition, the expressions of adhesion proteins were up-regulated as compared to that of the control group, with a time-dependent pattern of increasing. EMT transcription factors Snail, twist, and ZEB1 were up-regulated under SMG while down-regulated under OL. CONCLUSION: Collectively our results indicated that cells could respond to stress changes to regulate the expressions of adhesion proteins and adapt their adhesion state to the altered mechanical environment. The altered cell adhesion in response to the mechanical stress may involve the changed expression of EMT-inducing factors, Snail, Twist, and ZEB1under the SMG/OL conditions.",Shi S; Li Q; Cao Q; Diao Y; Zhang Y; Yue L; Wei L,HUVEC and MCF-7 cell; cell adhesion; mechanical overloading (OL); simulated microgravity effect (SMG),2020,International journal of molecular sciences,Journal Article,SMFA18K05/Key Laboratory of Space Medicine Fundamentals and Application/,
rotating_wall,24361401,Simulated microgravity increases heavy ion radiation-induced apoptosis in human B lymphoblasts.,"AIMS: Microgravity and radiation, common in space, are the main factors influencing astronauts' health in space flight, but their combined effects on immune cells are extremely limited. Therefore, the effect of simulated microgravity on heavy ion radiation-induced apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive apoptosis signaling were investigated in human B lymphoblast HMy2.CIR cells. MAIN METHODS: Simulated microgravity was achieved using a Rotating Wall Vessel Bioreactor at 37°C for 30 min. Heavy carbon-ion irradiation was carried out at 300 MeV/u, with a linear energy transfer (LET) value of 30 keV/μm and a dose rate of 1Gy/min. Cell survival was evaluated using the Trypan blue exclusion assay. Apoptosis was indicated by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. ROS production was assessed by cytometry with a fluorescent probe dichlorofluorescein. Malondialdehyde was detected using a kit. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and caspase-3 activation were measured by immunoblotting. KEY FINDINGS: Simulated microgravity decreased heavy ion radiation-induced cell survival and increased apoptosis in HMy2.CIR cells. It also amplified heavy ion radiation-elicited intracellular ROS generation, which induced ROS-sensitive ERK/MKP-1/caspase-3 activation in HMy2.CIR cells. The above phenomena could be reversed by the antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and quercetin. SIGNIFICANCE: These results illustrated that simulated microgravity increased heavy ion radiation-induced cell apoptosis, mediated by a ROS-sensitive signal pathway in human B lymphoblasts. Further, the antioxidants NAC and quercetin, especially NAC, might be good candidate drugs for protecting astronauts' and space travelers' health and safety.",Dang B; Yang Y; Zhang E; Li W; Mi X; Meng Y; Yan S; Wang Z; Wei W; Shao C; Xing R; Lin C,Apoptosis; HMy2.CIR cells; Heavy ion radiation; Reactive oxygen species; Simulated microgravity,2014,Life sciences,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,11276435,Recent advances in multivessel coronary grafting without cardiopulmonary bypass.,"BACKGROUND: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) without the heart lung machine has been possible for easily accessible targets such as the anterior descending or proximal right coronary. Until now technical difficulty in reaching lateral and inferior wall targets imposed significant barriers to multivessel off-pump grafting. To expand the potential for off-pump CABG the authors have devised new exposure and stabilization techniques suitable for all target vessels. In this report we relate our experience with these new techniques and demonstrate that multivessel coronary bypass can be safely performed without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS: From February 8, 1993 to December 16, 1997 a total of 280 patients underwent myocardial revascularization on the beating heart via median sternotomy. Until May 20, 1997 only patients with high preoperative risk factors for CPB were considered for this approach (Group A; N = 122). After this date any patients with favorable anatomy were included (Group B; N = 158) and were subsequently compared with patients operated on using CPB during the same time interval (Group C; N = 114). In Group B patients lateral and/or inferior wall targets were exposed by means of 4 cloth slings (2 through the transverse sinus and 2 behind the inferior vena cava) and by positioning the patients in Trendelenburg with rightward rotation of the table. Regional stabilization of the target artery was obtained with a commercial stabilizing foot plate. RESULTS: Thirty day hospital mortality was only 2 patients (1.6%) in Group A, 3 patients (1.9%) in Group B, and 3 patients (2.6%) in Group C (NS). Postoperative complications were low in both Group A and B. When Group B was compared with a similar cohort in whom CPB was used (Group C), there were statistically significant improvements in ICU and hospital stay demonstrated when CPB was not used (16.8+/-10.7 vs 26.3+/-38.6 hours respectively; p = 0.007, and 4.1+/-1.5 vs 5.5+/-2.4 days respectively, p<0.001). Angiographic followup was available for 78 patients in Groups A and B with a global patency rate (all grafts) of 98.6%, including a patency rate of 96.7% for 60 grafts to obtuse marginal branches of the circumflex). CONCLUSIONS: Multivessel CABG without CPB is possible with results similar to those obtained with pump-oxygenator support using simple exposure and stabilization techniques.",Calafiore AM; Di Giammarco G; Teodori G; Mazzei V; Vitolla G,,1998,The heart surgery forum,Clinical Trial; Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,38058780,Interdisciplinary aspects of abdominal and plastic surgery - what does the (abdominal) surgeon need to know?,"INTRODUCTION: The aim was to reflect the established interdisciplinary aspects of general/abdominal and plastic surgery by means of a narrative review. Methods: (i) With specific references out of the medical literature and (ii) own clinical and perioperative as well as operating technical and tactical management experiences obtained in surgical daily practice, we present a choice of options for interdisciplinary cooperation that could be food of thought for other surgeons. CONTENT: - Decubital ulcers require pressure relieve, debridement and plastic surgery coverage, e.g., by a rotation flap plasty, V-Y flap or ""tensor-fascia-lata"" (TFL) flap depending on localization (sacral/gluteal defects, ischiadic tuber). - Coverage of soft tissue defects, e.g., after lymph node dissection, tumor lesions or disturbance of wound healing can be managed with fasciocutaneous or muscle flaps. - Bariatric surgery: Surgical interventions such as butt lift, tummy tuck should be explained and demonstrated in advance and performed commonly after reduction of the body weight. - Abdominoperineal rectum extirpation (APE): Holm's procedure with greater circumferential extent of resection at the mesorectum and the insertion site of the levator muscle at the anal sphicter muscle resulting in a substantial defect is covered by myocutaneous flap plasty. - Hernia surgery: Complicated/recurrent hernias or abdominal wall defect can be covered by flap plasty to achieve functional reconstruction, e.g., using innervated muscle. Thus, abdominal wall can respond better onto changes of pressure and tension. - Necrotising fasciitis: Even in case of suspicious fasciitis, an immediate radical debridement must be performed, followed by intensive care with calculated antibiotic treatment; after appropriate stabilization tissue defects can be covered by mesh graft of flap plasty. - Soft tissue tumor lesions cannot be resected with primary closure to achieve appropriate as intended R0 resection status by means of local radical resection all the time - plastic surgery expertise has to be included into interdisciplinary tumor concepts. - Liposuction/-filling: Liposuction can be used with aesthetic intention after bariatric surgery or for lipedema. Lipofilling is possible for reconstruction and for aesthetic purpose. - Reconstruction of lymphatic vessels: Lymphedema after tumor operations interrupting or blocking lymphatic drainage can be treated with microsurgical reconstructions (such as lympho-venous anastomoses, lympho-lymphatic anastomoses or free microvascular lymph node transfer). - Microsurgery: It is substantial part of modern reconstructive plastic surgery, i.e., surgery of peripheral nerves belongs to this field. For visceral surgery, it can become important for reconstruction of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. - Sternum osteomyelitis: Radical debridement (eventually, complete sternal resection) with conditioning of the wound by vacuum-assisted closure followed by plastic surgery coverage can prevent chronification, threatening mediastinitis, persisting infectious risk, long-term suffering or limited quality of life. SUMMARY: The presented selection of single topics can only be an excerpt of all the options for surgical cooperation in daily clinical and surgical practice. OUTLOOK: An interdisciplinary approach of abdominal and plastic surgery is characterized by a highly developed cooperation in common surgical interventions including various techniques and tactics highlighting the specifics of the two fields.",Kraus A; Damert HG; Meyer F,abdominal surgery; latissimus-dorsi flap; pediculated/free flap transfer; plastic surgery; rectus-abdominis flap,2023,Innovative surgical sciences,Journal Article; Review,,
rotating_wall,29156538,Combined Effects of Simulated Microgravity and Radiation Exposure on Osteoclast Cell Fusion.,"The loss of bone mass and alteration in bone physiology during space flight are one of the major health risks for astronauts. Although the lack of weight bearing in microgravity is considered a risk factor for bone loss and possible osteoporosis, organisms living in space are also exposed to cosmic radiation and other environmental stress factors. As such, it is still unclear as to whether and by how much radiation exposure contributes to bone loss during space travel, and whether the effects of microgravity and radiation exposure are additive or synergistic. Bone is continuously renewed through the resorption of old bone by osteoclast cells and the formation of new bone by osteoblast cells. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of microgravity and radiation by evaluating the maturation of a hematopoietic cell line to mature osteoclasts. RAW 264.7 monocyte/macrophage cells were cultured in rotating wall vessels that simulate microgravity on the ground. Cells under static 1g or simulated microgravity were exposed to γ rays of varying doses, and then cultured in receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) for the formation of osteoclast giant multinucleated cells (GMCs) and for gene expression analysis. Results of the study showed that radiation alone at doses as low as 0.1 Gy may stimulate osteoclast cell fusion as assessed by GMCs and the expression of signature genes such as tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (Trap) and dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (Dcstamp). However, osteoclast cell fusion decreased for doses greater than 0.5 Gy. In comparison to radiation exposure, simulated microgravity induced higher levels of cell fusion, and the effects of these two environmental factors appeared additive. Interestingly, the microgravity effect on osteoclast stimulatory transmembrane protein (Ocstamp) and Dcstamp expressions was significantly higher than the radiation effect, suggesting that radiation may not increase the synthesis of adhesion molecules as much as microgravity.",Shanmugarajan S; Zhang Y; Moreno-Villanueva M; Clanton R; Rohde LH; Ramesh GT; Sibonga JD; Wu H,microgravity; osteoclast; radiation,2017,International journal of molecular sciences,Journal Article,,
rotating_wall,17201921,Yeast genomic expression patterns in response to low-shear modeled microgravity.,"The low-shear microgravity environment, modeled by rotating suspension culture bioreactors called high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs), allows investigation in ground-based studies of the effects of microgravity on eukaryotic cells and provides insights into the impact of space flight on cellular physiology. We have previously demonstrated that low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) causes significant phenotypic changes of a select group of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes associated with the establishment of cell polarity, bipolar budding, and cell separation. However, the mechanisms cells utilize to sense and respond to microgravity and the fundamental gene expression changes that occur are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the global transcriptional response of yeast cells grown under LSMMG conditions using DNA microarray analysis in order to determine if exposure to LSMMG results in changes in gene expression. RESULTS: LSMMG differentially changed the expression of a significant number of genes (1372) when yeast cells were cultured for either five generations or twenty-five generations in HARVs, as compared to cells grown under identical conditions in normal gravity. We identified genes in cell wall integrity signaling pathways containing MAP kinase cascades that may provide clues to novel physiological responses of eukaryotic cells to the external stress of a low-shear modeled microgravity environment. A comparison of the microgravity response to other environmental stress response (ESR) genes showed that 26% of the genes that respond significantly to LSMMG are involved in a general environmental stress response, while 74% of the genes may represent a unique transcriptional response to microgravity. In addition, we found changes in genes involved in budding, cell polarity establishment, and cell separation that validate our hypothesis that phenotypic changes observed in cells grown in microgravity are reflected in genome-wide changes. This study documents a considerable response to yeast cell growth in low-shear modeled microgravity that is evident, at least in part, by changes in gene expression. Notably, we identified genes that are involved in cell signaling pathways that allow cells to detect environmental changes, to respond within the cell, and to change accordingly, as well as genes of unknown function that may have a unique transcriptional response to microgravity. We also uncovered significant changes in the expression of many genes involved in cell polarization and bud formation that correlate well with the phenotypic effects observed in yeast cells when grown under similar conditions. These results are noteworthy as they have implications for human space flight.",Sheehan KB; McInnerney K; Purevdorj-Gage B; Altenburg SD; Hyman LE,,2007,BMC genomics,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,
rotating_wall,27303677,A Three-Dimensional Cell Culture Model To Study Enterovirus Infection of Polarized Intestinal Epithelial Cells.,"Despite serving as the primary entry portal for coxsackievirus B (CVB), little is known about CVB infection of the intestinal epithelium, owing at least in part to the lack of suitable in vivo models and the inability of cultured cells to recapitulate the complexity and structure associated with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Here, we report on the development of a three-dimensional (3-D) organotypic cell culture model of Caco-2 cells to model CVB infection of the gastrointestinal epithelium. We show that Caco-2 cells grown in 3-D using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor recapitulate many of the properties of the intestinal epithelium, including the formation of well-developed tight junctions, apical-basolateral polarity, brush borders, and multicellular complexity. In addition, transcriptome analyses using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) revealed the induction of a number of genes associated with intestinal epithelial differentiation and/or intestinal processes in vivo when Caco-2 cells were cultured in 3-D. Applying this model to CVB infection, we found that although the levels of intracellular virus production were similar in two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D Caco-2 cell cultures, the release of infectious CVB was enhanced in 3-D cultures at early stages of infection. Unlike CVB, the replication of poliovirus (PV) was significantly reduced in 3-D Caco-2 cell cultures. Collectively, our studies show that Caco-2 cells grown in 3-D using the RWV bioreactor provide a cell culture model that structurally and transcriptionally represents key aspects of cells in the human GI tract and can thus be used to expand our understanding of enterovirus-host interactions in intestinal epithelial cells. IMPORTANCE Coxsackievirus B (CVB), a member of the enterovirus family of RNA viruses, is associated with meningitis, pericarditis, diabetes, dilated cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis, among other pathologies. CVB is transmitted via the fecal-oral route and encounters the epithelium lining the gastrointestinal tract early in infection. The lack of suitable in vivo and in vitro models to study CVB infection of the gastrointestinal epithelium has limited our understanding of the events that surround infection of these specialized cells. Here, we report on the development of a three-dimensional (3-D) organotypic cell culture model of human intestinal epithelial cells that better models the gastrointestinal epithelium in vivo. By applying this 3-D model, which recapitulates many aspects of the gastrointestinal epithelium in vivo, to the study of CVB infection, our work provides a new cell system to model the mechanisms by which CVB infects the intestinal epithelium, which may have a profound impact on CVB pathogenesis.

rotating_wall,26030441,The Effect of OSM on MC3T3-E1 Osteoblastic Cells in Simulated Microgravity with Radiation.,"Bone deterioration is a challenge in long-term spaceflight with significant connections to patients experiencing disuse bone loss. Prolonged unloading and radiation exposure, defining characteristics of space travel, have both been associated with changes in inflammatory signaling via IL-6 class cytokines in bone. While there is also evidence for perturbed IL-6 class signaling in spaceflight, there has been scant examination of the connections between microgravity, radiation, and inflammatory stimuli in bone. Our lab and others have shown that the IL-6 class cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) is an important regulator of bone remodeling. We hypothesize that simulated microgravity alters osteoblast OSM signaling, contributing to the decoupling of osteolysis and osteogenesis in bone homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we induced OSM signaling in murine MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cells cultured in modeled microgravity using a rotating wall vessel bioreactor with and without exposure to radiation typical of a solar particle event. We measured effects on inflammatory signaling, osteoblast activity, and mineralization. Results indicated time dependent interactions among all conditions in the regulation of IL-6 production. Furthermore, OSM induced the transcription of OSM receptor ß, IL 6 receptor α subunits, collagen α1(I), osteocalcin, sclerostin, RANKL, and osteoprotegerin. Measurements of osteoid mineralization suggest that the spatial organization of the osteoblast environment is an important consideration in understanding bone formation. Taken together, these results support a role for altered OSM signaling in the mechanism of microgravity-induced bone loss.",Goyden J; Tawara K; Hedeen D; Willey JS; Oxford JT; Jorcyk CL,,2015,PloS one,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",P20GM109095/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States; P20 GM103408/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States; P20 GM109095/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States; R15CA137510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R15 CA137510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; P20GM103408/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,24926614,Early exposure of murine embryonic stem cells to hematopoietic cytokines differentially directs definitive erythropoiesis and cardiomyogenesis in alginate hydrogel three-dimensional cultures.,"HepG2-conditioned medium (CM) facilitates early differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into hematopoietic cells in two-dimensional cultures through formation of embryoid-like colonies (ELCs), bypassing embryoid body (EB) formation. We now demonstrate that three-dimensional (3D) cultures of alginate-encapsulated mESCs cultured in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor can be differentially driven toward definitive erythropoiesis and cardiomyogenesis in the absence of ELC formation. Three groups were evaluated: mESCs in maintenance medium with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, control) and mESCs cultured with HepG2 CM (CM1 and CM2). Control and CM1 groups were cultivated for 8 days in early differentiation medium with murine stem cell factor (mSCF) followed by 10 days in hematopoietic differentiation medium (HDM) containing human erythropoietin, m-interleukin (mIL)-3, and mSCF. CM2 cells were cultured for 18 days in HDM, bypassing early differentiation. In CM1, a fivefold expansion of hematopoietic colonies was observed at day 14, with enhancement of erythroid progenitors, hematopoietic genes (Gata-2 and SCL), erythroid genes (EKLF and β-major globin), and proteins (Gata-1 and β-globin), although ζ-globin was not expressed. In contrast, CM2 primarily produced beating colonies in standard hematopoietic colony assay and expressed early cardiomyogenic markers, anti-sarcomeric α-actinin and Gata-4. In conclusion, a scalable, automatable, integrated, 3D bioprocess for the differentiation of mESC toward definitive erythroblasts has been established. Interestingly, cardiomyogenesis was also directed in a specific protocol with HepG2 CM and hematopoietic cytokines making this platform a useful tool for the study of erythroid and cardiomyogenic development.",Fauzi I; Panoskaltsis N; Mantalaris A,,2014,Stem cells and development,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,
rotating_wall,23053434,Microbial products alter the expression of membrane-associated mucin and antimicrobial peptides in a three-dimensional human endocervical epithelial cell model.,"Our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate tissue-specific mucosal defense can be limited by the lack of appropriate human in vitro models. The endocervix lies between the microbe-rich vaginal cavity and the relatively sterile endometrium and is a major portal of entry for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in women. The endocervix is lined with a simple epithelium, and these cells produce mucus, which plays a key role in immune defense and reproduction. Here we describe the development of a human three-dimensional endocervical epithelial cell model generated by rotating wall vessel bioreactor technology. The model is composed of cellular aggregates that recapitulate major structural and barrier properties essential for the function and protection of the endocervix, including junctional complexes, microvilli, innate immune receptors, antimicrobial peptides, and mucins, the major structural component of mucus. Using this model, we also report, for the first time, that the membrane-associated mucin genes MUC1, MUC4, and MUC16 are differentially regulated in these aggregates by different bacterial and viral products. Differential induction of antimicrobial peptides was also observed with these products. Together these data define unique and flexible innate endocervical immune signatures that follow exposure to microbial products and that likely play a critical role in the outcome of pathogen challenge at this site.",Radtke AL; Quayle AJ; Herbst-Kralovetz MM,,2012,Biology of reproduction,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",R21 AI095859/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; AI095859/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,21169425,Transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to spaceflight conditions involve Hfq regulation and reveal a role for oxygen.,"Assessing bacterial behavior in microgravity is important for risk assessment and prevention of infectious diseases during spaceflight missions. Furthermore, this research field allows the unveiling of novel connections between low-fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the spaceflight-induced global transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that is present in the space habitat. P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq as a global transcriptional regulator. Since Hfq was also differentially regulated in spaceflight-grown Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator acting across bacterial species. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight were the lecA and lecB lectin genes and the gene for rhamnosyltransferase (rhlA), which is involved in rhamnolipid production. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data for this organism grown in microgravity analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Interesting similarities were observed, including, among others, similarities with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen metabolism. While RWV-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight presumably adopted an anaerobic mode of growth, in which denitrification was most prominent. Whether the observed changes in pathogenesis-related gene expression in response to spaceflight culture could lead to an alteration of virulence in P. aeruginosa remains to be determined and will be important for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention, both during spaceflight missions and for the general public.",Crabbé A; Schurr MJ; Monsieurs P; Morici L; Schurr J; Wilson JW; Ott CM; Tsaprailis G; Pierson DL; Stefanyshyn-Piper H; Nickerson CA,,2011,Applied and environmental microbiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",P30 CA023074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; P30 ES006694/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States; ES06694/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States; CA023074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,30478297,Three-dimensional in vitro modeling of malignant bone disease recapitulates experimentally accessible mechanisms of osteoinhibition.,"Malignant bone disease (MBD) occurs when tumors establish in bone, causing catastrophic tissue damage as a result of accelerated bone destruction and inhibition of repair. The resultant so-called osteolytic lesions (OL) take the form of tumor-filled cavities in bone that cause pain, fractures, and associated morbidity. Furthermore, the OL microenvironment can support survival of tumor cells and resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, a deeper understanding of OL formation and MBD progression is imperative for the development of future therapeutic strategies. Herein, we describe a novel in vitro platform to study bone-tumor interactions based on three-dimensional co-culture of osteogenically enhanced human mesenchymal stem cells (OEhMSCs) in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor (RWV) while attached to micro-carrier beads coated with extracellular matrix (ECM) composed of factors found in anabolic bone tissue. Osteoinhibition was recapitulated in this model by co-culturing the OEhMSCs with a bone-tumor cell line (MOSJ-Dkk1) that secretes the canonical Wnt (cWnt) inhibitor Dkk-1, a tumor-borne osteoinhibitory factor widely associated with several forms of MBD, or intact tumor fragments from Dkk-1 positive patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Using the model, we observed that depending on the conditions of growth, tumor cells can biochemically inhibit osteogenesis by disrupting cWnt activity in OEhMSCs, while simultaneously co-engrafting with OEhMSCs, displacing them from the niche, perturbing their activity, and promoting cell death. In the absence of detectable co-engraftment with OEhMSCs, Dkk-1 positive PDX fragments had the capacity to enhance OEhMSC proliferation while inhibiting their osteogenic differentiation. The model described has the capacity to provide new and quantifiable insights into the multiple pathological mechanisms of MBD that are not readily measured using monolayer culture or animal models.",McNeill EP; Reese RW; Tondon A; Clough BH; Pan S; Froese J; Palmer D; Krause U; Loeb DM; Kaunas R; Gregory CA,,2018,Cell death & disease,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",R01 AR066033/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,24709139,Assessing cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and otoprotection in whole organ culture of the mouse inner ear in simulated microgravity.,"Cisplatin is a widely used anti-cancer drug. Ototoxicity is a major dose-limiting side-effect. A reproducible mammalian in-vitro model of cisplatin ototoxicity is required to screen and validate otoprotective drug candidates. We utilized a whole organ culture system of the postnatal mouse inner ear in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor under ""simulated microgravity"" culture conditions. As previously described this system allows whole organ culture of the inner ear and quantitative assessment of ototoxic effects of aminoglycoside induced hair cell loss. Here we demonstrate that this model is also applicable to the assessment of cisplatin induced ototoxicity. In this model cisplatin induced hair cell loss was dose and time dependent. Increasing exposure time of cisplatin led to decreasing EC50 concentrations. Outer hair cells were more susceptible than inner hair cells, and hair cells in the cochlear base were more susceptible than hair cells in the cochlear apex. Initial cisplatin dose determined the final extent of hair cell loss irrespective if the drug was withdrawn or continued. Dose dependant otoprotection was demonstrated by co-administration of the antioxidant agent N-acetyl l-cysteine. The results support the use of this inner ear organ culture system as an in vitro assay and validation platform for inner ear toxicology and the search for otoprotective compounds. reserved.",Tropitzsch A; Arnold H; Bassiouni M; Müller A; Eckhard A; Müller M; Löwenheim H,Cisplatin; Hair cell loss; Organ culture; Organ of Corti; Otoprotection; Ototoxicity,2014,Toxicology letters,Journal Article,,

The co-culture of umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was performed within spinner flasks and a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor using glass-coated styrene copolymer (GCSC) microcarriers. The medium used was composed of serum-free IMDM containing a cocktail of SCF 15 ng·mL(-1), FL 5 ng·mL(-1), TPO 6 ng·mL(-1), IL-3 15 ng·mL(-1), G-CSF 1 ng·mL(-1) and GM-CSF 5 ng·mL(-1). Accessory stromal cells derived from normal allogeneic adipose tissue were encapsulated in alginate-chitosan (AC) beads and used as feeding cells. The quality of the harvested UCB-HSCs and MSCs was assessed by immunophenotype analysis, methylcellulose colony and multi-lineage differentiation assays. After 12 days of culture, the fold-expansion of total cell numbers, colony-forming units (CFU-C), CD34(+)/CD45(+)/CD105(-) (HSCs) cells and CD34(-)/CD45(-)/CD105(+) (MSCs) cells using the RWV bioreactor were (3.7 ± 0.3)- , (5.1 ± 1.2)- , (5.2 ± 0.4)- , and (13.9 ± 1.2)-fold respectively, significantly better than those obtained using spinner flasks. Moreover, UCB-HSCs and UCB-MSCs could be easily separated by gravity sedimentation after the co-culture period as only UCB-MSCs adhered on to the microcarriers. Simultaneously, we found that the fibroblast-like cells growing on the surface of the GCSC microcarriers could be induced and differentiated towards the osteoblastic, chondrocytic and adipocytic lineages. Phenotypically, these cells were very similarly to the MSCs derived from bone marrow positively expressing the MSCs-related markers CD13, CD44, CD73 and CD105, while negatively expressing the HSCs-related markers CD34, CD45 and HLA-DR. It was thus demonstrated that the simultaneous expansion and harvest of UCB-HSCs and UCB-MSCs is possible to be accomplished using a feasible bioreactor culture system such as the RWV bioreactor with the support of GCSC microcarriers.",Kedong S; Xiubo F; Tianqing L; Macedo HM; LiLi J; Meiyun F; Fangxin S; Xuehu M; Zhanfeng C,,2010,Journal of materials science.

rotating_wall,31126713,A case of obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly syndrome complicated with pyometra: tips and tricks for laparoscopic hemihysterectomy.,"OBJECTIVE: To present a case of obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly (OHVIRA) syndrome complicated with pyometra and explain tips and tricks for laparoscopic hemihysterectomy. DESIGN: A step-by-step explanation of the technique with the use of video (Canadian Task Force Classification III). Patient consent and Institutional Review Board approval were obtained. SETTING: OHVIRA syndrome is characterized by the triad of uterovaginal duplication, obstructed hemivagina, and ipsilateral renal agenesis (1). Patients with OHVIRA syndrome usually present with dysmenorrhea and a vaginal or a pelvic mass. Renal, uterine, and vaginal pathologies can be diagnosed with the use of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (2). In cases in which the diagnosis is not delayed, treatment consists of vaginal septostomy (3). Delayed diagnosis may lead to pelvic infections in patients with microperforations in the septum, which may lead to abscess formation, pelvic inflammatory disease, pyometra, and subsequent need for hemihysterectomy and adnexectomy (4). PATIENT(S): A 21-year-old G2 P2 patient who had a history of hospitalization with the diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess three times previously presented to the emergency department with pelvic pain, nausea, high fever, and malodorous vaginal discharge. On physical examination, a pelvic abscess draining to the left vaginal wall and a 10-12-cm left adnexal mass were noticed. A diagnosis of OHVIRA syndrome and pyometra was made after evaluation of ultrasonographic and MRI findings. Longitudinal vaginal septum excision and drainage of the abscess was performed. Ten cubic centimeters of purulent abscess material was drained by incising the left vaginal wall. However, the mass extending from the left vaginal wall to the left adnexal area could not be drained. On hysteroscopy, no cervix was visualized belonging to the obstructed hemivagina and the left uterine cavity could not be entered. On reexamination of the MR images, the presence of a transverse vaginal septum overlying the left hemivagina was detected, preventing access to the left hemiuterine cavity. The transverse vaginal septum could have been excised and the pyometra drained; however, owing to the presence of chronic pelvic pain and dyspareunia, and a history of three failed previous attempts at treatment, the decision to perform hemihysterectomy was made. INTERVENTION(S): A laparoscopic hemihysterectomy was performed in the patient, who was diagnosed as having OHVIRA syndrome complicated with pyometra. Patient consent and Institutional Review Board approval were obtained for this report. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): On laparoscopy, the left hemiuterus on the same side as the obstructed hemivagina appeared three to four times larger than the normal hemiuterus, in which two pregnancies had occurred, and dense adhesions were present between this hemiuterus and the bowel. The left hemiuterus was densely adherent to the pelvic side wall. Laparoscopic hemihysterectomy was performed. A monofilament barbed suture were used for the repair of the paracervical area and left hemivagina. A transverse septum and cervical atresia was noticed at the distal end of the left hemiuterus. The surgical challenges encountered during treatment of this case were the difficulty in recognizing anatomic structures owing to chronic inflammatory changes, dissecting dense adhesions without injuring neighboring pelvic organs, providing adequate hemostasis during dissection of fragile and hemorrhagic tissues, gaining optimal visualization of the surgical field owing to hampered hemostasis, obtaining adequate exposure of the surgical site owing to the inability to use a uterine manipulator, and the difficulty in dissecting the left hemiuterus without damaging the right hemiuterus for fertility preservation. The ultrasonic scalpel is an energy modality that is known to cause the least amount of collateral thermal tissue damage. In the present case, an ultrasonic scalpel was used to dissect dense adhesions between the left hemiuterus and the urinary bladder to minimize the risk of thermal injury to the urinary bladder. The ultrasonic scalpel was also used when dissecting the unhealthy hemiuterus from the healthy hemiuterus owing to its ergonomic tip and to avoid thermal damage to the cervix of the healthy hemiuterus. In areas of dense adhesions and distorted anatomy, the broad tips of bipolar forceps are also helpful for blunt dissection and the creation of tissue planes, and it is also used for effective concomitant hemostasis. A vessel sealer is the most appropriate energy modality for providing effective hemostasis during dissection of the uterine artery while causing minimal collateral tissue damage (5, 6). When deciding the kind of energy modality to be used during operative laparoscopy, the source that minimized thermal injury while providing optimal hemostasis was preferred. Furthermore, additional features such as rotation, dissection, grasping, and the ergonomics of the tip of the device were also considered when choosing the energy source to be used. RESULT(S): The patient was discharged 48 hours postoperatively with no complications. No symptoms of pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia were present at the end of the third month after surgery. CONCLUSION(S): Understanding the exact nature of the uterine anomaly before hemihysterectomy is of paramount importance for a successful surgery. Laparoscopy is a safe and effective treatment modality even in the presence of dense pelvic adhesions and distorted pelvic anatomy. Elsevier Inc.

rotating_wall,25568077,Spaceflight and simulated microgravity cause a significant reduction of key gene expression in early T-cell activation.,"Healthy immune function depends on precise regulation of lymphocyte activation. During the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Apollo and Shuttle eras, multiple spaceflight studies showed depressed lymphocyte activity under microgravity (μg) conditions. Scientists on the ground use two models of simulated μg (sμg): 1) the rotating wall vessel (RWV) and 2) the random positioning machine (RPM), to study the effects of altered gravity on cell function before advancing research to the true μg when spaceflight opportunities become available on the International Space Station (ISS). The objective of this study is to compare the effects of true μg and sμg on the expression of key early T-cell activation genes in mouse splenocytes from spaceflight and ground animals. For the first time, we compared all three conditions of microgravity spaceflight, RPM, and RWV during immune gene activation of Il2, Il2rα, Ifnγ, and Tagap; moreover, we confirm two new early T-cell activation genes, Iigp1 and Slamf1. Gene expression for all samples was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Our results demonstrate significantly increased gene expression in activated ground samples with suppression of mouse immune function in spaceflight, RPM, and RWV samples. These findings indicate that sμg models provide an excellent test bed for scientists to develop baseline studies and augment true μg in spaceflight experiments. Ultimately, sμg and spaceflight studies in lymphocytes may provide insight into novel regulatory pathways, benefiting both future astronauts and those here on earth suffering from immune disorders.",Martinez EM; Yoshida MC; Candelario TL; Hughes-Fulford M,T-cell activation; immunosuppression; spaceflight and microgravity,2015,"American journal of physiology.

rotating_wall,25953900,The Wnt Inhibitor Sclerostin Is Up-regulated by Mechanical Unloading in Osteocytes in Vitro.,"Although bone responds to its mechanical environment, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the response of the skeleton to mechanical unloading are not completely understood. Osteocytes are the most abundant but least understood cells in bones and are thought to be responsible for sensing stresses and strains in bone. Sclerostin, a product of the SOST gene, is produced postnatally primarily by osteocytes and is a negative regulator of bone formation. Recent studies show that SOST is mechanically regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels. During prolonged bed rest and immobilization, circulating sclerostin increases both in humans and in animal models, and its increase is associated with a decrease in parathyroid hormone. To investigate whether SOST/sclerostin up-regulation in mechanical unloading is a cell-autonomous response or a hormonal response to decreased parathyroid hormone levels, we subjected osteocytes to an in vitro unloading environment achieved by the NASA rotating wall vessel system. To perform these studies, we generated a novel osteocytic cell line (Ocy454) that produces high levels of SOST/sclerostin at early time points and in the absence of differentiation factors. Importantly, these osteocytes recapitulated the in vivo response to mechanical unloading with increased expression of SOST (3.4 ± 1.9-fold, p < 0.001), sclerostin (4.7 ± 0.1-fold, p < 0.001), and the receptor activator of nuclear factor κΒ ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) (2.5 ± 0.7-fold, p < 0.001) ratio. These data demonstrate for the first time a cell-autonomous increase in SOST/sclerostin and RANKL/OPG ratio in the setting of unloading. Thus, targeted osteocyte therapies could hold promise as novel osteoporosis and disuse-induced bone loss treatments by directly modulating the mechanosensing cells in bone.",Spatz JM; Wein MN; Gooi JH; Qu Y; Garr JL; Liu S; Barry KJ; Uda Y; Lai F; Dedic C; Balcells-Camps M; Kronenberg HM; Babij P; Pajevic PD,Wnt pathway; bone; cell biology; cell line; cell sorting; mechanical unloading; osteocyte; sclerostin; shear stress,2015,The Journal of biological chemistry,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",DK011794/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States; UH3 AR059655/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States; R01 AR060221/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States; UH2 AR059655/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States; P01 DK011794/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States; AR059655/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States; F32 DK100215/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States,
rotating_wall,14589492,A pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of small intestinal submucosa used to repair spinal ligaments in the goat.,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Destabilization of the lumbar spine results from sacrifice of the anterior longitudinal ligament and disc when removed for graft or cage placement. In a similar fashion, transection of the interspinous ligament during surgical approaches to the posterior spine may result in segmental instability. Such instability can cause abnormal motion or implant migration resulting in a higher incidence of pseudarthrosis. Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a naturally occurring extracellular collagen-based matrix, which is derived from porcine small intestine. SIS contains cytokines and growth factors and has been shown to act as a resorbable scaffold in vivo that promotes host soft tissue regeneration with little scar tissue formation. SIS can be manufactured in laminated sheets of various sizes and thicknesses for different indications. Successful applications of SIS in animals have included dural substitution, rotator cuff repair, vessel repair, abdominal and bladder wall repair, and others. However, SIS has not been investigated to determine its ability to facilitate regeneration of spinal ligaments. PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of SIS as a barrier to prevent interbody device migration, and to act as a scaffold for regeneration of the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) and posterior interspinous ligament (PISL) in a goat model. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: The thoracolumbar spine of the goat was exposed surgically. After resection and removal of the ALL or PISL at alternating levels, either SIS was placed or no treatment was administered. New ligament formation and SIS resorption were monitored over a 12-week period. OUTCOME MEASURES: Plain film radiographs and histomorphometry were used to assess the progress of healing over a 12-week time period. METHODS: Four skeletally mature nubian-alpine crossbred goats were used in this study. Under general anesthesia, each T10 to L5 motion segment was exposed surgically. Both anterolateral and posterior approaches were performed simultaneously at each level. Anteriorly, alternating levels received either 1) anterior discectomy, sacrifice of ALL and placement of SIS (SIS group); 2) anterior discectomy, sacrifice of ALL and no SIS (surgical control group) or 3) no surgical intervention (nonoperative group). A solid interbody spacer was placed into the disc space after discectomy to deter spontaneous anterior interbody fusion. Posteriorly, alternating levels were treated with either 1) sacrifice of the PISL with placement of SIS (SIS group); 2) sacrifice of PISL and no SIS (surgical control group) or 3) no surgical intervention (nonoperative group). The SIS was secured to the adjacent superior and inferior spinous processes to create a tension-band effect. Animals were radiographed immediately postoperatively to confirm placement of interbody spacers and anchors and to serve as a baseline for monitoring interbody spacer positioning. After surgery, all animals were allowed unrestricted motion for 12 weeks. At the end of the 12-week period, animals were radiographed and euthanized. The lumbar spine was harvested en bloc and processed for decalcified histologic evaluation. The dorsal and ventral aspects of each motion segment were analyzed for signs of inflammation and scar tissue formation, residual SIS and regenerated ALL or PISL. RESULTS: All animals tolerated the surgical procedure well, and there were no intraoperative or anesthesia-related complications. Twelve-week radiographs showed some evidence of ventral migration of the interbody spacers in several animals. Fifty percent (two of four) of spacers in surgical control group levels had migrated more than 10 mm (resulting in complete migration out of the disc space), whereas no spacers migrated completely out of levels with SIS placed. Gross analysis at necropsy indicated iatrogenic scar formation at operated levels, the degree of which was not different from surgical control group to SIS levels. Histologic evaluation of areas where the ALL had been removed indicated formation of organized fibrilar collagenous tissue that spanned the disc space at some levels where the SIS was placed. In some cases, the newly formed tissue was approximately the thickness of the ALL at the nonoperative group levels. The newly formed collagenous tissue was accompanied by sparse focal areas of inflammation, with small fragments of residual SIS at some levels. At surgical control group levels, there was a varying degree of connective tissue that ranged from moderately organized to randomly oriented with no significant signs of inflammation. Similarly, histologic analysis of some levels where SIS was placed posteriorly showed formation of organized collagenous tissues where the PISL had been removed. CONCLUSIONS: In this model, the SIS patch was sufficient to prevent acute ventral migration of interbody spacers from the disc space. The extent of long-term healing and new tissue formation in the SIS group indicates that it may be efficacious as a reparative intervention for transected ligaments in the spine. Most SIS specimens showed formation of organized collagenous tissue, indicating a long-term potential for ligament formation. However, in this model, 12 weeks of postoperative healing is insufficient to assess the full potential of SIS as a spinal ligament repair. Further research that follows the healing process to a longer time point postoperatively may be necessary to fully understand the potential of SIS as a resorbable scaffold for tissue replacement.",Ledet EH; Carl AL; DiRisio DJ; Tymeson MP; Andersen LB; Sheehan CE; Kallakury B; Slivka M; Serhan H,,2002,The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,

Early referral of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (ACKD: GFR <or= 30 ml/min: CKD stage 4) is necessary so that they are educated about the different modalities of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) and there is sufficient time to perform a permanent functioning VA before the initiation of HD (Strength of Recommendation C). 2. Preservation of the venous network of the upper extremities (UE): - Venipuntures and catheterizations in the UE should be avoided to reduce the incidence of venous occlusions and stenosis (Strength of Recommendation B). - If venipuncture or catheterization of veins of the UE is necessary, the dorsum of the hand should be the site of choice used and puncture sites should be rotated (Strength of Recommendation C). 3. Preoperative evaluation: Patient evaluation prior to VA placement should include: - A patient history and physical examination directed to evaluation of the existence and quality of the arterial and venous vessels of the UE (Strength of Recommendation B). - When necessary, a complementary examination by Doppler ultrasound (Strength of Recommendation B) or phlebography may be performed. Recommended when there is a history or central venous catheters (CVC) or pacemakers. 4. Timing of VA placement: - A vascular access should be placed starting from a GFR < 20 ml/min (Strength of Recommendation B). - The VA should be placed at least 6 months before the start of HD in the case of native AV fistulae and 3-6 weeks before in the case of synthetic VA (Strength of Recommendation B). SELECTION OF TYPE OF PERMANENT VA AND ITS LOCATION: 1. Type of VA: - A native AV fistula is the VA of choice. When a native AV fistula cannot be established, a synthetic AV graft is the second option (Strength of Recommendation A). - A CVC is the last choice after the previous two options. 2. LOCATION of the VA: In general, the order of preference for the type and location of the VA is: - A wrist (radial-cephalic) primary AV fistula (Strength of Recommendation A). - An elbow (brachial-cephalic) primary AV fistula (Strength of Recommendation B). - A transposed brachial basilic vein fistula (Strength of Recommendation B). - Synthetic or biological grafts; in order of preference, antecubital straight or looped graft, in the arm, and lastly in the chest wall or lower extremity once all options in upper extremities have been discarded (Strength of Recommendation B). CARE OF VA IN PREDIALYSIS: 1. Maturation: - A native AV fistula should not be used in the first month and 6-8 weeks (minimum 4) should be waited before use (Strength of Recommendation C). - A synthetic AV fistula should not be used for puncture for at least 2 weeks after placement and up to 4 weeks may be desirable (Strength of Recommendation C). 2. Prevention of thrombosis: Antiaggregation/Anticoagulation: 1. Systematic use of platelet antiaggregants or anticoagulants in VA to prevent thrombosis or increase their survival has not been established by the evidence and also is associated with a greater risk of bleeding. Their use can be considered in certain situations after careful assessment of the risk-benefit balance (Strength of Recommendation C). CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETERS (CVC): 1. INDICATIONS: They should not be the first option for a permanent VA and should be considered for temporary use only whenever possible. Their main indications are: - Need for urgent HD in patients without permanent VA, patients with a maturing VA or that cannot be cannulated (Strength of Recommendation A). - Inability or difficulty to establish an adequate VA due to either a poor arterial bed or lack of venous development (Strength of Recommendation B). - Hemodialysis for short periods while waiting for a living donor kidney transplant (Strength of Recommendation C). - Patients with special circumstances: very severe comorbidities that imply a life expectancy of less than 1 year, cardiovascular status contraindicating placement of VA, PD patients temporarily on HD, etc. (Strength of Recommendation C). 2. Types of CVC: Selection of the type of catheter should be based on local experience, the patient's individual circumstances and the requirements for its use. - Nontunneled CVC should be reserved for stays < 3 weeks due to their higher rate of complications (Strength of Recommendation B). - Intravascular lengths of 15 cm are recommended in the right jugular vein, 20 cm in the left jugular vein, and 20-25 cm in the femoral veins (Strength of Recommendation B). 3. LOCATION: - The first choice is the right internal jugular vein, followed by the left internal jugular vein, the external jugular vein and the femoral veins. The subclavian veins should only be used exceptionally (Strength of Recommendation A). - Placement of a CVC ipsilateral to a maturing AV fistula should be avoided (Strength of Recommendation B). The use of femoral catheters should be limited to hospitalized (bedridden) patients (Strength of Recommendation B) because they are associated with higher infection and dislodgement rates. - The tip of the CVC should be placed at the entry of the right atrium for nontunneled catheters and within the right atrium for tunneled catheters (Strength of Recommendation B). Placement of CVC in the jugular and subclavian vein should be confirmed radiologically (Strength of Recommendation A). TYPES OF CATHETER AND IMPLANTATION TECHNIQUES: - The implantation team (nephrologist, surgeon, nurse) is more important for results than the technique of implantation used (Strength of Recommendation A). - No catheter has been demonstrated to be superior to others (Strength of Recommendation A). - Surgical, laparoscopic or percutaneous technique show similar results (Strength of Recommendation A). TIMING OF CATHETER IMPLANTATION: - Between catheter insertion and the start of peritoneal dialysis (PD) at least two weeks should be allowed to avoid early leaks (Strength of Recommendation C). - Antibiotic prophylaxis should be performed prior to the implantation procedure (preferably a 1st generation cephalosporin) (Strength of Recommendation A). EARLY COMPLICATIONS AND THEIR TREATMENT: - Prevention of exit site infections: It is mandatory to identify Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriers and treat them with mupirocin ointment either intranasal or pericatheter, or gentamycin pericatheter, to reduce the incidence of infections by this germ (Strength of Recommendation A). - Treatment of exit site infections: Treatment should conform to the PD guidelines published by the SEN. Withdrawal of the catheter due to exit site infection should be considered when there is concurrent peritonitis by the same germ (except coagulase-negative staphylococcus) or treatment-refractory or recurrent infections by the same germ (Strength of Recommendation C). - Mechanical complications: If leakage of peritoneal fluid occurs and dialysis is necessary, the patient should be temporarily transferred to HD or started on automatic peritoneal dialysis (APD) with low volumes and in a decubitus position.",Rodríguez CR; Bardón Otero E; Vila Paz ML,,2008,Nefrologia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola Nefrologia,English Abstract; Journal Article; Practice Guideline,,
