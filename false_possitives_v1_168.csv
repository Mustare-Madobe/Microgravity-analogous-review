2D,15664956,A549 lung epithelial cells grown as three-dimensional aggregates: alternative tissue culture model for Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenesis.,"A three-dimensional (3-D) lung aggregate model was developed from A549 human lung epithelial cells by using a rotating-wall vessel bioreactor to study the interactions between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and lung epithelial cells. The suitability of the 3-D aggregates as an infection model was examined by immunohistochemistry, adherence and invasion assays, scanning electron microscopy, and cytokine and mucoglycoprotein production. Immunohistochemical characterization of the 3-D A549 aggregates showed increased expression of epithelial cell-specific markers and decreased expression of cancer-specific markers compared to their monolayer counterparts. Immunohistochemistry of junctional markers on A549 3-D cells revealed that these cells formed tight junctions and polarity, in contrast to the cells grown as monolayers. Additionally, the 3-D aggregates stained positively for the production of mucoglycoprotein while the monolayers showed no indication of staining. Moreover, mucin-specific antibodies to MUC1 and MUC5A bound with greater affinity to 3-D aggregates than to the monolayers. P. aeruginosa attached to and penetrated A549 monolayers significantly more than the same cells grown as 3-D aggregates. Scanning electron microscopy of A549 cells grown as monolayers and 3-D aggregates infected with P. aeruginosa showed that monolayers detached from the surface of the culture plate postinfection, in contrast to the 3-D aggregates, which remained attached to the microcarrier beads. In response to infection, proinflammatory cytokine levels were elevated for the 3-D A549 aggregates compared to monolayer controls. These findings suggest that A549 lung cells grown as 3-D aggregates may represent a more physiologically relevant model to examine the interactions between P. aeruginosa and the lung epithelium during infection.",Carterson AJ; Höner zu Bentrup K; Ott CM; Clarke MS; Pierson DL; Vanderburg CR; Buchanan KL; Nickerson CA; Schurr MJ,NASA Discipline Cell Biology; Non-NASA Center,2005,Infection and immunity,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",R01 AI050812/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; R01 AI050812-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States
2D,11893073,Secondary metabolism in simulated microgravity.,"We have studied microbial secondary metabolism in a simulated microgravity (SMG) environment provided by NASA rotating-wall bioreactors (RWBs). These reactors were designed to simulate some aspects of actual microgravity that occur in space. Growth and product formation were observed in SMG in all cases studied, i.e., Bacillus brevis produced gramicidin S (GS), Streptomyces clavuligerus made beta-lactam antibiotics, Streptomyces hygroscopicus produced rapamycin, and Escherichia coli produced microcin B17 (MccB17). Of these processes, only GS production was unaffected by SMG; production of the other three products was inhibited. This was determined by comparison with performance in an RWB positioned in a different mode to provide a normal gravity (NG) environment. Carbon source repression by glycerol of the GS process, as observed in shaken flasks, was not observed in the RWBs, whether operated in the SMG or NG mode. The same phenomenon occurred in the case of MccB17 production, with respect to glucose repression. Thus, the negative effects of carbon source on GS and beta-lactam formation are presumably dependent on shear, turbulence, and/or vessel geometry, but not on gravity. Stimulatory effects of phosphate and the precursor L-lysine on beta-lactam antibiotic production, as observed in flasks, also occurred in SMG. An almost complete shift in the localization of produced MccB17 from cells to extracellular medium was observed when E. coli was grown in the RWB under SMG or NG. If a plastic bead was placed in the RWB, accumulation became cellular, as it is in shaken flasks, indicating that sheer stress favors a cellular location. In the case of rapamycin, the same type of shift was observed, but it was less dramatic, i.e., growth in the RWB under SMG shifted the distribution of produced rapamycin from 2/3 cellular:1/3 extracellular to 1/3 cellular:2/3 extracellular. Stress has been shown to induce or promote secondary metabolism in a number of other microbial systems. RWBs provide a low stress SMG environment, which, however, supports only poor production of MccB17, as compared to production in shaken flasks. We wondered whether the poor production in RWBs under SMG is due to the low level of stress, and whether increasing stress in the RWBs would raise the amount of MccB17 formed. We found that increasing shear stress by adding a single Teflon bead to the RWB improved MccB17 production. Although shear stress seems to have a marked positive effect on MccB17 production in SMG, addition of various concentrations of ethanol to RWBs (or to shaken flasks) failed to increase MccB17 production. Ethanol stress merely decreased production and, at higher concentrations, inhibited growth. Interestingly, cells growing in the RWB were much more resistant to the growth- and production-inhibitory effects of ethanol than cells growing in shaken flasks. With respect to S. hygroscopicus, addition of Teflon beads to the RWB reversed the inhibition of growth, but rapamycin production was still markedly inhibited, and the distribution did not revert back to a preferential cellular site.",Demain AL; Fang A,NASA Discipline Cell Biology; Non-NASA Center,2001,"Chemical record (New York, N.Y.)","Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",
2D,20624768,Accuracy of dual-source computed tomography to identify significant coronary artery disease in patients with atrial fibrillation: comparison with coronary angiography.,"AIMS: It has been previously reported that the sensitivity and specificity of multislice computed tomography (CT) for detecting significant coronary artery disease (CAD) is high. However, regular sinus rhythm has been considered a prerequisite for an adequate examination, even though atrial fibrillation (AF) is common among patients evaluated for the presence of coronary heart disease. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity and specificity of dual-source CT (DSCT) to detect and rule out significant coronary stenoses in patients with AF referred for invasive coronary angiography. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and ten consecutive patients with AF who were admitted for a first diagnostic coronary angiogram were screened for participation. Out of these, 50 patients were excluded either due to renal insufficiency, inability to maintain an adequate breath hold or due to rapid AF non-responsive to β-blocker therapy (heart rate > 100 b.p.m.). Sixty remaining patients (mean age 71 ± 7 years) were included and subjected to CT angiography using DSCT within 24 h before invasive coronary angiography. A contrast-enhanced volume data set was acquired (330 ms gantry rotation, collimation 2 × 64 × 0.6 mm, retrospective electrocardiogram gating). Data sets were evaluated concerning the presence or absence of significant coronary stenoses and validated against invasive coronary angiography. A significant stenosis was assumed if the diameter reduction was ≥50%. Mean heart rate during CT was 70 ± 15 b.p.m. (range 32-107 b.p.m.). On a per-patient basis, the sensitivity and specificity for DSCT to detect significant coronary stenoses in vessels >1.5 mm diameter was 100% [14/14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 77-100] and 85% (39/46, 95% CI 71-94), respectively, with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% (39/39, 95% CI 91-100) and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 67% (14/21, 95% CI 43-85). On a per-artery basis, 240 vessels were evaluated (left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary artery in 60 patients, with 3 non-assessable vessels due to either severe calcification or motion artefacts which were considered positive for stenoses) with a sensitivity of 95% (21/22, 95% CI 77-100) and specificity of 94% (204/218, 95% CI 89-97); NPV was 99% (204/205, 95% CI 96-100), and PPV was 60% (21/35, 95% CI 38-80).

2D,19809339,High-pitch electrocardiogram-triggered computed tomography of the chest: initial results.,"OBJECTIVES: Chest pain is one of the most frequent symptoms in the emergency department. A variety of different diseases, some of them acutely life threatening, can be the underlying cause. Electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated computed tomography angiography of the thorax has been proposed as a cost and time effective imaging technique for these patients. We describe a new high-pitch scan mode, which has been developed specifically for low-dose ECG-triggered computed tomography angiography using dual source computed tomography (CT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients were examined with this technique on a second generation dual source CT system. The scan mode uses a pitch of 3.2 to acquire a spiral CT data set of the complete thorax in less than 1 second with a temporal resolution of 75 ms (scan parameters: 128 x 0.6 mm collimation, 0.28 seconds gantry rotation time, 370 mAs at 100 kV [15 patients] and 320 mAs at 120 kV [9 patients], reconstructed slice thickness 0.6 mm, increment 0.4 mm). Data acquisition was prospectively triggered at 50% to 60% of the RR interval to cover the range over the heart in diastole. A triple phase contrast injection protocol (total volume: 80 mL) was used to optimize enhancement of the pulmonary and systemic arterial vessels. Image quality was evaluated using a 4-point scale (1 = absence of motion artifacts; 2 = slight motion artifacts, fully evaluable; 3 = motion artifacts, but evaluable; 4 = unevaluable) on a per-segment basis. RESULTS: The patients had an average heart rate of 68 +/- 15 bpm (range: 43-111 bpm) during data acquisition. Motion artifact free visualization of the aorta and pulmonary vessels was possible in each case, of 344 coronary artery segments, 242 (70%) had an image quality score of 1, 60 segments (17%) a score of 2, 28 segments (8%) a score of 3, and 14 segments (4%) were rated as ""unevaluable."" In 17 patients (10 patients with a heart rate < or =60 bpm) all segments were evaluable. The average dose length product was 113 +/- 11 mGy x cm per scan (mean effective dose 1.6 +/- 0.2 mSv) at 100 kV and 229 +/- 31 mGy x cm per scan (mean effective dose 3.2 +/- 0.4 mSv) at 120 kV. CONCLUSION: Our initial results indicate that this high-pitch scan mode allows motion artifact free and accurate visualization of the thoracic vessels, and diagnostic image quality of the coronary arteries in patients with low and stable heart rates at a very low radiation exposure.",Lell M; Hinkmann F; Anders K; Deak P; Kalender WA; Uder M; Achenbach S,,2009,Investigative radiology,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,16610381,Use of fluoroscopy to evaluate iliac screw position.,"Iliac screw fixation is often used for long fusions to the sacropelvis. Maximum iliac screw purchase is obtained both by placing the screws within 1.5 cm of the greater sciatic notch and by extending them anterior to the axis of rotation in flexion-extension. Screw insertion is ""blinded"" or dependent on tactile feedback, and hence extreme care is necessary to avoid incorrect placement and damage to vital neurovascular structures in the pelvis and sciatic notch. Long screws may violate the hip joint while medial placement may injure the lumbosacral plexus and the nearby vessels. To explore the best intraoperative fluoroscopic method of determining optimal iliac screw placement, we used a synthetic pelvis model to investigate screw placement conditions: (1) optimal anatomic placement, (2) violation of the sciatic notch, (3) hip joint violation, (4) medial wall violation, and (5) lateral wall violation. Each condition was examined utilizing fluoroscopy with posteroanterior, inlet, outlet, lateral, iliac oblique, and obturator oblique Judet views to simulate operative conditions. These views were obtained to evaluate critical malposition of iliac screws. We found that, for a sciatic notch violation, the obturator oblique view best demonstrated the cortical breech, while for a hip joint violation, the inlet and outlet views were best. For a medial wall violation, the iliac oblique view best showed the violation. For a lateral wall violation, we were unable to demonstrate the cortical breech using these fluoroscopic views. Fluoroscopy is an effective method to determine sciatic notch, hip joint, and medial wall violations after iliac screw placement; however, it is not effective in identifying a lateral wall violation.",Orchowski JR; Polly DW Jr; Kuklo TR; Klemme WR; Schroeder TM,,2006,"American journal of orthopedics (Belle Mead, N.J.)","Comparative Study; Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",
2D,29384922,A case report and literature review of sigmoid volvulus in children.,"RATIONALE: Sigmoid volvulus (SV) is an exceptionally rare but potentially life-threatening condition in children. CHIEF COMPLAINT: Abdominal distention for 1 week. DIAGNOSES: Sigmoid volvulus. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present a case of a 12-year-old boy with mechanical ileus who was finally confirmed to have SV with the combination of abdominal plain film, sonography, and computed tomography (CT) with the finding of mesenteric artery rotation. INTERVENTIONS: Because bowel obstruction was suspected, abdominal plain film, sonography, and CT were performed. The abdominal CT demonstrated whirlpool sign with torsion of the sigmoid vessels. In addition, lower gastrointestinal filling study showed that the contrast medium could only reach the upper descending colon. Therefore, he received laparotomy with mesosigmoidoplasty for detorsion of the sigmoid. OUTCOMES: The postoperative recovery was smooth under empirical antibiotic treatment with cefazolin. A follow-up lower gastrointestinal series on the seventh day of admission showed no obstruction compared with the previous series. He was finally discharged in a stable condition 8 days after admission. LESSONS: SV is a congenital anomaly and an uncommon diagnosis in children. Nevertheless, case series and case reports of SV are becoming more prevalent in the literature. Failure to recognize SV may result in life-threatening complications such as sigmoid gangrene/perforation, peritonitis, sepsis, and death. Thus, if the children have persistent and recurrent abdominal distention, abdominal pain, and vomiting, physicians should consider SV as a ""do not miss diagnosis"" in the differential diagnosis. reserved.",Chang PH; Jeng CM; Chen DF; Lin LH,,2017,Medicine,Case Reports; Journal Article; Review,
2D,22794707,Radical tumor excision and immediate abdominal wall reconstruction in patients with aggressive neoplasm compromised full-thickness lower abdominal wall.,"BACKGROUND: Radical tumor resection and immediate lower abdominal wall reconstruction in patients with aggressive neoplasm invading full-thickness abdominal wall are challenging because of their close proximity and possible invasion to bone and great vessels, as well as consequent giant defect. METHODS: Data on 16 patients were reviewed retrospectively. Radical neoplasm resection and immediate abdominal wall reconstruction using the combined technique of intraperitoneal mesh placement, sublay technique, pedicled great omentum flap, and rotation skin graft were performed. RESULTS: Sixteen patients underwent radical abdominal wall neoplasm resection, achieving clear margin of >3 cm. The mean size of consequent giant defect was 226.5 ± 65.5 cm(2), with a mean polypropylene mesh size of 160.7 ± 40.5 cm(2) and a mean compound mesh size of 330.8 ± 100.2 cm(2). Sixteen patients had a mean follow-up duration of 32.5 ± 12.5 months. Four patients developed incisional infections, and 1 patient died of several metastatic lesions 24 months postoperatively. No ventral hernia and abdominal wall recurrence were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Radical neoplasm resection and immediate abdominal wall reconstruction are appropriate for patients with aggressive neoplasm in the lower abdominal wall.",Yang F,,2013,American journal of surgery,Journal Article,
2D,35288561,Microfluidic manipulation by spiral hollow-fibre actuators.,"A microfluidic manipulation system that can sense a liquid and control its flow is highly desirable. However, conventional sensors and motors have difficulty fitting the limited space in microfluidic devices; moreover, fast sensing and actuation are required because of the fast liquid flow in the hollow fibre. In this study, fast torsional and tensile actuators were developed using hollow fibres employing spiral nonlinear stress, which can sense the fluid temperature and sort the fluid into the desired vessels. The fluid-driven actuation exhibited a highly increased response speed (27 times as fast as that of air-driven actuation) and increased power density (90 times that of an air-driven solid fibre actuator). A 0.5 K fluid temperature fluctuation produced a 20° rotation of the hollow fibre. These high performances originated from increments in both heat transfer and the average bias angle, which was understood through theoretical analysis. This work provides a new design strategy for intelligent microfluidics and inspiration for soft robots and smart devices for biological, optical, or magnetic applications.",Li S; Zhang R; Zhang G; Shuai L; Chang W; Hu X; Zou M; Zhou X; An B; Qian D; Liu Z,,2022,Nature communications,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",
2D,34232872,Development of an Integrated C-Arm Interventional Imaging System With a Strip Photon Counting Detector and a Flat Panel Detector.,"Modern interventional x-ray systems are often equipped with flat-panel detector-based cone-beam CT (FPD-CBCT) to provide tomographic, volumetric, and high spatial resolution imaging of interventional devices, iodinated vessels, and other objects. The purpose of this work was to bring an interchangeable strip photon-counting detector (PCD) to C-arm systems to supplement (instead of retiring) the existing FPD-CBCT with a high quality, spectral, and affordable PCD-CT imaging option. With minimal modification to the existing C-arm, a 51×0.6 cm(2) PCD with a 0.75 mm CdTe layer, two energy thresholds, and 0.1 mm pixels was integrated with a Siemens Artis Zee interventional imaging system. The PCD can be translated in and out of the field-of-view to allow the system to switch between FPD and PCD-CT imaging modes. A dedicated phantom and a new algorithm were developed to calibrate the projection geometry of the narrow-beam PCD-CT system and correct the gantry wobbling-induced geometric distortion artifacts. In addition, a detector response calibration procedure was performed for each PCD pixel using materials with known radiological pathlengths to address concentric artifacts in PCD-CT images. Both phantom and human cadaver experiments were performed at a high gantry rotation speed and clinically relevant radiation dose level to evaluate the spectral and non-spectral imaging performance of the prototype system. Results show that the PCD-CT system has excellent image quality with negligible artifacts after the proposed corrections. Compared with FPD-CBCT images acquired at the same dose level, PCD-CT images demonstrated a 53% reduction in noise variance and additional quantitative imaging capability.",Ji X; Feng M; Treb K; Zhang R; Schafer S; Li K,,2021,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,Journal Article,
2D,21938601,[Knee disarticulation and through-knee amputation].,"OBJECTIVE: A knee disarticulation or a through-knee stump is superior compared to a transfemoral stump. The thigh muscles are all preserved, and the muscle balance remains undisturbed. The range of motion of the hip joint is not limited. The bulbous shape of the stump allows full weight bearing at the stump end and can easily be fitted with a prosthesis. An amputee with a bilateral knee disarticulation is able to walk ""barefoot"". INDICATIONS: A more distal amputation level, e.g., an ultra-short transtibial amputation, is not possible. Important alternative to transfemoral amputations. Possible for any etiology except for Buerger-Winiwarter's disease. New indications are infected and loosened total knee replacements. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Preservation of the knee joint is possible. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Knee disarticulation is a very atraumatic procedure, compared to transfemoral amputations. Neither bones nor muscles have to be severed, just skin, ligaments, vessels, and nerves. Even the meniscal cartilages may be left in place to act as axial shock absorbers. The cartilage of the femur is not resected, but only bevelled in case of osteoarthritis. There are no tendon attachments or myoplastic procedures necessary. The patella remains in place and is held in position only by the retinacula. Skin closure must be performed without the slightest tension, and if possible not in the weight-bearing area. Transcondylar amputations across the femoral condyles only are indicated when there are not sufficient soft tissues for wound closure of a knee disarticulation. Alternatives as the techniques of Gritti, Klaes, and Eigler, the shortening of the femur and the Sauerbruch's rotation plasty [14] are presented and discussed. POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT: The risk of decubital ulcers is rather high. Correct bandaging of the stump is, therefore, particularly important. Prosthetic fitting is possible 3-6 weeks after surgery. The type of prosthesis depends on the amputee's activity level. RESULTS: The superior performance of amputees with knee disarticulations in sports prove the superiority of that amputation level compared to transfemoral amputees. However, because less than 5% of amputations are knee disarticulations, statements about statistical significance cannot be made. On the other hand, one should do everything to preserve an ultra-short transtibial stump.",Baumgartner R,,2011,Operative Orthopadie und Traumatologie,English Abstract; Journal Article,

We describe a simplified method for intubation and demonstrate its applicability for single-breath-hold micro-CT in mice. METHODS: Mice (n = 10) were anesthetized, intubated, ventilated, and relaxed by intraperitoneal administration of rocuronium. Contrast-enhanced micro-CT of the complete thorax including the upper abdominal organs (80 kV; 37.5 μA; 190-degree rotation; 600 projections/20 seconds or 1200 projections/40 seconds; 39 × 39 × 50-μm voxel size) was performed with and without single-breath-hold technique. RESULTS: The simplified method of intubation was fast (<1 minute) and required no special hardware in all mice. Relaxation of mice allowed prolonged single-breath-hold imaging of up to 40 seconds. Diameter of smallest identifiable lung vessels was 100 μm. CONCLUSIONS: The presented simplified method for intubation in mice is fast, safe, and effective. Additional relaxation allowed high-resolution single-breath-hold micro-CT in mice.",Boll H; Bag S; Schambach SJ; Doyon F; Nittka S; Kramer M; Groden C; Brockmann MA,,2010,Journal of computer assisted tomography,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,32728537,Ideal Flap Cover for the Salvage of Exposed/Infected Cochlear Implants: A Case Series and Literature Review.,"With an increase in the number of cochlear implant surgeries there is bound to be an increase in the number of complications. A dreaded problem in any implant procedure is the implant exposure and infection. Explantation of the implant leads to an unpleasant situation to the patient and the surgeon owing to the high cost of the device. There are reports in the literature favouring the mandatory relocation or removal of the infected implants. On the other hand, there are convincing reports of implant salvage using skin, muscle or fascial flaps. In this paper we have analysed a series of cases referred to us from the departments of E.N.T for the management of implant exposure/infection. We have also reviewed similar case series reported in the literature. From 2014 to 2017 we operated six cases of exposed cochlear implant. We salvaged the implant in five cases, where we could do two layer coverage consisting of the inner temporoparietal fascial flap and outer scalp skin flap. In one case where the temporoparietal fascial flap could not be done as superficial temporal vessels were found to be injured in the previous surgery, the implant was removed due to persistent infection. All these cases were administered appropriate antibiotics for a minimum period of 3 weeks. Early double layer closure with inner temporoparietal fascial flap and outer scalp rotation flap coupled with appropriate antibiotics can salvage an infected, exposed implant.",Hariharan NC; Muthukumar R; Sridhar R; Shankari B; Valarmathy VS,Cochlear implant salvage; Exposed cochlear implant; Infected cochlear implant; Temporoparietal fascial flap,2020,Indian journal of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery : official publication,Journal Article,
2D,25642101,The freestyle pedicle perforator flap: a new favorite for the reconstruction of moderate-sized defects of the torso and extremities.,"BACKGROUND: Perforating vessels are a consistent anatomical finding and well described in the current literature. Any skin flap can be raised on a subcutaneous pedicle as long as it contains at least one supplying perforator. Perforator flaps have been interlinked with microsurgery and generally not widely performed by the general plastic surgeons. The aim of this paper is to present the simplicity of pedicled perforator flap reconstruction of moderate-sized defects of the extremities and torso. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 34 patients reconstructed using 34 freestyle pedicled perforator flaps for moderate-sized defects of the truncus and extremities. We registered indications, flap size and localization, success rate, and complications. Most importantly, we describe a simple approach to the design of freestyle pedicled perforator flaps and elaborate on technical aspects in the context of current literature. RESULTS: The reconstructive goals were achieved in all cases without any total flap loss or major complications. Minor complications occurred in 7/34 (21 %) cases consisting of venous congestion leading to distal tip necrosis or epidermolysis; partial flap loss was significant in 4 cases, however never more than 10 % of the total flap size. Reconstruction was performed on the lower limb in 13 cases, upper limb in 12, and 9 cases were on the truncus. The angle of rotation was 90° in 21 cases and 180° in 13 cases. The most common indication was reconstruction of oncological skin defects; melanoma 19, BCC 6, SCC 2, other 7. The flap size varied from 1.5×3 cm to 12×22 cm. The perforator identification was done by intraoperative exploration in 17 cases and by color Doppler ultrasonography in 17 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-sized defects of the torso and extremities can be successfully reconstructed by pedicled perforator flaps. The flap dissection is simple, and the complication rates comparable to other reconstructive options.

2D,38460827,Three-dimensional volume rendering ultrasound for assessing placenta accreta spectrum severity and discriminating it from simple scar dehiscence.,"BACKGROUND: Prenatal ultrasound discrimination between placenta accreta spectrum and scar dehiscence with underlying nonadherent placenta is challenging both prenatally and intraoperatively, which often leads to overtreatment. In addition, accurate prenatal prediction of surgical difficulty and morbidity in placenta accreta spectrum is difficult, which precludes appropriate multidisciplinary planning. The advent of advanced 3-dimensional volume rendering and contrast enhancement techniques in modern ultrasound systems provides a comprehensive prenatal assessment, revealing details that are not discernible in traditional 2-dimensional imaging. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the use of 3-dimensional volume rendering ultrasound techniques in determining the severity of placenta accreta spectrum and distinguishing between placenta accreta spectrum and scar dehiscence with underlying nonadherent placenta. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, cohort study was conducted between July 2022 and July 2023 in the fetal medicine unit of Dr Soetomo Academic General Hospital, Surabaya, Indonesia. All pregnant individuals with anterior low-lying placenta or placenta previa with a previous caesarean section who were referred with suspicion of placenta accreta spectrum were consented and screened using the standardised 2-dimensional and Doppler ultrasound imaging. Additional 3-dimensional volumes were obtained from the sagittal section of the uterus with a filled urinary bladder. These were analyzed by rotating the region of interest to be perpendicular to the uterovesical interface. The primary outcomes were the clinical and histologic severity in the cases of placenta accreta spectrum and correct diagnosis of dehiscence with nonadherent placenta underneath. The strength of association between ultrasound and clinical outcomes was determined. Multivariate logistic regression analyses and diagnostic testing of accuracy were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients (56 with placenta accreta spectrum and 14 with scar dehiscence) were included in the analysis. Multivariate logistic regression of all 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional signs revealed the 3-dimensional loss of clear zone (P<.001) and the presence of bridging vessels on 2-dimensional Doppler ultrasound (P=.027) as excellent predictors in differentiating scar dehiscence and placenta accreta spectrum. The 3-dimensional loss of clear zone demonstrated a high diagnostic accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.911 (95% confidence interval, 0.819-1.002), with a sensitivity of 89.3% (95% confidence interval, 78.1-95.97%) and specificity of 92.9% (95% confidence interval, 66.1-99.8%). The presence of bridging vessels on 2-dimensional Doppler demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.848 (95% confidence interval, 0.714-0.982) with a sensitivity of 91.1% (95% confidence interval, 80.4-97.0%) and specificity of 78.6% (95% confidence interval, 49.2-95.3%). A subgroup analysis among the placenta accreta spectrum group revealed that the presence of a 3-dimensional disrupted bladder serosa with obliteration of the vesicouterine space was associated with vesicouterine adherence (P<.001). CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional volume rendering ultrasound is a promising tool for effective discrimination between scar dehiscence with underlying nonadherent placenta and placenta accreta spectrum. It also shows potential in predicting the clinical severity with urinary bladder involvement in cases of placenta accreta spectrum.",Adu-Bredu TK; Ridwan R; Aditiawarman A; Ariani G; Collins SL; Aryananda RA,3D ultrasound; PAS disorders; bladder injury; cesarean hysterectomy; crystal vue; placenta accreta; placenta previa; silhouette; tramline sign,2024,American journal of obstetrics & gynecology MFM,Journal Article,
2D,17296999,Dynamic 3D-CT angiography.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: 3D-CT angiography (3D-CTA), a vessel-cast technique, is useful in the diagnosis of patients with brain lesions and cerebrovascular disease. However, it provides no information on blood-flow dynamics. Therefore, we developed a new technique, dynamic 3D-CTA (d3D-CTA), that yields 3D images of the vasculature and allows assessment of the hemodynamics and of the cerebral perfusion. METHODS: We subjected 12 patients to d3D-CTA; 7 had brain tumors, 4 had arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and 1 presented with cervical internal carotid artery occlusion. d3D-CTA was performed with a multidetector-row CT scanner with 64 detectors; the parameters were 0.5-mm section thickness, 0.5 seconds per rotation, 135 kV, and 150 mA. Contrast medium (total volume, 30-35 mL) was injected at 6-7 mL/s; scanning was started after a 5-second delay. Scans were generated with volume-rendering reconstruction and displayed in cine mode. RESULTS: We succeeded in obtaining d3D-CTA scans in all cases. The scans yielded 3D information on the vascular structures and hemodynamics and on the status of the cerebral perfusion. CONCLUSION: d3D-CTA facilitates the acquisition of information on the vascular and cerebral dynamic blood flow on 3D-CTA images. Despite the relatively high radiation exposure and contrast injection speed and its limited scan range, this technique is useful for the diagnosis of patients with brain tumors or cerebrovascular disease and for treatment planning.",Matsumoto M; Kodama N; Endo Y; Sakuma J; Suzuki K; Sasaki T; Murakami K; Suzuki K; Katakura T; Shishido F,,2007,AJNR.

This study was designed to determine the value of a 64-slice-MDCT scanner in comparison to invasive coronary angiography for the detection of CAD in a population of symptomatic patients. Fifty-one patients with suspected CAD underwent conventional coronary angiography and ECG-gated cardiac 64-slice-MDCT angiography with a rotation time of 330 ms, a collimation of 64x0.6 mm and a slice thickness of 0.75 mm. Blinded patient- and segment-based analysis was performed for the detection of stenoses >or=70% of the vessel lumen. 95% of all coronary segments were assessable by MDCT angiography. Patient-based (segment-based) analysis revealed a sensitivity of 97.8% (86.7%), specificity of 50% (95.2%), positive predictive value of 93.6% (75.2%) and negative predictive value of 75% (97.7%). Inter-rater agreement revealed a kappa-value of 0.558 (0.722). In this symptomatic patient group a 64-slice-MDCT scanner shows good agreement on a segment-based analysis but only moderate agreement on a patient-based analysis. The diagnostic accuracy of 64-slice-MDCT coronary angiography is negatively influenced by the high pre-test probability of this symptomatic patient collective.",Mühlenbruch G; Seyfarth T; Soo CS; Pregalathan N; Mahnken AH,,2007,European radiology,Comparative Study; Evaluation Study; Journal Article,
2D,16019087,Noninvasive assessment of coronary stents in patients by 16-slice computed tomography.,"BACKGROUND: The usefulness of thin-slice multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) has been highly expected to assess the lumens of coronary artery stents. We evaluated the usefulness of 16-slice MDCT to assess the in-stent lumen after coronary artery stenting. METHODS: In 42 consecutive patients after coronary artery stenting, retrospective ECG-gated CT-angiography using 16-slice MDCT (0.5-s rotation time, 16x0.625-mm detector collimation) was performed. The qualitative assessability of the lumens of 61 coronary stents (14 different types) by MDCT and the reasons for non-assessability were investigated. Furthermore, the evaluation of in-stent restenosis in 21 assessable stents of 16 patients, including quantitative density analysis by MDCT, was performed and the results were compared with those of conventional coronary angiography (CAG). RESULTS: Of 61 stents, 42 (68.9%) were assessable. The assessability of diameter > or =3.5-mm stents made of stainless steel or cobalt was high (88.6%, 31/35), that of 3.0-mm stents was low (57.9%, 11/19) and all 2.5-mm stents were non-assessable due to partial volume effects and metal artifacts of stents. The lumens of stents made of tantalum were totally obscured and the metal artifacts of Bestent2 (gold markers) and S670 were severer than others. All non-assessable stents due to banding artifact and calcification were implanted in segment #1-3 and #6, respectively. In comparison to CAG, MDCT correctly detected the 5 in-stent restenoses and identified absence of restenoses was influenced strongly by the stent strut. CONCLUSION: Despite some limitations, 16-slice MSCT is sufficiently useful for assessment of various coronary stents in patients and can detect in-stent restenoses of assessable stents with high accuracy in comparison to CAG.",Kitagawa T; Fujii T; Tomohiro Y; Maeda K; Kobayashi M; Kunita E; Sekiguchi Y,,2006,International journal of cardiology,Comparative Study; Evaluation Study; Journal Article,
2D,35731511,Characteristics of the Optic Nerve Head in Myopic Eyes Using Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the characteristics of the optic nerve head (ONH) in myopia using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). METHODS: Participants were divided into three groups according to the axial length (AL). The optic disc morphology, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, and radial peripapillary capillary (RPC) vessel density (VD), optic disc tilt, rotation, Bruch's membrane opening distance (BMOD), border length (BL), border tissue angle, focal lamina cribrosa (LC) defects, β- and γ-zone peripapillary atrophy (PPA), microvasculature dropout (MvD), choroidal thickness (CT), and the choroidal vascularity index (CVI) were compared. Linear regression analysis evaluated relationships between spherical equivalent, AL, and ONH parameters. RESULTS: One hundred five, 98, and 118 eyes were included in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. With AL increasing, the mean, superior and temporal CT, central mean and temporal, pericentral mean, inferior and nasal RPC VD, and temporal CVI decreased, whereas the mean and temporal RNFL thickness, optic disc, RIM and β-PPA area, presence and area of γ-PPA, BMOD and BL increased. Compared to other groups, group 3 depicted a larger cup area, more focal LC defect and total and juxtapapillary MvD; a lower central superior, inferior and nasal, pericentral superior, and temporal RPC VD. Group 1 demonstrated more tilted disc, larger inferior and nasal CT, mean, superior, inferior, and nasal CVI. CONCLUSIONS: Myopia eyes have larger ONH changes, PPAs, regional RNFL, and MvD, but smaller regional CTs, RPC VD, and CVIs. SS-OCT may be useful in detecting ONH variations during myopia.",Cheng D; Ruan K; Wu M; Qiao Y; Gao W; Lian H; Shen M; Bao F; Yang Y; Zhu J; Huang H; Meng X; Shen L; Ye Y,,2022,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,35307869,New trend: Surgical correction of Ebstein's anomaly using modified cone repair and a combination of different techniques.,"BACKGROUND: Ebstein's anomaly,a rare cardiac disease that accounts for <1% of all congenital heart diseases, is a right ventricular myopathy with varying degrees of delamination in the endocardium under the tricuspid valve. Cone reconstruction, first described by da Silva in 2004, is a modification of the Carpentier technique. An alternative surgical treatment for Ebstein's anomaly, it is now the preferred surgical corrective technique. AIMS: This study demonstrates that our modifications of the cone repair procedure to correct Ebstein's anomaly improve valve coaptation and stabilization in the early and midterm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 134 patients diagnosed with Ebstein's anomaly in our clinic between January 2012 and October 2020, 10 underwent a cone procedure and its modifications and were thus included in the study. The mean age of these patients was 28.6 ± 18.79 years and ranged from 1 to 61 years. Thirty percent of the patients were male and 70% were female. RESULTS: The additional procedures performed were an isolated cone procedure (two patients), anomalous pulmonary venous return repair in addition to a cone procedure (one patient), single-vessel coronary artery bypass (one patient), Glenn procedure (two patients), and tricuspid ring annuloplasty (four patients). CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, which assesses the outcomes of patients who underwent cone repairs with surgical modifications, we argue that right ventricular oblique plication, tricuspid valve delamination, surgical valve rotation, and tricuspid ring annuloplasty protect valve coaptation and function in the early and midterm, thereby having beneficial effects on right ventricle remodeling.",Çine N; Kara KA,Ebstein's anomaly; cone repair; oblique plication of right ventricle; tricuspid ring-annuloplasty,2022,Journal of cardiac surgery,Journal Article,
2D,17089831,Towards a theory of a solution space for the biplane imaging geometry problem.,"Biplane angiographic imaging is a primary method for visual and quantitative assessment of the vasculature. In order to reliably reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) position, orientation, and shape of the vessel structure, a key problem is to determine the rotation matrix R and the translation vector t which relate the two coordinate systems. This so-called Imaging Geometry Determination problem is well studied in the medical imaging and computer vision communities and a number of interesting approaches have been reported. Each such technique determines a solution which yields 3D vasculature reconstructions with errors comparable to other techniques. From the literature, we see that different techniques with different optimization strategies yield reconstructions with equivalent errors. We have investigated this behavior, and it appears that the error in the input data leads to this equivalence effectively yielding what we call the solution space of feasible geometries, i.e., geometries which could be solutions given the error or uncertainty in the input image data. In this paper, we lay the theoretical framework for this concept of a solution space of feasible geometries using simple schematic constructions, deriving the underlying mathematical relationships, presenting implementation details, and discussing implications and applications of the proposed idea. Because the solution space of feasible geometries encompasses equivalent solutions given the input error, the solution space approach can be used to evaluate the precision of calculated geometries or 3D data based on known or estimated uncertainties in the input image data. We also use the solution space approach to calculate an imaging geometry, i.e., a solution.",Singh V; Xu J; Hoffmann KR; Xu G; Chen Z; Gopal A,,2006,Medical physics,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",HL 52567/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States
2D,23417958,3D quantitative analyses of angiogenic sprout growth dynamics.,"BACKGROUND: Zebrafish intersegmental vessel (ISV) growth is widely used to study angiogenesis and to screen drugs and toxins that perturb angiogenesis. Most current ISV growth assays observe the presence or absence of ISVs or perturbation of ISV morphology but do not measure growth dynamics. We have developed a four-dimensional (4D, space plus time) quantitative analysis of angiogenic sprout growth dynamics for characterization of both normal and perturbed growth. RESULTS: We tracked the positions of the ISV base and tip for each ISV sprout in 4D. Despite immobilization, zebrafish embryos translocated globally and non-uniformly during development. We used displacement of the ISV base and the angle between the ISV and the dorsal aorta to correct for displacement and rotation during development. From corrected tip cell coordinates, we computed average ISV trajectories. We fitted a quadratic curve to the average ISV trajectories to produce a canonical ISV trajectory for each experimental group, arsenic treated and untreated. From the canonical ISV trajectories, we computed curvature, average directed migration speed and directionality. Canonical trajectories from treated (arsenic exposed) and untreated groups differed in curvature, average directed migration speed and angle between the ISV and dorsal aorta. CONCLUSIONS: 4D analysis of angiogenic sprout growth dynamics: (1) Allows quantitative assessment of ISV growth dynamics and perturbation, and (2) provides critical inputs for computational models of angiogenesis.",Shirinifard A; McCollum CW; Bolin MB; Gustafsson JÅ; Glazier JA; Clendenon SG,,2013,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,20817435,In vitro evaluation of 56 coronary artery stents by 256-slice multi-detector coronary CT.,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate stent lumen visibility of 56 coronary stents with the newest 256-multi-slice-CT (256-MDCT) technology for different reconstruction algorithms in an in vitro model. BACKGROUND: Early identification of in-stent restenosis (ISR) is important to avoid recurrent ischemia and prevent acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Since angiography has the disadvantage of high costs and its invasiveness, MDCT could be a convenient and safe non-invasive alternative for detection of ISR. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Percentages of in-stent lumen diameter and in-stent signal attenuation (measured as contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)) of 56 coronary stents (group A ≤2.5mm; group B=2.75-3.0mm; group C=3.5-4.0mm) were evaluated in a coronary vessel in vitro phantom (iodine-filled plastic tubes) employing four different reconstruction algorithms (XCD, CC, CD, XCB) on a novel 256-MDCT (Philips-iCT, collimation=128 mm × 0.625 mm; rotation time=270 ms; tube current=800 mAs with 120 kV). Analysis was conducted with the semi-automatical full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) method. P-values <0.05 were regarded statistically significant. RESULTS: In-stent lumen diameter >60% for group C stents was significantly larger and CNR was significantly lower (both p<0.05) for sharp kernels (CD; XCD) when compared to groups A/B. The FWHM-method showed significantly smaller in-stent lumen diameter (p<0.05) when compared to the manual method. CONCLUSION: 256-MDCT could potentially be employed for clinical assessment of stent patency in stents >3.0mm when analysed with cardio-dedicated sharp kernels, although clinical studies corroborating this claim should be performed. However, stents ≤3.0mm reconstructed by soft kernels revealed insufficient in-stent lumen visualisation and should not be used in clinical practice. Further improvements in spatial and temporal image resolution as well as reductions of radiation exposure and image noise have to be accomplished for the ambitious goal of characterising both CT coronary artery anatomy and in-stent lumen.",Steen H; André F; Korosoglou G; Mueller D; Hosch W; Kauczor HU; Giannitsis E; Katus HA,,2011,European journal of radiology,Journal Article,
2D,38682630,[Comparison of the clinical efficacy of all-inside arthroscopic lateral ligament augmentation procedure and Broström procedure for the treatment of chronic lateral rotational ankle instability].,"Objective: To compare the clinical efficacy of patients with chronic lateral rotational ankle instability(CLRAI) after all-inside arthroscopic lateral ligament augmentation procedure and Broström procedure. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study. The clinical and imaging data of 106 CLRAI patients were collected at the Xuzhou Central Hospital from January 2021 to December 2022. The patients included 55 males and 51 females with an age of (32.6±8.2) years (range: 16 to 50 years). All patients were treated under all-inside arthroscopic, and were divided into Broström-Gould surgery group (n=54) and Broström surgery group (n=52) according to different ligament repair methods. At 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, ankle inversion stress tests and anterior drawer tests were used to examine the stability of the ankle joint and observe gait. The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle hindfoot scale (AOFAS-AH) and Karlsson ankle function score (KAFS) were used to assess ankle function; Tegner score was used to assess the patient's level of exercise; the foot and ankle outcome score(FAOS)(including score of symptoms,pain,function, daily living,function, sports and recreational activities (sport); quality of life (QOL) was used to assess the patient's daily activity ability. Comparisons of data were made using independent sample t test, repeated measures analysis of variance, LSD-t multiple comparison method, χ(2) test or Mann-Whitney U test. Results: All operations were successfully accomplished. All incisions healed by first intention, without evidence of postoperative complications of implant rejection, ligation reaction, and nerve and vessel injury. All patients were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Ankle varus stress test and anterior drawer test were negative. No evidence supporting lateral ankle instability was obtained. All patients eventually regained normal gait. No patients underwent revision surgery. Repeated measurement analysis of variance showed that AOFAS-AH, Tegner, KAFS and FAOS scores in the Brostrom-Gould group and the Brostrom group were significantly higher than those before surgery (P<0.01). The change trends of Tegner score and FAOS-sport score were significantly different between the two groups (F=18.839, P<0.01; F=8.169, P=0.005). Multiple comparisons revealed that at 3-, 6-and 12-month follow-up, the Tegner scores (3 months: 3.7±0.5 vs. 3.3±0.5, t=-3.980, P<0.01; 6 months: 4.4±0.6 vs. 3.8±0.7, t=-4.792,P<0.01; 12 months: 5.8±0.9 vs. 5.1±1.0, t=-3.889,P<0.01), sport scores (3 months: 82.5±3.7 vs. 79.3±3.8, LSD-t=-4.316, P<0.01; 6 months: 88.5±4.9 vs. 85.7±3.8, LSD-t=-3.312,P=0.001;12 months: 90.1±4.3 vs. 88.2±5.1, LSD-t=-2.112,P=0.037) in the Broström-Gould surgery group were higher than those in the Broström surgery group, with statistical significances. Conclusions: Both Broström-Gould and Broström procedures under all-inside arthroscopic can make ankle stability and improve ankle function in the treatment of CLRAI. However, the former maybe shorten the time to return to exercise and achieve higher motor function.",Luo X; Xue C; Chen J; Xue Y; Feng SM,,2024,Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery],Comparative Study; English Abstract; Journal Article,H2023023/Research Project of Jiangsu Provincial Health Commission/; XWRCHT20220047/Xuzhou Medical Key Talents Program/
2D,36382162,Clinical Outcomes of Rotational Atherectomy in Heavily Calcified Lesions: Evidence From the Largest Cardiac Center in Thailand.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding the clinical outcomes of rotational atherectomy (RA) in middle-income countries is limited. We analyzed the clinical outcomes of patients with heavily calcified coronary lesions who underwent RA-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and explored the risks for developing major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective cohort analysis that enrolled consecutive patients who underwent RA-assisted PCI at the largest tertiary hospital in Thailand. The primary endpoint is the incidence of MACCE during the first-year follow-up. MACCE consists of cardiac death, ischemic stroke, definite stent thrombosis, target lesion revascularization, and target vessel revascularization. RESULTS: From January 2015 to December 2018, 616 patients (663 lesions) were enrolled. The mean age was 72.8 ± 9.7 years, 292 (47.4%) patients were female and 523 (84.9%) completed one-year follow-up. Drug-eluting stents were deployed in 606 (91.4%) lesions. The RA success rate - defined as when the operator successfully passed the burr across the target lesion - was 99.4% and the angiographic success rate was 94.8%. 130 (21.4%) procedures developed periprocedural complications. The cumulative MACCE rate at 30-days was 1.5% and at 1-year was 6.3%. The in-hospital mortality rate was 1.1% and the cardiac death rate was 1.6%. Independent risk factors for developing MACCE included the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (hazard ratio [HR] 3.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54-10.21; P = 0.004), a history coronary artery bypass graft (HR 2.30, 95% CI 1.01-5.25; P = 0.048), and increased serum creatinine (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04-1.30; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: RA is an effective revascularization technique for heavily calcified lesions. This study demonstrates a high success rate and good short- to intermediate-term results of RA-assisted PCI in middle-income countries which are similar to high-income countries. Nevertheless, the rate of periprocedural complications remains high.",Towashiraporn K; Krittayaphong R; Tresukosol D; Phankingthongkum R; Tungsubutra W; Wongpraparut N; Chunhamaneewat N; Phichaphop A; Panchavinnin P; Reanthong T; Chotinaiwattarakul C,Debulking the calcified lesion; major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events; percutaneous coronary intervention,2022,Global heart,Journal Article,
2D,32804649,Fast 3-D Velocity Estimation in 4-D Using a 62 + 62 Row-Column Addressed Array.,"This article presents an imaging scheme capable of estimating the full 3-D velocity vector field in a volume using row-column addressed arrays (RCAs) at a high volume rate. A 62 + 62 RCA array is employed with an interleaved synthetic aperture sequence. It contains repeated emissions with rows and columns interleaved with B-mode emissions. The sequence contains 80 emissions in total and can provide continuous volumetric data at a volume rate above 125 Hz. A transverse oscillation cross correlation estimator determines all three velocity components. The approach is investigated using Field II simulations and measurements using a specially built 3-MHz 62 + 62 RCA array connected to the SARUS experimental scanner. Both the B-mode and flow sequences have a penetration depth of 14 cm when measured on a tissue-mimicking phantom (0.5-dB/[ [Formula: see text]] attenuation). Simulations of a parabolic flow in a 12-mm-diameter vessel at a depth of 30 mm, beam-to-flow angle of 90°, and xy-rotation of 45° gave a standard deviation (SD) of (3.3, 3.4, 0.4)% and bias of (-3.3, -3.9, -0.1)%, for ( v(x) , v(y) , and v(z) ). Decreasing the beam-to-flow angle to 60° gave an SD of (8.9, 9.1, 0.8)% and bias of (-7.6, -9.5, -7.2)%, showing a slight increase. Measurements were carried out using a similar setup, and pulsing at 2 kHz yielded comparable results at 90° with an SD of (5.8, 5.5, 1.1)% and bias of (1.4, -6.4, 2.4)%. At 60°, the SD was (5.2, 4.7 1.2)% and bias (-4.6, 6.9, -7.4)%. Results from measurements across all tested settings showed a maximum SD of 6.8% and a maximum bias of 15.8% for a peak velocity of 10 cm/s. A tissue-mimicking phantom with a straight vessel was used to introduce clutter, tissue motion, and pulsating flow. The pulsating velocity magnitude was estimated across ten pulse periods and yielded an SD of 10.9%. The method was capable of estimating transverse flow components precisely but underestimated the flow with small beam-to-flow angles. The sequence provided continuous data in both time and space throughout the volume, allowing for retrospective analysis of the flow. Moreover, B-mode planes can be selected retrospectively anywhere in the volume. This shows that tensor velocity imaging (full 3-D volumetric vector flow imaging) can be estimated in 4-D ( x, y, z, and t ) using only 62 channels in receive, making 4-D volumetric imaging implementable on current scanner hardware.",Schou M; Jorgensen LT; Beers C; Traberg MS; Tomov BG; Bo Stuart M; Jensen JA,,2021,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control","Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,37805795,[Clinical effects of expanded frontal flap and flip scar flap in repairing partial nasal defect].,"Objective: To investigate the clinical effects of expanded frontal flap and flip scar flap in repairing partial nasal defect. Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted. From January 2012 to January 2022, 26 patients with partial nasal defects who met the inclusion criteria were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Medical University, including 19 males and 7 females, aged 5 to 61 years. The surgery was performed in 4 stages. In the first stage, a rectangular skin and soft tissue expander (hereinafter referred to as expander) with suitable rated capacity was planted in frontal region and expanded by injecting water regularly. In the second stage, flip scar flap was grafted to reconstruct nasal inner lining, whose area was about 10% larger than the area of defect. The expanded frontal flap with pedicle was transferred to repair the nasal defect, whose pedicle was supraorbital vessel or supratrochlear vessel on the contralateral side of the defect, and the area of expanded flap was 20% larger than the nasal defect area after resection and flipping of scar flap. The donor site of expanded flap was sutured directly. After 3 weeks of flap transferring, the flap was delayed in the third stage. After 1 week of delaying operation, the pedicle of flap was cut off in the fourth stage. The number, rated capacity, injection volume, and expansion time of embedded expanders were recorded. The occurrences of complications including infection, hematoma, ulceration of expanded flap after the first stage operation, and blood supply disorder or necrosis of flap after operation in the second and fourth stages were observed. All the patients were followed up for 1 year at least, and the color of flap, scar of frontal donor site, symmetry of bilateral eyebrows, and the nasal appearance and ventilated function of external nasal tract were observed. Results: A total of 26 expanders were embedded in 26 patients. The rated capacity of expanders ranged from 100 to 300 mL. The injection volume was 1.0 to 1.5 times of the rated capacity of expanders. The expansion time ranged from 2.5 to 4.0 months, with an average time of 3 months. There were no complications occurred after each operation. The follow-up showed that the color of flap was similar to the normal nasal skin, the scar of frontal region was not obvious, the bilateral eyebrows were basically symmetrical, the nose had excellent appearance, ventilation function of external nasal tract was not affected, while some of the patients had downward rotation or unapparent tip-defining point of nose. Conclusions: Using the flip scar flap to reconstruct the nasal inner lining and pre-expanded frontal flap to reconstruct the nasal skin, without free cartilage transplantation to repair the partial nasal defects can achieve satisfied nasal appearance post operation, without abnormal external nasal ventilation function.",Chu FF; Tang YK; Ding JK; Zhang Y; Liu W; Ma XJ,,2023,Zhonghua shao shang yu chuang mian xiu fu za zhi,English Abstract; Journal Article; Observational Study,"81971851, 82172229/General Program of National Natural Science Foundation of"
2D,11404697,[Advances in the contributions of imaging to stereotaxic localization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations for radiosurgery ].,"Historically, angiography was one of the first diagnostic methods to allow for visualization of neurovascular structures. It has been and still is very useful for precise evaluation of vascular pathology and is one of the main elements in treatment planning for radiosurgical targets. It is the only imaging method that gives insight into the angioarchitecture of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation, possibly reducing the target volume. Construction of frames (Leksell, Fisher) that are compatible with cross-sectional imaging methods, such as CT and MRI allowed there use for planning of stereotactical treatment for brain cerebral arteriovenous malformations. The advantages of these methods are given by the fact, that they are less invasive and that they allow visualization of neurovascular structures and surrounding cerebral structures. Further evolution of the cross-sectional imaging techniques allowed reconstruction of the image data in different planes and segmentation of structures such as vessels. Use of special algorithms allow visualization of the image data, i.e. surface rendering with 3D images of vascular structures. However, such images allow no detailed insight into the angioarchitecture of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation and give rather a view of the whole volume, i.e. a ""tumor"" aspect of the cerebral arteriovenous malformation. Similar images are currently also obtained with digital substraction angiography using rotational image acquisitions and image postprocessing allowing 3D reconstruction of angiographical image data. The different image evaluation methods are thus complementary all giving useful information for treatment planning. Therefore it would be useful to develop the possibility to integrate the information obtained by these modalities. Image fusion require identification of fiducial marks, what can be performed with application of external marks or by using internal anatomical marks. Recent developments allow now use of vascular structures as fidiucial marks to obtain image fusion. This paper reports on the evolution of stereotactical planning, performed on 541 patients over a period of eight years.",Levrier O; Manera L; Regis J; Farnarier P; Ruefenacht D; Raybaut C,,2001,Neuro-Chirurgie,Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Review,
2D,26067289,Design and performance evaluation of a master controller for endovascular catheterization.,"PURPOSE: It is difficult to manipulate a flexible catheter to target a position within a patient's complicated and delicate vessels. However, few researchers focused on the controller designs with much consideration of the natural catheter manipulation skills obtained from manual catheterization. Also, the existing catheter motion measurement methods probably lead to the difficulties in designing the force feedback device. Additionally, the commercially available systems are too expensive which makes them cost prohibitive to most hospitals. This paper presents a simple and cost-effective master controller for endovascular catheterization that can allow the interventionalists to apply the conventional pull, push and twist of the catheter used in current practice. METHODS: A catheter-sensing unit (used to measure the motion of the catheter) and a force feedback unit (used to provide a sense of resistance force) are both presented. A camera was used to allow a contactless measurement avoiding additional friction, and the force feedback in the axial direction was provided by the magnetic force generated between the permanent magnets and the powered coil. RESULTS: Performance evaluation of the controller was evaluated by first conducting comparison experiments to quantify the accuracy of the catheter-sensing unit, and then conducting several experiments to evaluate the force feedback unit. From the experimental results, the minimum and the maximum errors of translational displacement were 0.003 mm (0.01 %) and 0.425 mm (1.06 %), respectively. The average error was 0.113 mm (0.28 %). In terms of rotational angles, the minimum and the maximum errors were 0.39°(0.33 %) and 7.2°(6 %), respectively. The average error was 3.61°(3.01 %). The force resolution was approximately 25 mN and a maximum current of 3A generated an approximately 1.5 N force. CONCLUSION: Based on analysis of requirements and state-of-the-art computer-assisted and robot-assisted training systems for endovascular catheterization, a new master controller with force feedback interface was proposed to maintain the natural endovascular catheterization skills of the interventionalists.",Guo J; Guo S; Tamiya T; Hirata H; Ishihara H,A force feedback device; A master controller; Contactless measurement; Endovascular catheterization; Training,2016,International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,26993650,Non-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of unruptured intracranial aneurysms at 7 Tesla: Comparison with digital subtraction angiography.,"PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate non-contrast-enhanced 7-Tesla (T) MRA for delineation of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) in comparison with DSA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty patients with single or multiple UIAs were enrolled in this IRB-approved trial. Sequences acquired at 7 T were TOF MRA and non-contrast-enhanced MPRAGE. All patients additionally underwent 3D rotational DSA. Two neuroradiologists individually analysed the following aneurysm and image features on a five-point scale in 2D and 3D image reconstructions: delineation of parent vessel, dome and neck; overall image quality; presence of artefacts. Interobserver accordance was assessed by the kappa coefficient. RESULTS: A total of 64 UIAs were detected in DSA and in all 2D and 3D MRA image reconstructions. Ratings showed comparable results for DSA and 7-T MRA when considering all image reconstructions. Highest ratings for individual image reconstructions were given for 2D MPRAGE and 3D TOF MRA. Interobserver accordance was almost perfect for the majority of ratings. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates excellent delineation of UIAs using 7-T MRA within a clinical setting comparable to the gold standard, DSA. The combination of 7-T non-enhanced MPRAGE and TOF MRA for assessment of untreated UIAs is a promising clinical application of ultra-high-field MRA. KEY POINTS: • Non-enhanced 7-T MRA allowed excellent delineation of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs). • Image quality at 7-T was comparable with DSA considering both sequences. • Assessment of UIAs is a promising clinical application of ultra-high-field MRA.",Wrede KH; Matsushige T; Goericke SL; Chen B; Umutlu L; Quick HH; Ladd ME; Johst S; Forsting M; Sure U; Schlamann M,7-T; MPRAGE; Magnetic resonance angiography; Time-of-flight; Unruptured intracranial aneurysm,2017,European radiology,Comparative Study; Journal Article,
2D,29622449,One-year clinical outcome of biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent in all-comers population. Insight from the ULISSE registry (ULtimaster Italian multicenter all comerS Stent rEgistry).,"BACKGROUND: This study was designed to confirm in a large population of unselected patients the promising results of Ultimaster® biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent (BP-SES) already shown in previous trial. METHODS: ULISSE is an observational, multicenter, national registry evaluating all patients undergoing PCI with the Ultimaster® BP-SES. Incidence of 1-year TLF (cardiac death or target vessel MI or clinically indicated TLR) was the primary endpoint. Pre-specified subgroup analysis was performed for diabetic patients and for those with lesion longer than 25 mm, bifurcation and CTO lesions. RESULTS: 1660 patients were enrolled in 9 Italian cardiology centers, 82% were males, mean age of 68 ± 10 years, and 29% were diabetics. Overall 2422 lesions were treated, 65% type B2/C lesions, 7% CTOs, 17% bifurcations and 38% long lesions. The incidence of 1-year TLF was 5%, with 3.2% of clinically indicated TLR. TLF occurred in 8% of the patients with diabetes mellitus, and 7% in bifurcation, 6.7% in CTO and 6.2% in long lesions. Definite overall ST was 0.9%, and 1.2% in patients treated for type B2/C lesions. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified stenting on unprotected LMT (OR = 4.80), stenting on ISR lesion (OR = 3.19) and need for rotational atherectomy (OR = 6.24) as the strongest independent predictors of TLF. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this national all-comers registry show that the Ultimaster® BP-SES real-world performance was comparable with that observed in the clinical trial, with low rate of primary endpoint and TLR. Long term follow-up will be necessary to prove the theoretical advantage of the BP-SES over time.",Godino C; Beneduce A; Ferrante G; Ielasi A; Pivato CA; Chiarito M; Cappelletti A; Perfetti G; Magni V; Prati E; Falcone S; Pierri A; De Martini S; Montorfano M; Parisi R; Rutigliano D; Locuratolo N; Anzuini A; Tespilli M; Margonato A; Benassi A; Briguori C; Fabbiocchi F; Reimers B; Bartorelli A; Colombo A,Biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent; Complex lesions; High-risk patients; Percutaneous coronary intervention; Stent thrombosis,2018,International journal of cardiology,Journal Article; Multicenter Study; Observational Study,
2D,37355257,High variability in physician estimations of flow-diverting stent deployment versus PreSize Neurovascular software simulation: a comparison study.,"BACKGROUND: Physician variablity in preoperative planning of endovascular implant deployment and associated inaccuracies have not been documented. This study aimed to quantify the variability in accuracy of physician flow diverter (FD) planning and directly compares it with PreSize Neurovascular (Oxford Heartbeat Ltd) software simulations. METHODS: Eight experienced neurointerventionalists (NIs), blinded to procedural details, were provided with preoperative 3D rotational angiography (3D-RA) volumetric data along with images annotated with the distal landing location of a deployed Surpass Evolve (Stryker Neurovascular) FD from 51 patient cases. NIs were asked to perform a planning routine reflecting their normal practice and estimate the stent's proximal landing using volumetric data and the labeled dimensions of the FD used. Equivalent deployed length estimation was performed using PreSize software. NI- and software-estimated lengths were compared with postprocedural observed deployed stent length (control) using Bland-Altman plots. NI assessment agreement was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: The mean accuracy of NI-estimated deployed FD length was 81% (±15%) versus PreSize's accuracy of 95% (±4%), demonstrating significantly higher accuracy for the software (p<0.001). The mean absolute error between estimated and control lengths was 4 mm (±3.5 mm, range 0.03-30.2 mm) for NIs and 1 mm (±0.9 mm, range 0.01-3.9 mm) for PreSize. No discernable trends in accuracy among NIs or across vasculature and aneurysm morphology (size, vessel diameter, tortuousity) were found. CONCLUSIONS: The study quantified experienced physicians' significant variablity in predicting an FD deployment with current planning approaches. In comparison, PreSize-simulated FD deployment was consistently more accurate and reliable, demonstrating its potential to improve standard of practice. commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

2D,36525378,Long-term outcomes following intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) for calcified coronary lesions: A Real-World Multicenter European Study.,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the long-term clinical outcomes following intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) in calcified coronary lesions from a real-world population. BACKGROUND: IVL is a relatively new but promising modality for treating coronary calcified lesions, but there is a dearth of long-term outcome data from real-world patients. METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational study in which we enrolled all patients treated with IVL from November 2018 to February 2021 from eight centers in Europe and the United Kingdom. Procedural success, complications, and clinical outcomes (cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction [TVMI], target lesion revascularization [TLR], and MACE [major adverse cardiac events, the composite of cardiac death, TVMI, and TLR]) were assessed. RESULTS: In total, 273 patients with a mean age of 72 ± 9.1 years were treated with IVL. Major comorbidities included diabetes mellitus (n = 110, 40%) and chronic kidney disease (n = 45, 16%). Acute coronary syndrome accounted for 48% (n = 132) of patients, while 52% (n = 141) had stable angina. De novo lesions and in-stent restenosis accounted for 79% and 21% of cases, respectively. Intravascular imaging was used in 33% (n = 90) of patients. An upfront IVL strategy was adopted in 34% (n = 92), while the rest were bailout procedures. Adjuvant rotational atherectomy (""RotaTripsy"") was required in 11% (n = 31) of cases. The procedural success was 99%. During a median follow-up of 687 days (interquartile range: 549-787), cardiac death occurred in 5% (n = 14), TVMI in 3% (n = 8), TLR in 6% (n = 16), and MACE rate was 11% (n = 30). CONCLUSION: This is the largest multicenter registry with a long-term follow-up showing the remarkably high procedural success of IVL use in calcified coronary lesions with low rates of hard endpoints and MACE.",Basavarajaiah S; Ielasi A; Raja W; Naneishvili T; Testa L; Popolo Rubbio A; Mastrangelo A; Bartorelli AL; Bhatia G; Choudhury A; Sundara-Raman A; Buono A; Sharma V; Cortese B; Marchesi A; Pitt M; Raju P; Wassef N,calcified lesions; in-stent restenosis; intravascular imaging; intravascular lithotripsy,2022,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the,Journal Article,
2D,23210883,Initial experience with the 5 × 300-mm Proteus embolic capture angioplasty balloon in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease.,"PURPOSE: To describe the use of the 5 × 300-mm Proteus embolic capture angioplasty (ECA) balloon catheter to reduce embolic burden in complex TASC II (TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus) C and D femoropopliteal interventions. METHODS: A non-randomized safety and feasibility study was conducted at 2 centers enrolling 15 subjects (9 women; mean age 72.5 ± 9.5 years, range 53-85) suffering from Rutherford-Becker category 2 to 4 occlusive disease. Of the 20 lesions in 15 limbs, 16 were TASC II D and 4 were TASC II C. Average baseline stenosis was 95%± 12%; 16 lesions were totally occluded. Half of the lesions were de novo, 5 were restenotic, and 5 were in-stent stenoses. Average lesion length was 284 ± 50 mm. In addition to using the ECA device, 18 of the target lesions were treated with stents and 4 with rotational thrombectomy devices. Distal angiography was performed before and after use of the ECA device to locate any periprocedural embolic events. RESULTS: Procedural success was achieved in 100% lesions. The ECA balloon was used for predilation in 11 lesions and for postdilation in 9. No distal embolization or flow-limiting vessel dissections were observed despite the complex nature of the cases. Three non-device-related complications were reported (pseudoaneurysm, myocardial infarction, acute renal failure) and resolved without sequelae within 30 days. Analysis of the particles recovered from 5 ECA balloons demonstrated a mean 257 ± 185 particles, with a mean major axial dimension of 0.54 ± 0.04 mm (range 0.11-7.54). There were a mean 7.67 ± 6.03 particles >2 mm in diameter, and all samples contained 1 to 3 particles >4 mm in diameter. CONCLUSION: In this small series, the 5 × 300-mm ECA embolic capture balloon catheter was an effective tool for avoiding embolic events in long peripheral lesions, with a good safety profile. The device might be considered as part of routine clinical practice for complex TASC II C/D femoropopliteal lesions.",Zeller T; Schmidt A; Rastan A; Noory E; Sixt S; Scheinert D,,2012,Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International,Journal Article; Multicenter Study,
2D,34828254,Expanding the Phenotype of the FAM149B1-Related Ciliopathy and Identification of Three Neurogenetic Disorders in a Single Family.,"Biallelic truncating FAM149B1 variants result in cilia dysfunction and have been reported in four infants with Joubert syndrome and orofaciodigital syndrome type VI, respectively. We report here on three adult siblings, 18 to 40 years of age, homozygous for the known FAM149B1 c.354_357delinsCACTC (p.Gln118Hisfs*20) variant. Detailed clinical examinations were performed including ocular and gait analyses, skeletal- and neuroimaging. All three patients presented with neurological and oculomotor symptoms since birth and mild skeletal dysplasia in infancy resulting in characteristic gait abnormalities. We document mild skeletal dysplasia, abnormal gait with increased hip rotation and increased external foot rotation, ataxia, variable polydactyly, ocular Duane syndrome, progressive ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, situs inversus of the retinal vessels, olfactory bulb aplasia, and corpus callosal dysgenesis as novel features in FAM149B1-ciliopathy. We show that intellectual disability is mild to moderate and retinal, renal and liver function is normal in these affected adults. Our study thus expands the FAM149B1-related Joubert syndrome to a mainly neurological and skeletal ciliopathy phenotype with predominant oculomotor dysfunction but otherwise stable outcome in adults. Diagnosis of FAM149B1-related disorder was impeded by segregation of multiple neurogenetic disorders in the same family, highlighting the importance of extended clinical and genetic studies in families with complex phenotypes.",Siegert S; Mindler GT; Brücke C; Kranzl A; Patsch J; Ritter M; Janecke AR; Vodopiutz J,FAM149B1; Joubert syndrome; KMT2B; POLG2; ciliopathy; deep brain stimulation; duane syndrome; multiple genetic disorders; olfactory bulb aplasia; precision medicine,2021,Genes,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,8355068,Rapid back to back adenosine stress/rest technetium-99m teboroxime myocardial perfusion SPECT using a triple-detector camera.,"Technetium-99m-teboroxime is characterized by a high extraction fraction over a wide range of blood flow rates, rapid myocardial clearance and avid hepatic uptake. This study determined the imaging parameters and examined the clinical efficacy of a rapid back to back adenosine stress/rest teboroxime myocardial perfusion SPECT protocol using a triple-detector camera. Acquisition parameters were determined using cardiac phantom studies which were then applied in SPECT studies of 51 catheterized patients (22 with prior myocardial infarction) and 20 patients with a ""low"" (7.9% +/- 4.3%) likelihood of coronary artery disease. Technetium-99m-teboroxime (20-25 mCi) was injected at the third minute of adenosine infusion. Teboroxime (20-25 mCi) was also injected at rest, 15 min later. Stress followed by rest SPECT were completed within 25 min using a triple-detector camera and sequential, 1-min continuous rotations in alternating directions. Summed raw data from the first to second (1-2 min), second to third (2-3 min) and second to fifth (2-5 min) minutes of imaging following stress teboroxime injection were reconstructed and compared for image quality, degree of liver interference, and accuracy for diagnostic efficacy. In a subgroup of 30 patients, 2-8-min summed images were also reconstructed to compare this more conventional imaging protocol with our rapid acquisition. Image quality was fair to good in 75% of the 1-2-min, 84% of the 2-3-min and 2-5-min studies and 53% of the 2-8-min scans. The frequency of severe liver interference appeared to increase with the duration of imaging time (1-2 min: 3%; 2-3 min: 7%; 2-5 min: 8%) and was greatest (30%, p = 0.08) with 2-8-min images. Three patients (4%) had uninterpretable studies due to intense hepatic uptake. Overall sensitivity (95%) and specificity (71%) were equal for the 2-3-min and 2-5-min stress images and appeared better than in the 1-2-min images (84% and 57%, respectively). For the 2-8-min scans, vessel sensitivity (69%) and specificity (63%) appeared poorer than with 2-3-min studies (83% and 81%, respectively). Normalcy rates were 89% for the 2-3-min and 2-5-min and 79% for 1-2-min images. The back to back adenosine stress/rest teboroxime SPECT can be performed in 30 min using a triple-detector camera. Although overall high sensitivity and normalcy rates were achieved, the protocol is technically demanding.

Recent studies reported a low rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in patients with CeAD, with no significant difference between patients randomized to anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in patients with CeAD. METHODS: All CeAD patients from 2015 to 2017 were consecutively identified by an electronic medical record-based application and enrolled in this prospective longitudinal registry. CeAD was confirmed by imaging and graded using the Denver scale for blunt cerebrovascular injury. Patients were followed for 12 months for MACE defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or death. RESULTS: The cohort included 111 CeAD patients (age 53 ± 15.9 years, 56% Caucasian, 50% female). CeAD was detected by magnetic resonance (5%), computed tomography (88%), or catheter angiography (7%). CeAD was noted in the carotid (59%), vertebral (39%), and basilar (2%) arteries, 82% of which were extracranial dissections. CeAD was classified as grade I, II, III, and IV in 16, 33, 19, and 32%, respectively. A total of 40% of dissections were due to known trauma. A predisposing factor was noted in the majority (78%) of patients, including violent sneezing (21%), carrying a heavy load (19%), sports/recreational activity (11%), chiropractic manipulation (9%), abrupt/prolonged rotation of head (9%), and prolonged phone use (9%). At presentation, 41% had a stroke, 5% had TIA, 39% had headache, and 36% were asymptomatic. Favorable outcome defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 was noted in 68% at 3 months and 71% at 12 months. The rate of MACEs at 3 and 12 months was 11 and 14%, respectively, with more events observed in patients who were not receiving anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy due to contraindications (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: We report diagnostic characteristics, as well as short- and long-term outcomes of CeAD. A high MACE rate was observed within the first 2 weeks of CeAD diagnosis, notably in patients not initiated on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy.",Rosati LM; Vezzetti A; Redd KT; McMillian B; Giamberardino L; Kodumuri N; Kothari R; Yallapragada AV; Sen S,Anticoagulation; Antiplatelet; Cervical artery dissection,2020,"Cerebrovascular diseases (Basel, Switzerland)","Journal Article; Observational Study; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,27303677,A Three-Dimensional Cell Culture Model To Study Enterovirus Infection of Polarized Intestinal Epithelial Cells.,"Despite serving as the primary entry portal for coxsackievirus B (CVB), little is known about CVB infection of the intestinal epithelium, owing at least in part to the lack of suitable in vivo models and the inability of cultured cells to recapitulate the complexity and structure associated with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Here, we report on the development of a three-dimensional (3-D) organotypic cell culture model of Caco-2 cells to model CVB infection of the gastrointestinal epithelium. We show that Caco-2 cells grown in 3-D using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor recapitulate many of the properties of the intestinal epithelium, including the formation of well-developed tight junctions, apical-basolateral polarity, brush borders, and multicellular complexity. In addition, transcriptome analyses using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) revealed the induction of a number of genes associated with intestinal epithelial differentiation and/or intestinal processes in vivo when Caco-2 cells were cultured in 3-D. Applying this model to CVB infection, we found that although the levels of intracellular virus production were similar in two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D Caco-2 cell cultures, the release of infectious CVB was enhanced in 3-D cultures at early stages of infection. Unlike CVB, the replication of poliovirus (PV) was significantly reduced in 3-D Caco-2 cell cultures. Collectively, our studies show that Caco-2 cells grown in 3-D using the RWV bioreactor provide a cell culture model that structurally and transcriptionally represents key aspects of cells in the human GI tract and can thus be used to expand our understanding of enterovirus-host interactions in intestinal epithelial cells. IMPORTANCE Coxsackievirus B (CVB), a member of the enterovirus family of RNA viruses, is associated with meningitis, pericarditis, diabetes, dilated cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis, among other pathologies. CVB is transmitted via the fecal-oral route and encounters the epithelium lining the gastrointestinal tract early in infection. The lack of suitable in vivo and in vitro models to study CVB infection of the gastrointestinal epithelium has limited our understanding of the events that surround infection of these specialized cells. Here, we report on the development of a three-dimensional (3-D) organotypic cell culture model of human intestinal epithelial cells that better models the gastrointestinal epithelium in vivo. By applying this 3-D model, which recapitulates many aspects of the gastrointestinal epithelium in vivo, to the study of CVB infection, our work provides a new cell system to model the mechanisms by which CVB infects the intestinal epithelium, which may have a profound impact on CVB pathogenesis.

2D,26030441,The Effect of OSM on MC3T3-E1 Osteoblastic Cells in Simulated Microgravity with Radiation.,"Bone deterioration is a challenge in long-term spaceflight with significant connections to patients experiencing disuse bone loss. Prolonged unloading and radiation exposure, defining characteristics of space travel, have both been associated with changes in inflammatory signaling via IL-6 class cytokines in bone. While there is also evidence for perturbed IL-6 class signaling in spaceflight, there has been scant examination of the connections between microgravity, radiation, and inflammatory stimuli in bone. Our lab and others have shown that the IL-6 class cytokine oncostatin M (OSM) is an important regulator of bone remodeling. We hypothesize that simulated microgravity alters osteoblast OSM signaling, contributing to the decoupling of osteolysis and osteogenesis in bone homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we induced OSM signaling in murine MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cells cultured in modeled microgravity using a rotating wall vessel bioreactor with and without exposure to radiation typical of a solar particle event. We measured effects on inflammatory signaling, osteoblast activity, and mineralization. Results indicated time dependent interactions among all conditions in the regulation of IL-6 production. Furthermore, OSM induced the transcription of OSM receptor ß, IL 6 receptor α subunits, collagen α1(I), osteocalcin, sclerostin, RANKL, and osteoprotegerin. Measurements of osteoid mineralization suggest that the spatial organization of the osteoblast environment is an important consideration in understanding bone formation. Taken together, these results support a role for altered OSM signaling in the mechanism of microgravity-induced bone loss.",Goyden J; Tawara K; Hedeen D; Willey JS; Oxford JT; Jorcyk CL,,2015,PloS one,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",P20GM109095/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States; P20 GM103408/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States; P20 GM109095/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States; R15CA137510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R15 CA137510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; P20GM103408/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States

We now demonstrate that three-dimensional (3D) cultures of alginate-encapsulated mESCs cultured in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor can be differentially driven toward definitive erythropoiesis and cardiomyogenesis in the absence of ELC formation. Three groups were evaluated: mESCs in maintenance medium with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, control) and mESCs cultured with HepG2 CM (CM1 and CM2). Control and CM1 groups were cultivated for 8 days in early differentiation medium with murine stem cell factor (mSCF) followed by 10 days in hematopoietic differentiation medium (HDM) containing human erythropoietin, m-interleukin (mIL)-3, and mSCF. CM2 cells were cultured for 18 days in HDM, bypassing early differentiation. In CM1, a fivefold expansion of hematopoietic colonies was observed at day 14, with enhancement of erythroid progenitors, hematopoietic genes (Gata-2 and SCL), erythroid genes (EKLF and β-major globin), and proteins (Gata-1 and β-globin), although ζ-globin was not expressed. In contrast, CM2 primarily produced beating colonies in standard hematopoietic colony assay and expressed early cardiomyogenic markers, anti-sarcomeric α-actinin and Gata-4. In conclusion, a scalable, automatable, integrated, 3D bioprocess for the differentiation of mESC toward definitive erythroblasts has been established. Interestingly, cardiomyogenesis was also directed in a specific protocol with HepG2 CM and hematopoietic cytokines making this platform a useful tool for the study of erythroid and cardiomyogenic development.",Fauzi I; Panoskaltsis N; Mantalaris A,,2014,Stem cells and development,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,23053434,Microbial products alter the expression of membrane-associated mucin and antimicrobial peptides in a three-dimensional human endocervical epithelial cell model.,"Our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate tissue-specific mucosal defense can be limited by the lack of appropriate human in vitro models. The endocervix lies between the microbe-rich vaginal cavity and the relatively sterile endometrium and is a major portal of entry for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in women. The endocervix is lined with a simple epithelium, and these cells produce mucus, which plays a key role in immune defense and reproduction. Here we describe the development of a human three-dimensional endocervical epithelial cell model generated by rotating wall vessel bioreactor technology. The model is composed of cellular aggregates that recapitulate major structural and barrier properties essential for the function and protection of the endocervix, including junctional complexes, microvilli, innate immune receptors, antimicrobial peptides, and mucins, the major structural component of mucus. Using this model, we also report, for the first time, that the membrane-associated mucin genes MUC1, MUC4, and MUC16 are differentially regulated in these aggregates by different bacterial and viral products. Differential induction of antimicrobial peptides was also observed with these products. Together these data define unique and flexible innate endocervical immune signatures that follow exposure to microbial products and that likely play a critical role in the outcome of pathogen challenge at this site.",Radtke AL; Quayle AJ; Herbst-Kralovetz MM,,2012,Biology of reproduction,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",R21 AI095859/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States; AI095859/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States
2D,20073305,[Repairing postoperative soft tissue defects of tibia and ankle open fractures with muscle flap pedicled with medial half of soleus].,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effect of repairing postoperative soft tissue defects of tibia and ankle open fractures with muscle flap pedicled with medial half of soleus. METHODS: From February 1998 to January 2009, 15 male patients with postoperative soft tissue defects of internal fixation for tibia and ankle open fractures were treated. Their age was 18-54 years old (average 32 years old). The injury was caused by traffic accident in 13 cases and hit of heavy objects in 2 cases. The injury was in the left side in 9 cases and the right side in 6 cases. The soft tissue was necrotic and combined with purulent secretion. All patients presented with exposure of bone and steel plate. The soft tissue defect was located on the upper-segment of tibia in 2 cases, the middle and lower-segments of tibia in 9 cases, and the ankle in 4 cases. The size of the defect was 5 cm x 4 cm-13 cm x 6 cm. The time from the internal fixation to the operation was 3-6 months (average 4 months). The method of anterograde transposition of muscle flap pedicled with medial half of soleus was used to repair the defects in 2 cases, and the method of retrograde transposition was applied to repair the defects in 13 cases. The muscle flap harvested during operation was 5 cm x 4cm-13 cm x 5 cm in size. The muscle flap was covered with split thickness skin graft (2.5 cm x 1.5 cm-10.0 cm x 5.0 cm) of femoribus internus in 14 cases, and island flap with nutritional vessel pedicle of sural nerve (7 cm x 6 cm) in 1 case. RESULTS: One case had skin graft necrosis 5 days after operation and healed after re-debridement, vacuum sealing drainage, and dermatoplasty. For the rest 14 patients, the incision all healed by first intention, and the skin graft, skin flaps, and muscle flaps were all survived. All wounds of the donor sites healed by first intention. Thirteen patients were followed up for 6 months to 8 years (average 3 years). The grafted skin presented with good wearability and without ulceration and overstaffed appearance. At the final follow-up, the activity range of ankle was 5-10 degrees in extension and 10-15 degrees in flexion, and the gait was abnormal. CONCLUSION: Muscle flap pedicled with medial half of soleus transposition is easy to be operated with a big rotating arc, can fill the narrow cavity and repair the soft tissue defect simultaneously, and provide flat and non-bloated postoperative incision with minor donor-site injury. It is one of the effective methods of repairing the postoperative soft tissue defect after internal fixation of tibia and ankle open fractures.",Cheng C; Li X; Abudu S,,2009,Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi =,Evaluation Study; Journal Article,
2D,29156538,Combined Effects of Simulated Microgravity and Radiation Exposure on Osteoclast Cell Fusion.,"The loss of bone mass and alteration in bone physiology during space flight are one of the major health risks for astronauts. Although the lack of weight bearing in microgravity is considered a risk factor for bone loss and possible osteoporosis, organisms living in space are also exposed to cosmic radiation and other environmental stress factors. As such, it is still unclear as to whether and by how much radiation exposure contributes to bone loss during space travel, and whether the effects of microgravity and radiation exposure are additive or synergistic. Bone is continuously renewed through the resorption of old bone by osteoclast cells and the formation of new bone by osteoblast cells. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of microgravity and radiation by evaluating the maturation of a hematopoietic cell line to mature osteoclasts. RAW 264.7 monocyte/macrophage cells were cultured in rotating wall vessels that simulate microgravity on the ground. Cells under static 1g or simulated microgravity were exposed to γ rays of varying doses, and then cultured in receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) for the formation of osteoclast giant multinucleated cells (GMCs) and for gene expression analysis. Results of the study showed that radiation alone at doses as low as 0.1 Gy may stimulate osteoclast cell fusion as assessed by GMCs and the expression of signature genes such as tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (Trap) and dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (Dcstamp). However, osteoclast cell fusion decreased for doses greater than 0.5 Gy. In comparison to radiation exposure, simulated microgravity induced higher levels of cell fusion, and the effects of these two environmental factors appeared additive. Interestingly, the microgravity effect on osteoclast stimulatory transmembrane protein (Ocstamp) and Dcstamp expressions was significantly higher than the radiation effect, suggesting that radiation may not increase the synthesis of adhesion molecules as much as microgravity.",Shanmugarajan S; Zhang Y; Moreno-Villanueva M; Clanton R; Rohde LH; Ramesh GT; Sibonga JD; Wu H,microgravity; osteoclast; radiation,2017,International journal of molecular sciences,Journal Article,
2D,17201921,Yeast genomic expression patterns in response to low-shear modeled microgravity.,"The low-shear microgravity environment, modeled by rotating suspension culture bioreactors called high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs), allows investigation in ground-based studies of the effects of microgravity on eukaryotic cells and provides insights into the impact of space flight on cellular physiology. We have previously demonstrated that low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) causes significant phenotypic changes of a select group of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes associated with the establishment of cell polarity, bipolar budding, and cell separation. However, the mechanisms cells utilize to sense and respond to microgravity and the fundamental gene expression changes that occur are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the global transcriptional response of yeast cells grown under LSMMG conditions using DNA microarray analysis in order to determine if exposure to LSMMG results in changes in gene expression. RESULTS: LSMMG differentially changed the expression of a significant number of genes (1372) when yeast cells were cultured for either five generations or twenty-five generations in HARVs, as compared to cells grown under identical conditions in normal gravity. We identified genes in cell wall integrity signaling pathways containing MAP kinase cascades that may provide clues to novel physiological responses of eukaryotic cells to the external stress of a low-shear modeled microgravity environment. A comparison of the microgravity response to other environmental stress response (ESR) genes showed that 26% of the genes that respond significantly to LSMMG are involved in a general environmental stress response, while 74% of the genes may represent a unique transcriptional response to microgravity. In addition, we found changes in genes involved in budding, cell polarity establishment, and cell separation that validate our hypothesis that phenotypic changes observed in cells grown in microgravity are reflected in genome-wide changes. This study documents a considerable response to yeast cell growth in low-shear modeled microgravity that is evident, at least in part, by changes in gene expression. Notably, we identified genes that are involved in cell signaling pathways that allow cells to detect environmental changes, to respond within the cell, and to change accordingly, as well as genes of unknown function that may have a unique transcriptional response to microgravity. We also uncovered significant changes in the expression of many genes involved in cell polarization and bud formation that correlate well with the phenotypic effects observed in yeast cells when grown under similar conditions. These results are noteworthy as they have implications for human space flight.",Sheehan KB; McInnerney K; Purevdorj-Gage B; Altenburg SD; Hyman LE,,2007,BMC genomics,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",
2D,21169425,Transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to spaceflight conditions involve Hfq regulation and reveal a role for oxygen.,"Assessing bacterial behavior in microgravity is important for risk assessment and prevention of infectious diseases during spaceflight missions. Furthermore, this research field allows the unveiling of novel connections between low-fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the spaceflight-induced global transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that is present in the space habitat. P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq as a global transcriptional regulator. Since Hfq was also differentially regulated in spaceflight-grown Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator acting across bacterial species. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight were the lecA and lecB lectin genes and the gene for rhamnosyltransferase (rhlA), which is involved in rhamnolipid production. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data for this organism grown in microgravity analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Interesting similarities were observed, including, among others, similarities with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen metabolism. While RWV-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight presumably adopted an anaerobic mode of growth, in which denitrification was most prominent. Whether the observed changes in pathogenesis-related gene expression in response to spaceflight culture could lead to an alteration of virulence in P. aeruginosa remains to be determined and will be important for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention, both during spaceflight missions and for the general public.",Crabbé A; Schurr MJ; Monsieurs P; Morici L; Schurr J; Wilson JW; Ott CM; Tsaprailis G; Pierson DL; Stefanyshyn-Piper H; Nickerson CA,,2011,Applied and environmental microbiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",P30 CA023074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; P30 ES006694/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States; ES06694/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States; CA023074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States
2D,30580939,Production of recycled manure solids for use as bedding in Canadian dairy farms: II. Composting methods.,"Recent technological advances in the dairy industry have enabled Canadian farms with liquid manure systems to use mechanical solid-liquid separation paired with composting of the separated solids for on-farm production of low-cost bedding material. However, because several approaches are available, it is difficult for farmers to select the appropriate one to achieve high quality recycled manure solids (RMS). Whereas 3 solid-liquid manure separators were compared in part I of the series (companion paper in this issue), the present study (part II) aims to assess the performance of 4 composting methods (static or turned windrow and drum composter for 24 or 72 h) under laboratory conditions. Parameters evaluated included temperature, physico-chemical characteristics, and bacterial composition of RMS, as well as airborne microorganisms, dust, and gases associated with composting RMS. Because each treatment attained the desired composting temperature range of 40 to 65°C (either in heaps or in the drum composter), reductions in bacteria were a better indicator of the sanitation efficiency. The treatment of fresh RMS in a drum composter for 24 h showed decreased bacterial counts, especially for Escherichia coli (from 1.0 × 10(5) to 2.0 × 10(1) cfu/g of dry matter) and Klebsiella spp. (from 3.2 × 10(4) to 4.0 × 10(2) cfu/g of dry matter). Increasing the time spent in the rotating vessel to 72 h did not result in further decreases of these pathogens. Composting in a static or turned windrow achieved similar E. coli and Klebsiella spp. reductions as the 24-h drum composting but in 5 or 10 d, and generally showed the lowest occupational exposure risk for dairy farmers regarding concentrations of airborne mesophilic bacteria, mesophilic and thermotolerant fungi, and total dust. Drum-composted RMS stored in piles exhibited intermediate to high risk. Composting approaches did not have a major influence on the physico-chemical characteristics of RMS and gas emissions. Drum composting for 24 h was the best compromise in terms of product quality, temperature reached, decreased bacterial numbers, and emitted airborne contaminants. However, because levels of pathogenic agents rapidly increase once composted RMS are spread in stalls, bacteriological characteristics of RMS along with milk quality and animal health and welfare features should be monitored in Canadian dairy barns applying recommended separation (part I) and composting (part II) systems to evaluate health risk and optimize management practices.",Fournel S; Godbout S; Ruel P; Fortin A; Duquette-Lozeau K; Létourneau V; Généreux M; Lemieux J; Potvin D; Côté C; Duchaine C; Pellerin D,air quality; bacterial counts; cattle; compost characteristics,2019,Journal of dairy science,Evaluation Study; Journal Article,
2D,30478297,Three-dimensional in vitro modeling of malignant bone disease recapitulates experimentally accessible mechanisms of osteoinhibition.,"Malignant bone disease (MBD) occurs when tumors establish in bone, causing catastrophic tissue damage as a result of accelerated bone destruction and inhibition of repair. The resultant so-called osteolytic lesions (OL) take the form of tumor-filled cavities in bone that cause pain, fractures, and associated morbidity. Furthermore, the OL microenvironment can support survival of tumor cells and resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, a deeper understanding of OL formation and MBD progression is imperative for the development of future therapeutic strategies. Herein, we describe a novel in vitro platform to study bone-tumor interactions based on three-dimensional co-culture of osteogenically enhanced human mesenchymal stem cells (OEhMSCs) in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor (RWV) while attached to micro-carrier beads coated with extracellular matrix (ECM) composed of factors found in anabolic bone tissue. Osteoinhibition was recapitulated in this model by co-culturing the OEhMSCs with a bone-tumor cell line (MOSJ-Dkk1) that secretes the canonical Wnt (cWnt) inhibitor Dkk-1, a tumor-borne osteoinhibitory factor widely associated with several forms of MBD, or intact tumor fragments from Dkk-1 positive patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Using the model, we observed that depending on the conditions of growth, tumor cells can biochemically inhibit osteogenesis by disrupting cWnt activity in OEhMSCs, while simultaneously co-engrafting with OEhMSCs, displacing them from the niche, perturbing their activity, and promoting cell death. In the absence of detectable co-engraftment with OEhMSCs, Dkk-1 positive PDX fragments had the capacity to enhance OEhMSC proliferation while inhibiting their osteogenic differentiation. The model described has the capacity to provide new and quantifiable insights into the multiple pathological mechanisms of MBD that are not readily measured using monolayer culture or animal models.",McNeill EP; Reese RW; Tondon A; Clough BH; Pan S; Froese J; Palmer D; Krause U; Loeb DM; Kaunas R; Gregory CA,,2018,Cell death & disease,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",R01 AR066033/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States
2D,27826116,Safety and Efficacy of Advanced Bipolar Vessel Sealing in Vaginal Hysterectomy: 1000 Cases.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of advanced electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing (EBVS) during vaginal hysterectomy by evaluating urinary complications, overall complications, and reoperation rate. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort (Canadian Task Force classification III). SETTING: High-volume gynecologic surgeon practice, private hospital. PATIENTS: One thousand consecutive patients who have undergone vaginal hysterectomy for benign conditions carried out with EBVS between January 2002 and December 2012. INTERVENTIONS: Vaginal hysterectomy performed using an EBVS device. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One thousand consecutive patients underwent vaginal hysterectomy with advanced EBVS between January 2002 and December 2012 with an average age of 51.4 ± 8.9 years (range, 31-88) and mean weight and body mass index of 57.4 ± 7.2 kg (range, 42-105) and 25.8 ± 4.2 kg/m(2) (range, 19.1-38.9), respectively. Eighty-five percent of patients (852/1000) were healthy without any severe systemic disease. A single experienced surgeon performed all vaginal hysterectomies with EBVS, specifically by not applying traction during thermofusion to avoid hemorrhage, amputating the cervix to transform the uterus to an apple shape to facilitate a vaginal approach and rotation of the uterus, and placing bi-clamp forceps on the edge of the uterus and not at a 45- or 90-degree angle. Wound closure was completed with a continuous suture. Eleven urinary complications (1.1%) were recorded (10 bladder mechanical injuries and 1 vesicovaginal fistula). This was not statistically different from the rate of .64% previously reported in the FINHYST study (p = .15). The overall rate of complications was 5.3%, and 20 patients (2.0%) required reoperation. The presence of uterine scar tissue (odds ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-19.2) and larger uterus size (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-19.2) were associated with a higher risk of urinary complications. CONCLUSION: The use of EBVS during vaginal hysterectomy results in urinary and overall complication rates of 1.1% and 5.3%, respectively, statistically similar to previously reported series that did not use EBVS. The use of advanced EBVS is a safe and effective method of achieving hemostasis during vaginal hysterectomy.",Clavé H; Clavé A,Complication; Hemostasis; Minimally invasive surgery; Reoperation; Vaginal route,2017,Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,Journal Article,
2D,33851549,Radiation Awareness for Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair in the Hybrid Operating Room: An Instant Operator Risk Chart for Daily Practice.,"INTRODUCTION: While the operator radiation dose rates are correlated to patient radiation dose rates, discrepancies may exist in the effect size of each individual radiation dose predictors. An operator dose rate prediction model was developed, compared with the patient dose rate prediction model, and converted to an instant operator risk chart. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The radiation dose rates (DR(operator) for the operator and DR(patient) for the patient) from 12,865 abdomen X-ray acquisitions were selected from 50 unique patients undergoing standard or complex endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) in the hybrid operating room with a fixed C-arm. The radiation dose rates were analyzed using a log-linear multivariable mixed model (with the patient as the random effect) and incorporated varying (patient and C-arm) radiation dose predictors combined with the vascular access site. The operator dose rate models were used to predict the expected radiation exposure duration until an operator may be at risk to reach the 20 mSv year dose limit. The dose rate prediction models were translated into an instant operator radiation risk chart. RESULTS: In the multivariate patient and operator fluoroscopy dose rate models, lower DR(operator) than DR(patient) effect size was found for radiation protocol (2.06 for patient vs 1.4 for operator changing from low to medium protocol) and C-arm angulation. Comparable effect sizes for both DR(operator) and DR(patient) were found for body mass index (1.25 for patient and 1.27 for the operator) and irradiated field. A higher effect size for the DR(operator) than DR(patient) was found for C-arm rotation (1.24 for the patient vs 1.69 for the operator) and exchanging from femoral access site to brachial access (1.05 for patient vs 2.5 for the operator). Operators may reach their yearly 20 mSv year dose limit after 941 minutes from the femoral access vs 358 minutes of digital subtraction angiography radiation from the brachial access. CONCLUSION: The operator dose rates were correlated to patient dose rate; however, C-arm angulation and changing from femoral to brachial vascular access site may disproportionally increase the operator radiation risk compared with the patient radiation risk. An instant risk chart may improve operator dose awareness during EVAR.",de Ruiter QMB; Moll FL; Hazenberg CEVB; van Herwaarden JA,brachial access; endovascular aneurysm repair; femoral access; fluoroscopy; radiation dose/exposure,2021,Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,37467054,An Algorithmic Approach to Dual-System Venous Drainage for DIEP Flap Breast Reconstruction.,"BACKGROUND: Few studies compared the use of the deep venous system alone versus combined superficial and deep venous drainage in DIEP flaps. The objective of this study is to compare DIEP flap breast reconstruction using either the deep venous system alone versus dual-system venous drainage and to propose an algorithm for flap design and orientation and veins selection to facilitate consistent use of dual-system venous drainage. METHODS: Patients undergoing DIEP flap breast reconstruction between March 2017 and April 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Flaps were divided into two groups: deep venous system only (Group 1) or dual-system (Group 2). Outcomes included takeback to the operating room (OR), flap loss and thrombosis and operative time. RESULTS: A total of 244 DIEP flaps in 162 patients met inclusion criteria. A total of 130 flaps were included in Group 1 (53.3%) and 114 flaps were included in Group 2 (46.7%). Sixteen flaps (6.6%) required immediate takeback to the OR and takeback rates were not significantly different between groups (p=0.606). Flap loss rate was significantly higher in Group 1: 2.5% vs Group 2: 0%; p=0.031. Flap thrombosis occurred in 8 flaps (3.3%) and tended to occur more frequently in Group 1 but this finding did not reach significance (Group 1: 5.4% vs Group 2: 0.9%; p=0.071). CONCLUSIONS: The use of dual-system venous drainage in DIEP flap breast reconstruction decreases the rate of flap loss. Our algorithm can be used to guide selection of flap laterality, rotation, and veins and recipient vessels to facilitate routine use of dual-system venous drainage.",Jabbour S; Youn R; Kim KG; Tirrell AR; Harbour PW; Dekker PK; Fan KL; Song DH,,2023,Plastic and reconstructive surgery,Journal Article,
2D,19346190,Prenatal detection of bladder wall involvement in invasive placentation with sequential two-dimensional and adjunctive three-dimensional ultrasonography.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic capability of sequential two-dimensional (2D) and adjunctive three-dimensional (3D) ultrasonography (US) in identifying the location and extent of placental invasion of the bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients at risk of placenta previa were examined sequentially with 2D US and then with a targeted scan of the region of interest with adjunctive 3D US to determine whether those patients suspected of having advanced invasive placentation by conventional ultrasonographic evidence had placental invasion of the bladder. The images were coded as positive, negative or indeterminate (equivocal) for bladder invasion. Follow-up postoperative outcomes were obtained. RESULTS: Seven of the 45 patients exhibited characteristic ultrasonographic findings for placenta increta/percreta. Among these seven patients with advanced invasive placentation, a targeted scan with adjunctive 3D US correctly provided additional corroborative information to the 2D US indeterminate diagnosis in patients who were found with variable degrees of bladder wall involvement at surgery. CONCLUSION: 3D US may be a useful adjunctive tool in refining 2D ultrasonographic techniques to identify the extent and degree of placental invasion of the bladder. The advantages of 3D US are: (1) a multiplanar image display allows viewing of sections from sagittal, coronal and axial planes at the same time, thereby more accurately determining the location and extent of placental invasion; (2) the viewing planes of the spatial angioarchitecture network can be arbitrarily manipulated to better delineate the aberrant vessels protruding into the bladder; (3) 3D reconstruction images can be clearly displayed by live 3D in a rotation mode for a better illustrative effect.",Chou MM; Chen WC; Tseng JJ; Chen YF; Yeh TT; Ho ES,,2009,Taiwanese journal of obstetrics & gynecology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,16904548,Detection of transplant coronary artery disease using multidetector computed tomography with adaptative multisegment reconstruction.,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) may be able to detect occlusive coronary disease in transplanted hearts. BACKGROUND: In heart transplant recipients, asymptomatic coronary disease requiring frequent surveillance commonly develops. Recent advancements in MDCT allow for noninvasive assessment of the coronary vessels. METHODS: Electrocardiogram-gated contrast-enhanced MDCT scans (16 x 0.75-mm detectors, 420 ms rotation, 100 ml contrast) with multisegment reconstruction were performed on 54 transplant recipients within 6 +/- 11 days of quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Heart rate at the time of the scan was 90 +/- 11 beats/min. Coronary arterial segments >1.5 mm in diameter were analyzed by independent investigators. RESULTS: There was a good correlation between MDCT and QCA percent stenosis (r = 0.75, p < 0.01, SEE = 15%). Of the 791 segments identified by QCA, 754 (95%) were analyzable by MDCT. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of MDCT compared with QCA for the detection of segments with significant (>50%) stenosis were 86%, 99%, 81%, and 99%, respectively. The MDCT correctly identified 15 of the 16 (94%) transplant patients classified by QCA as having occlusive coronary artery disease and 29 of the 37 patients without significant stenosis (78%). In 1 patient who received intravenous beta-blockers, transient bradycardia requiring temporary pacing developed, but there were no other complications. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of occlusive coronary disease in heart transplant recipients with elevated resting heart rate by MDCT is feasible using multicycle reconstruction. The need for surveillance invasive coronary angiography in transplant recipients might be mitigated by use of MDCT.",Sigurdsson G; Carrascosa P; Yamani MH; Greenberg NL; Perrone S; Lev G; Desai MY; Garcia MJ,,2006,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,"Clinical Trial; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",

2D,107808,Experimental and postexperimental response to anteriorly directed extraoral force in young Macaca nemestrina.,"An anteriorly directed extraoral force was applied to the maxillas of four healthy young M. nemestrina monkeys. Experimental, retention, and postretention alterations were evaluated through a combination of cephalometric, histologic, and gross techniques. In view of the results of the present study, the following conclusions can be made: 1. Skeletal remodeling occurs in all circummaxillary sutures following the application of an anteriorly directed extraoral force to the maxilla. The amount of remodeling appears to be proportional to a suture's distance from and orientation to the applied force system. 2. The maxillary complex exhibited a marked anterior positioning with a small amount of counterclockwise rotation during the experimental period. 3. The application of an extraoral force to the maxilia produces compensatory deposition and resorption of bone, not only at the sutural margins but also at the external surface of the bones themselves. 4. It is possible that the experimental appliance transmits its effect to the facial bones adjacent to the maxilla through an alteration in the skull's periosteal envelope. 5. A substantial reorientation of the maxillary complex occurs following the termination of active force, and the degree of relapse or reorientation is directly proportional to the length of stabilization. 6. The dentition, through the periodontal ligament, undergoes approximately four times as much relapse as do the facial bones through their sutural articulations, following a minimal period of stabilization. 7. Extraoral forces applied to the craniofacial complex are transmitted through the maxilla and related midfacial bones, resulting in changes in such deep cranial structures as the cartilaginous synchondroses of the sphenoid bone. 8. Anterior displacement of the maxilla by extraoral traction appears to have a minimal effect on the mandible and the temporomandibular joint. 9. The number of sinusoidal vessels in the sutural ligament tends to increase in those sutures subjected to a tensional force.",Jackson GW; Kokich VG; Shapiro PA,,1979,American journal of orthodontics,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",
2D,33710791,Team-Based Ultrasound Objective Structured Practice Examination (OSPE) in the Anatomy Course.,"The clinical use of ultrasound has dramatically increased, necessitating early ultrasound education and the development of new tools in ultrasound training and assessment. The goal of this study was to devise a novel low-resource examination that tested the anatomical knowledge and technical skill of early undergraduate medical students in a gross anatomy course. The team-based ultrasound objective structured practice examination (OSPE) was created as a method for assessing practical ultrasound competencies, anatomical knowledge, and non-technical skills such as teamwork and professionalism. The examination utilized a rotation of students through four team roles as they scanned different areas of the body. This station-based examination required four models and four instructors, and tested ultrasound skills in the heart, abdominal vessels, abdominal organs, and neck regions. A Likert scale survey assessed student attitudes toward the examination. Survey data from participants (n = 46) were examined along with OSPE examination grades (n = 52). Mean and standard deviations were calculated for examination items and survey responses. Student grades were high in both technical (96.5%). and professional (96.5%) competencies with structure identification scoring the lowest (93.8%). There were no statistical differences between performances in each of the body regions being scanned. The survey showed that students deemed the examination to be fair and effective. In addition, students agreed that the examination motivated them to practice ultrasound. The team-based OSPE was found to be an efficient and student-favored method for evaluating integrated ultrasound competencies, anatomical knowledge, team-work, and professional attributes.",Weiskittel TM; Lachman N; Bhagra A; Andersen K; St Jeor J; Pawlina W,OSPE; anatomy practical examination; gross anatomy education; medical education; team-based examination; ultrasound education; ultrasound skills assessment,2021,Anatomical sciences education,Journal Article,
2D,11930069,Techniques for the detection of coronary atherosclerosis: multi-detector row CT coronary angiography.,"PURPOSE: To investigate the accuracy of different computed tomographic (CT) reformation techniques in assessing the coronary arteries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients undergoing both multi-detector row CT and invasive coronary angiography were consecutively included in a retrospective study. CT scans were obtained with collimation of 4 x 1 mm, pitch of 1.5, and rotation time of 500 msec. Retrospective electrocardiographic gating was used for image reconstruction, with 1.25-mm section thickness and 0.5-mm increment. The CT data set of each patient was evaluated by independent observers using transverse scanning, virtual endoscopic, and three-dimensional reformation and multiplanar reformation. RESULTS: Hemodynamically relevant stenoses (>50%) were detected with highest sensitivity at transverse scanning (58 of 79 [73.4%] stenoses), followed by virtual endoscopic (38 of 79 [48.1%] stenoses) and three-dimensional reformation (34 of 79 [43.0%] stenoses), and multiplanar reformation (37 of 79 [46.8%] stenoses). Atherosclerotic plaques were identified with comparable sensitivities at transverse scanning (143 of 218 plaques [65.6%]) and at three-dimensional (139 of 218 [63.8%] plaques) and virtual endoscopic reformation (136 of 218 [62.4%] plaques). Multiplanar reformation had distinctly poorer results (217 of 218 [58.3%] plaques). Combined interpretation with all four techniques increased sensitivity to 74.7% (59 of 79) for stenosis and 71.6% (156 of 218) for atherosclerosis. Calculated overall specificity was 91.4% or greater. Sufficient vascular evaluation was possible only in vessels larger than 1.6 mm in diameter. Thus, even in patients with heart rates below 60 bpm, only 80.0% of all coronary segments could be visualized, while at higher frequencies, visibility decreased to 66.2%. CONCLUSION: Although multi-detector row CT is a favorable alternative procedure in evaluating coronary arteries, its clinical value still is restricted to low heart rates and proximal coronary arterial segments.",Vogl TJ; Abolmaali ND; Diebold T; Engelmann K; Ay M; Dogan S; Wimmer-Greinecker G; Moritz A; Herzog C,,2002,Radiology,Journal Article,

2D,19875649,A comparison of optic nerve head morphology viewed by spectral domain optical coherence tomography and by serial histology.,"PURPOSE: To compare serial optic nerve head (ONH) histology with interpolated B-scans generated from a three-dimensional (3-D) spectral domain (SD)-OCT ONH volume acquired in vivo from the same normal monkey eye. METHODS: A 15 degrees ONH SD-OCT volume was acquired in a normal monkey eye, with IOP manometrically controlled at 10 mm Hg. After perfusion fixation at 10 mm Hg, the ONH was trephined, the specimen embedded in a paraffin block, and serial sagittal sections cut at 4-mum intervals. The location of each histologic section was identified within the optic disc photograph by matching the position of the retinal vessels and of Bruch's membrane opening. By altering the angles of rotation and incidence, interpolated B-scans matching the location of the histologic sections were generated with custom software. Structures identified in the histologic sections were compared with signals identified in the matched B-scans. RESULTS: Close matches between histologic sections and interpolated B-scans were identified throughout the extent of the ONH. SD-OCT identified the neural canal opening as the termination of the Bruch's membrane-retinal pigment complex and border tissue as the innermost termination of the choroidal signal. The anterior lamina cribrosa and its continuity with the prelaminar glial columns were also detected by SD-OCT. CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric SD-OCT imaging of the ONH generates interpolated B-scans that accurately match serial histologic sections. SD-OCT captures the anterior laminar surface, which is likely to be a key structure in the detection of early ONH damage in ocular hypertension and glaucoma.",Strouthidis NG; Grimm J; Williams GA; Cull GA; Wilson DJ; Burgoyne CF,,2010,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",R01 EY011610/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States; R01 EY011610-12/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States; R01-EY11610;/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States
2D,26080381,Simultaneous Registration of Location and Orientation in Intravascular Ultrasound Pullbacks Pairs Via 3D Graph-Based Optimization.,"A novel method is reported for simultaneous registration of location (axial direction) and orientation (circumferential direction) of two intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) pullbacks of the same vessel taken at different times. Monitoring plaque progression or regression (e.g., during lipid treatment) is of high clinical relevance. Our method uses a 3D graph optimization approach, in which the cost function jointly reflects similarity of plaque morphology and plaque/perivascular image appearance. Graph arcs incorporate prior information about temporal correspondence of the two IVUS sequences and limited angular twisting between consecutive IVUS images. Additionally, our approach automatically identifies starting and ending frame pairs in the two IVUS pullbacks. Validation of our method was performed in 29 pairs of IVUS baseline/follow-up pullback sequences consisting of 8 622 IVUS image frames in total. In comparison to manual registration by three experts, the average location and orientation registration errors ranged from 0.72 mm to 0.79 mm and from 7.3(°) to 9.3(°), respectively, all close to the inter-observer variability with no difference being statistically significant (p = NS). Rotation angles determined by our automated approach and expert observers showed high correlation (r(2) of 0.97 to 0.98) and agreed closely (mutual bias between the automated method and expert observers ranged from -1.57(°) to 0.15(°)). Compared with state-of-the-art approaches, the new method offers lower errors in both location and orientation registration. Our method offers highly automated and accurate IVUS pullback registration and can be employed in IVUS-based studies of coronary disease progression, enabling more focal studies of coronary plaque development and transition of vulnerability.",Zhang L; Wahle A; Chen Z; Zhang L; Downe RW; Kovarnik T; Sonka M,,2015,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",R01 EB004640/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States; R01 HL063373/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; R01EB004640/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States; R01HL063373/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States
2D,38391633,Modeling Anisotropic Electrical Conductivity of Blood: Translating Microscale Effects of Red Blood Cell Motion into a Macroscale Property of Blood.,"Cardiovascular diseases are a leading global cause of mortality. The current standard diagnostic methods, such as imaging and invasive procedures, are relatively expensive and partly connected with risks to the patient. Bioimpedance measurements hold the promise to offer rapid, safe, and low-cost alternative diagnostic methods. In the realm of cardiovascular diseases, bioimpedance methods rely on the changing electrical conductivity of blood, which depends on the local hemodynamics. However, the exact dependence of blood conductivity on the hemodynamic parameters is not yet fully understood, and the existing models for this dependence are limited to rather academic flow fields in straight pipes or channels. In this work, we suggest two closely connected anisotropic electrical conductivity models for blood in general three-dimensional flows, which consider the orientation and alignment of red blood cells (RBCs) in shear flows. In shear flows, RBCs adopt preferred orientations through a rotation of their membrane known as tank-treading motion. The two models are built on two different assumptions as to which hemodynamic characteristic determines the preferred orientation. The models are evaluated in two example simulations of blood flow. In a straight rigid vessel, the models coincide and are in accordance with experimental observations. In a simplified aorta geometry, the models yield different results. These differences are analyzed quantitatively, but a validation of the models with experiments is yet outstanding.",Jafarinia A; Badeli V; Krispel T; Melito GM; Brenn G; Reinbacher-Köstinger A; Kaltenbacher M; Hochrainer T,anisotropic electrical conductivity; bioimpedance signals; computational fluid dynamics; electrical conductivity of blood; impedance cardiography; impedance plethysmography,2024,"Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",Journal Article,
2D,28113205,Fully Automatic 3-D-TEE Segmentation for the Planning of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"A novel fully automatic framework for aortic valve (AV) trunk segmentation in three-dimensional (3-D) transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) datasets is proposed. The methodology combines a previously presented semiautomatic segmentation strategy by using shape-based B-spline Explicit Active Surfaces with two novel algorithms to automate the quantification of relevant AV measures. The first combines a fast rotation-invariant 3-D generalized Hough transform with a vessel-like dark tube detector to initialize the segmentation. After segmenting the AV wall, the second algorithm focuses on aligning this surface with the reference ones in order to estimate the short-axis (SAx) planes (at the left ventricular outflow tract, annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, and sinotubular junction) in which to perform the measurements. The framework has been tested in 20 3-D-TEE datasets with both stenotic and nonstenotic AVs. The initialization algorithm presented a median error of around 3 mm for the AV axis endpoints, with an overall feasibility of 90%. In its turn, the SAx detection algorithm showed to be highly reproducible, with indistinguishable results compared with the variability found between the experts' defined planes. Automatically extracted measures at the four levels showed a good agreement with the experts' ones, with limits of agreement similar to the interobserver variability. Moreover, a validation set of 20 additional stenotic AV datasets corroborated the method's applicability and accuracy. The proposed approach mitigates the variability associated with the manual quantification while significantly reducing the required analysis time (12 s versus 5 to 10 min), which shows its appeal for automatic dimensioning of the AV morphology in 3-D-TEE for the planning of transcatheter AV implantation.",Queiros S; Papachristidis A; Morais P; Theodoropoulos KC; Fonseca JC; Monaghan MJ; Vilaca JL; Dhooge J,,2017,IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,36736256,Ocean oil spill detection from SAR images based on multi-channel deep learning semantic segmentation.,"One of the major threats to marine ecosystems is pollution, particularly, that associated with the offshore oil and gas industry. Oil spills occur in the world's oceans every day, either as large-scale spews from drilling-rig or tanker accidents, or as smaller discharges from all sorts of sea-going vessels. In order to contribute to the timely detection and monitoring of oil spills over the oceans, we propose a new Multi-channel Deep Neural Network (M-DNN) segmentation model and a new and effective Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image dataset, that enable us to emit forewarnings in a prompt and reliable manner. Our proposed M-DNN is a pixel-level segmentation model intended to improve previous DNN oil-spill detection models, by taking into account multiple input channels, complex oil shapes at different scales (dimensions) and evolution in time, and look-alikes from low wind speed conditions. Our methodology consists of the following components: 1) New Multi-channel SAR Image Database Development; 2) Multi-Channel DNN Model based on U-net and ResNet; and 3) Multi-channel DNN Training and Transfer Learning. Due to the lack of public oil spill databases guaranteeing a correct learning process of the M-DNN, we developed our own database consisting of 16 ENVISAT-ASAR images acquired over the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout, off the west coast of South Korea during the Hebei Spirit oil tanker collision, and over the Black Sea. These images were pre-processed to create a 3-channel input image I(M) = {I(O), I(W), I(V)}, to feed in and train our M-DNN. The first channel I(O) represents the radiometric values of the original SAR Images, the second and third channels are derived from I(O); in particular, I(W) represents the output of the wind speed estimation using CMOD5 algorithm (Hersbach et al., 2003) and I(V) represents the variance of I(O) that incorporates texture information and at the same time encapsulates oil spill transition regions. I(M) channels were split and linearly transformed for data augmentation (rotation and reflection) to obtain a total of 80,772 sub-images of 224 × 224 pixels. From the entire database, 80 % of the sub-images were used in the DNN training process, the remaining (20 %) was used for testing our final architecture. Our experimental results show higher pixel-level classification accuracy when 2 or 3 channels are used in the M-DNN, reaching an accuracy of 98.56 % (the highest score reported in the literature for DNN models). Additionally, our M-DNN model provides fast training convergence rate (about 14 times better on the average than previous works), which proves the effectiveness of our proposed method. According to our knowledge, our work is the first multi-channel DNN based scheme for the classification of oil spills at different scales.",Hasimoto-Beltran R; Canul-Ku M; Díaz Méndez GM; Ocampo-Torres FJ; Esquivel-Trava B,Deep learning; Oil spill detection; SAR images; Spatial filtering,2023,Marine pollution bulletin,Journal Article,
2D,12766747,Beta-blockers reduce the incidence of clinical restenosis: prospective study of 4840 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization.,"BACKGROUND: Restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention (PCI) remains a serious complication in the treatment of coronary artery disease. Although beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (BBs) effectively reduce many cardiac events, no large prospective studies have examined the association of BBs with restenosis. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the association of BBs (prescribed at hospital discharge) with clinical restenosis in 4840 patients who underwent stent placement (60%), balloon angioplasty (32%), or rotational atherectomy (8%). Clinical restenosis was defined as repeat target lesion revascularization or coronary artery bypass grafting within 6 months of PCI. Other end points included 9-month clinical restenosis, repeat target lesion PCI (only), long-term (5-year) target lesion repeat-PCI, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Multivariable regression adjusted the effect of BBs on clinical restenosis for 15 covariables. RESULTS: The average patient age was 63 years, 75% were men, and 37% received a BB prescription. The incidence of clinical restenosis was 12% overall and was lower among those prescribed a BB (10.0% for BB, 13.5% for none, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.76, P =.004). Other predictors of decreased restenosis included stent use, age, and smoking; predictors of increased restenosis included diabetes, atherectomy, and number of treated vessels. BBs also reduced 9-month clinical restenosis (10.3% vs 13.5%, OR 0.75, P =.004), MACE (16.5% vs 20.9%, OR 0.75, P <.001), 6-month target lesion restenosis (7.8% vs 10.2%, OR 0.75, P =.006), and 5-year target lesion restenosis (12.0% vs 14.0%, OR 0.83, P =.046). CONCLUSIONS: beta-Adrenergic receptor blockers prescribed after PCI reduced the risk of clinical restenosis, target lesion restenosis, and MACE in this cohort of 4840 patients. The mechanism by which beta-blockers conferred a protective effect against restenosis remains to be determined.",Jackson JD; Muhlestein JB; Bunch TJ; Bair TL; Horne BD; Madsen TE; Lappé JM; Anderson JL,,2003,American heart journal,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",

METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of 22 studies published between 2004-2016 reporting outcomes after use of rotational atherectomy, cutting-balloon, and scoring-balloon angioplasty. RESULTS: In observational trials, acute luminal gain was higher after lesion modification as compared with control (standardized mean difference, 0.23 mm; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.44; P=.04), with no difference in acute gain in randomized studies. Compared with control, lesion modification was associated with lower restenosis in randomized trials (odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45-0.90; P=.01). Ninety-day incidence of major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was higher after lesion modification in observational studies (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.05-1.83; P=.02), but similar in randomized trials. Ninety-day incidence of target-lesion or target-vessel revascularization (TLR-TVR) and myocardial infarction (MI) was similar. Ninety-day incidence of death was higher after lesion modification in observational studies (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.04-1.95; P=.03), but similar in randomized trials. At 1 year, the MACE rate was similar for lesion modification compared with control in observational studies, but lower after lesion modification in randomized trials (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48-0.88; P<.01). TLR-TVR was higher with lesion modification in observational studies, but lower in randomized trials (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46-0.88; P<.01).

2D,32890430,Sex differences in the coagulation process and microvascular perfusion induced by brain death in rats.,"Brain death (BD) leads to a systemic inflammation associated with the activation of coagulation, which could be related to decreased microcirculatory perfusion. Evidence shows that females exhibit higher platelet aggregability than males. Thus, we investigated sex differences in platelets, coagulation and microcirculatory compromise after BD. BD was induced in male and female (proestrus) Wistar rats. After 3 h, we evaluated: (i) intravital microscopy to evaluate mesenteric perfusion and leucocyte infiltration; (ii) platelet aggregation assay; (iii) rotational thromboelastometry; and (iv) Serum NOx- . Female rats maintained the mesenteric perfusion, whereas male reduced percentage of perfused vessels. Male BD presented higher platelet aggregation than the controls. In contrast, female BD had lower platelet aggregation than the control. Thromboelastometry indicated a reduction in clot firmness with increased clotting time in the female group compared with the male group. Serum NOx- level in female BD was higher than that in the male BD and female control. There is sex dimorphism in platelet function and clotting process, which are altered in different ways by BD. Thus, it is possible to connect the reduction in microcirculatory perfusion in males to intravascular microthrombi formation and the maintenance of perfusion in females to a higher inflammatory response and NO synthesis.",Correia CJ; Ricardo da Silva FY; Armstrong R Junior; Vidal Dos Santos M; da Anunciação LF; Sobral MLP; Coutinho E Silva RDS; Leuvenink HGD; Breithaupt-Faloppa AC; Moreira LFP,brain death; coagulation; organ donor; rat; sex differences; tromboelastometry,2020,Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ,Journal Article,
2D,29370923,The Role of Mechanical Circulatory Support During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients Without Severely Depressed Left Ventricular Function.,"Currently, there are no data on the use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) in patients without severely depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) during high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We analyzed data from the global catheter-based ventricular assist device (cVAD) registry on the clinical use of MCS in high-risk PCI in patients without severely depressed LVEF, defined as LVEF > 35%. Patients without cardiogenic shock from the catheter-based ventricular assist device registry, who underwent elective or urgent PCI with an Impella 2.5 or Impella CP, were included. Patients who received MCS after the start of the PCI were excluded. A total of 891 patients were included, of whom 661 had LVEF ≤ 35% and 230 had LVEF > 35%. Patients with LVEF > 35% compared with patients with LVEF ≤ 35% were older (72.12 ± 11.70 years vs 68.68 ± 11.01 years; p <0.001), had more extensive coronary artery disease with more diseased vessels (1.90 ± 0.71 vs 1.73 ± 0.79; p = 0.005), more multivessel intervention (1.74 ± 0.69 vs 1.55 ± 0.73; p <0.001), and more use of rotational atherectomy (21.21% vs 14.90%; p = 0.046), respectively. Additionally, they had a high prevalence of high-risk clinical features such as renal failure (24.89%) and diabetes mellitus (45.37%). Despite these high-risk features, the major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral event rates were favorable overall, with no differences between the 2 groups (3.48% vs 4.54%; p = 0.574). Despite having LVEF > 35%, this selected group of patients had severe co-morbidities and complex angiographic features; hence, PCI with hemodynamic support was deemed necessary. In addition, PCI with elective MCS was feasible and safe in this patient population.",Alaswad K; Basir MB; Khandelwal A; Schreiber T; Lombardi W; O'Neill W,,2018,The American journal of cardiology,Journal Article; Multicenter Study,
2D,30354632,High-Speed Rotational Atherectomy Versus Modified Balloons Prior to Drug-Eluting Stent Implantation in Severely Calcified Coronary Lesions.,"BACKGROUND: Balloon dilatation or debulking seems to be essential to allow successful stent implantation in calcified coronary lesions. Compared with standard balloon predilatation, debulking using high-speed rotational atherectomy (RA) is associated with higher initial procedural success albeit with higher in-stent late lumen loss at intermediate-term follow-up. Whether modified (scoring or cutting) balloons (MB) could achieve similar procedural success compared with RA is not known. In addition, whether new-generation drug-eluting stents could counterbalance the excessive neointimal proliferation triggered by RA remains to be determined. METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly assigned patients with documented myocardial ischemia and severely calcified native coronary lesions undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention to a strategy of lesion preparation using MB or RA followed by drug-eluting stent implantation. Stenting was performed using a third-generation sirolimus-eluting stent with a bioabsorbable polymer. The trial had 2 primary end points: strategy success (defined as successful stent delivery and expansion with attainment of <20% in-stent residual stenosis in the presence of TIMI [Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction] 3 flow without crossover or stent failure; powered for superiority) and in-stent late lumen loss at 9 months (powered for noninferiority). Two hundred patients were enrolled at 2 centers in Germany (n=100 in each treatment group). The mean age of the study population was 74.9±7.0 years; 76% were men, and 33.5% had diabetes mellitus. Strategy success was significantly more common in the RA group (81% versus 98%; relative risk of failure with an MB- versus RA-based strategy, 9.5; 95% CI, 2.3-39.7; P=0.0001), but mean fluoroscopy time was longer (19.6±13.4 versus 23.9±12.2 minutes; P=0.03). At 9 months, mean in-stent late lumen loss was 0.16±0.39 mm in the MB group and 0.22±0.40 mm in the RA group ( P=0.21, P=0.02 for noninferiority). Target lesion revascularization (7% versus 2%; P=0.17), definite or probable stent thrombosis (0% versus 0%; P=1.00), and target vessel failure (8% versus 6%; P=0.78) were low and not significantly different between the MB and RA groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lesion preparation with upfront RA before drug-eluting stent implantation is feasible in nearly all patients with severely calcified coronary lesions, is more commonly successful as a primary strategy compared with MB, and is not associated with excessive late lumen loss. A strategy of provisional MB remains feasible, safe, and effective as long as bailout RA is readily available and may offer the advantages of compatibility with smaller sized catheters and less irradiation. Both strategies are associated with excellent clinical outcome at 9 months. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

2D,36793669,Prophylactic ECMO Support during Elective Coronary Percutaneous Interventions in High-Risk Patients: A Single-Center Experience.,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence regarding the impact of prophylactic implantation of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) for elective high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is limited. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the outcome during index hospitalization and 3 years after interventions. METHODS: This is an observational retrospective study including all patients undergoing elective, high-risk PCI and receiving VA-ECMO for cardiopulmonary support. Primary endpoints were in-hospital and 3- year major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) rates. Secondary endpoints were vascular complications, bleeding, and procedural success. RESULTS: Nine patients were included in total. All patients were considered inoperable by the local heart team, and 1 patient had a previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). All patients were hospitalized for an acute heart failure episode 30 days before the index procedure. Severe left ventricular dysfunction was present in 8 patients. The main target vessel was the left main coronary artery in 5 cases. Complex PCI techniques were used: bifurcations with 2 stents in 8 patients, rotational atherectomy was performed in 3, and coronary lithoplasty in 1 case. PCI was successful in all of the patients with revascularization of all target and additional lesions. Eight of the 9 patients survived for at least 30 days after the procedure, and 7 patients survived for 3 years after the procedure. Regarding the complication rate, 2 patients suffered from limb ischemia and were treated by an antegrade perfusion, 1 patient had a femoral perforation that needed surgical repair, 6 patients had a hematoma, 5 patients had a significant drop in hemoglobin of more than 2 g/dl and received blood transfusions, 2 patients were treated for septicemia, and 2 patients needed hemodialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic use of VA-ECMO in elective patients is an acceptable strategy for revascularization by high-risk coronary percutaneous interventions with good long-term outcomes for patients considered inoperable when a clear clinical benefit is expected. Regarding the potential risk of complications due to a VA-ECMO system, the selection of candidates in our series was based on a multiparameter analysis. The two main triggers in favor of prophylactic VA-ECMO in our studies were the presence of a recent heart failure episode and the high probability of periprocedural prolonged impairment of the coronary flow through the major epicardial artery.",Ungureanu C; Blaimont M; Trine H; Henin P; Courcelle R; Laurent Y; Van Ruyssevelt P; Lepièce C; Huberlant V,,2023,Journal of interventional cardiology,Journal Article; Observational Study,
2D,27496751,Targeting factor VIII expression to platelets for hemophilia A gene therapy does not induce an apparent thrombotic risk in mice.,"Essentials Platelet-Factor (F) VIII gene therapy is a promising treatment in hemophilia A. This study aims to evaluate if platelet-FVIII expression would increase the risk for thrombosis. Targeting FVIII expression to platelets does not induce or elevate thrombosis risk. Platelets expressing FVIII are neither hyper-activated nor hyper-responsive. SUMMARY: Background Targeting factor (F) VIII expression to platelets is a promising gene therapy approach for hemophilia A, and is successful even in the presence of inhibitors. It is well known that platelets play important roles not only in hemostasis, but also in thrombosis and inflammation. Objective To evaluate whether platelet-FVIII expression might increase thrombotic risk and thereby compromise the safety of this approach. Methods In this study, platelet-FVIII-expressing transgenic mice were examined either in steady-state conditions or under prothrombotic conditions induced by inflammation or the FV Leiden mutation. Native whole blood thrombin generation assay, rotational thromboelastometry analysis and ferric chloride-induced vessel injury were used to evaluate the hemostatic properties. Various parameters associated with thrombosis risk, including D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, fibrinogen, tissue fibrin deposition, platelet activation status and activatability, and platelet-leukocyte aggregates, were assessed. Results We generated a new line of transgenic mice that expressed 30-fold higher levels of platelet-expressed FVIII than are therapeutically required to restore hemostasis in hemophilic mice. Under both steady-state conditions and prothrombotic conditions induced by lipopolysaccharide-mediated inflammation or the FV Leiden mutation, supratherapeutic levels of platelet-expressed FVIII did not appear to be thrombogenic. Furthermore, FVIII-expressing platelets were neither hyperactivated nor hyperactivatable upon agonist activation. Conclusion We conclude that, in mice, more than 30-fold higher levels of platelet-expressed FVIII than are required for therapeutic efficacy in hemophilia A are not associated with a thrombotic predilection.",Baumgartner CK; Mattson JG; Weiler H; Shi Q; Montgomery RR,factor VIII; gene therapy; hemophilia A; platelet; thrombosis,2017,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,Journal Article,R01 HL112614/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; R01 HL112641/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; R01 HL102035/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; P01 HL044612/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; P01 HL081588/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States; R01 HL139847/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States
2D,28041814,Safety and efficacy of intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the management of spermatic cord sarcoma.,"PURPOSE: Spermatic cord sarcoma is a rare disease, which management remains controversial due to the lack of guidelines. The standard therapeutic approach is surgical: wide soft-tissue resection with radical inguinal orchidectomy, The diagnosis is made during the analysis of the specimen. The high rate of local recurrence indicates adjuvant radiotherapy of the tumor bed. The aim of this series is to determine the efficacy and safety of postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy for spermatic cord sarcomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our series included five consecutive cases of spermatic cord sarcoma treated between 2011 and 2014. The indications for radiotherapy were: R1 status after initial surgery, R1 status after wide en bloc resection and orchiectomy, high French federation of cancer centers (FNCLCC) grade, tumor size over 5cm, tumor resection during surgery. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 66years (range 46-84years). Median follow-up was 18months (range 6-28months). Four patients had repeat surgery after incomplete removal. All surgeries were orchidectomy with primary ligation of testicular vessels. One patient did not have an in sano margin after the second surgical procedure. The median tumor size was 60mm (range 30-150mm). No recurrence was observed during the follow-up. CONCLUSION: No grade 4 toxicities were reported and the most frequent acute toxicity was dermatitis. No recurrence was reported after adjuvant intensity-modulated radiotherapy. The treatment is feasible and well tolerated and seems to provide encouraging results regarding locoregional control of the disease. Dynamic or rotational intensity-modulated radiotherapy is now recommended to decrease acute toxicities while improving the efficacy of this approach. by Elsevier SAS.

Methods: In this prospective observational study, a total of 10 119 consecutive patients with coronary heart disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention from January 1 to December 31, 2 103 in our hospital were enrolled. The patients were divided into non/mild calcification group (8 268 cases) and moderate/severe calcification group (1 851 cases) according to the angiographic results.

Compared with non/mild calcification group, patients in themoderate/severe calcification group experienced longer procedure time (37 (24, 61) min vs. 27 (17,40) min, P<0.01) and stent length was longer (32 (23,48) mm vs. 27 (18,38) mm, P<0.01), and percent of rotational atherectomy was higher (2.56%(57/2 229) vs. 0.03% (3/11 930), P<0.01). One-year follow-up results showed that MACE (7.5% (139/1 846) vs. 4.9% (402/8 243), P<0.01), all-cause death (1.0% (19/1 846) vs. 0.6% (49/8 243), P=0.04), myocardial infarction (2.2% (41/1 846) vs. 1.4% (114/8 243), P=0.01), and target vessel revascularization (5.0% (92/1 846) vs. 3.2% (266/8 243), P<0.01) were all significantly higher in moderate/severe calcification group than in non/mild group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that moderate/severe calcification was an independent predictor of MACE at one-year after the procedure (HR=1.41, 95%CI 1.16-1.72, P<0.01).

2D,24780496,Two-step grafting significantly enhances the survival of foetal dopaminergic transplants and induces graft-derived vascularisation in a 6-OHDA model of Parkinson's disease.,"Following transplantation of foetal primary dopamine (DA)-rich tissue for neurorestaurative treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), only 5-10% of the functionally relevant DAergic cells survive both in experimental models and in clinical studies. The current work tested how a two-step grafting protocol could have a positive impact on graft survival. DAergic tissue is divided in two portions and grafted in two separate sessions into the same target area within a defined time interval. We hypothesized that the first graft creates a ""DAergic"" microenvironment or ""nest"" similar to the perinatal substantia nigra that stimulates and protects the second graft. 6-OHDA-lesioned rats were sequentially transplanted with wild-type (GFP-, first graft) and transgenic (GFP+, second graft) DAergic cells in time interims of 2, 5 or 9days. Each group was further divided into two sub-groups receiving either 200k (low cell number groups: 2dL, 5dL, 9dL) or 400k cells (high cell number groups: 2dH, 5dH, 9dH) as first graft. During the second transplantation, all groups received the same amount of 200k GFP+ cells. Controls received either low or high cell numbers in one single session (standard protocol). Drug-induced rotations, at 2 and 6weeks after grafting, showed significant improvement compared to the baseline lesion levels without significant differences between the groups. Rats were sacrificed 8weeks after transplantation for post-mortem histological assessment. Both two-step groups with the time interval of 2days (2dL and 2dH) showed a significantly higher survival of DAergic cells compared to their respective standard control group (2dL, +137%; 2dH, +47%). Interposing longer intervals of 5 or 9days resulted in the loss of statistical significance, neutralising the beneficial two-step grafting effect. Furthermore, the transplants in the 2dL and 2dH groups had higher graft volume and DA-fibre-density values compared to all other two-step groups. They also showed intense growth of GFP+ vessels - completely absent in control grafts - in regions where the two grafts overlap, indicating second-graft derived angiogenesis. In summary, the study shows that two-step grafting with a 2days time interval significantly increases DAergic cell survival compared to the standard protocol. Furthermore, our results demonstrate, for the first time, a donor-derived neoangiogenesis, leading to a new understanding of graft survival and development in the field of cell-replacement therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.",Büchele F; Döbrössy M; Hackl C; Jiang W; Papazoglou A; Nikkhah G,Cell survival; Cell transplantation; Graft-derived angiogenesis; Parkinson’s disease; Two-step grafting,2014,Neurobiology of disease,Journal Article,
2D,35446551,Toward Mechanistic Understanding of Mechanochemical Reactions Using Real-Time In Situ Monitoring.,"The past two decades have witnessed a rapid emergence of interest in mechanochemistry-chemical and materials reactivity achieved or sustained by the action of mechanical force-which has led to application of mechanochemistry to almost all areas of modern chemical and materials synthesis: from organic, inorganic, and organometallic chemistry to enzymatic reactions, formation of metal-organic frameworks, hybrid perovskites, and nanoparticle-based materials. The recent success of mechanochemistry by ball milling has also raised questions about the underlying mechanisms and has led to the realization that the rational development and effective harnessing of mechanochemical reactivity for cleaner and more efficient chemical manufacturing will critically depend on establishing a mechanistic understanding of these reactions. Despite their long history, the development of such a knowledge framework for mechanochemical reactions is still incomplete. This is in part due to the, until recently, unsurmountable challenge of directly observing transformations taking place in a rapidly oscillating or rotating milling vessel, with the sample being under the continuous impact of milling media. A transformative change in mechanistic studies of milling reactions was recently introduced through the first two methodologies for real-time in situ monitoring based on synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Introduced in 2013 and 2014, the two new techniques have inspired a period of tremendous method development, resulting also in new techniques for mechanistic mechanochemical studies that are based on temperature and/or pressure monitoring, extended X-ray fine structure (EXAFS), and, latest, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The new technologies available for real-time monitoring have now inspired the development of experimental strategies and advanced data analysis approaches for the identification and quantification of short-lived reaction intermediates, the development of new mechanistic models, as well as the emergence of more complex monitoring methodologies based on two or three simultaneous monitoring approaches. The use of these new opportunities has, in less than a decade, enabled the first real-time observations of mechanochemical reaction kinetics and the first studies of how the presence of additives, or other means of modifying the mechanochemical reaction, influence reaction rates and pathways. These studies have revealed multistep reaction mechanisms, enabled the identification of autocatalysis, as well as identified molecules and materials that have previously not been known or have even been considered not possible to synthesize through conventional approaches. Mechanistic studies through in situ powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Raman spectroscopy have highlighted the formation of supramolecular complexes (for example, cocrystals) as critical intermediates in organic and metal-organic synthesis and have also been combined with isotope labeling strategies to provide a deeper insight into mechanochemical reaction mechanisms and atomic and molecular dynamics under milling conditions. This Account provides an overview of this exciting, rapidly evolving field by presenting the development and concepts behind the new methodologies for real-time in situ monitoring of mechanochemical reactions, outlining key advances in mechanistic understanding of mechanochemistry, and presenting selected studies important for pushing forward the boundaries of measurement techniques, data analysis, and mapping of reaction mechanisms.",Lukin S; Germann LS; Friščić T; Halasz I,,2022,Accounts of chemical research,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,18533331,Sleep and sleepiness of fishermen on rotating schedules.,"Seafaring is a hazardous occupation with high death and injury rates, but the role of seafarer fatigue in these events is generally not well documented. The International Maritime Organization has identified seafarer fatigue as an important health and safety issue. Most research to date has focused on more regularly scheduled types of operations (e.g., merchant vessels, ferries), but there is relatively little information on commercial fishing, which often involves high day-to-day and seasonal variability in work patterns and workload. The present study was designed to monitor the sleep and sleepiness of commercial fishermen at home and during extended periods at sea during the peak of the hoki fishing season, with a view to developing better fatigue management strategies for this workforce. Sleep (wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries) and sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale [KSS] before and after each sleep period) of 20 deckhands were monitored for 4-13 days at home and for 5-9 days at sea while working a nominal 12 h on/6 h off schedule. On the 12 h on/6 hoff schedule, there was still a clear preference for sleep at night. Comparing the last three days at home and the first three days at sea showed that fishermen were more likely to have split sleep at sea (Wilcoxon signed ranks p < 0.001), but the median sleep/24 h did not differ significantly by location (5.9 h at sea vs. 6.7 h at home). However, on 23% of days at sea, fishermen obtained < 4 h total sleep/24 h, compared to 3% of days at home ( p(chi 2) < 0.01). Sleep efficiency, mean activity counts/min sleep, and subjective ratings of sleep quality did not differ significantly between the last three days at home and the first three days at sea. However, sleepiness ratings remained higher after sleep at sea (Wilcoxon signed ranks p < 0.05), with fishermen having post-sleep KSS ratings >or= 7 on 24% of days at sea vs. 9% of days at home (Wilcoxon signed ranks p < 0.01). This work adds to the limited number of studies that objectively monitored the sleep of seafarers. It has the strength of operational fidelity but the weakness that large inter- and intra-individual variability in sleep, combined with the small sample size, limited the power of the study to detect statistically significant differences between sleep at home and at sea. The clear preference for sleep at night during the 12 h on/6 h off schedule at sea is consistent with the expectation that this 18 h duty/rest cycle is outside the range of entrainment of the circadian pacemaker. High levels of acute sleep loss, and residual sleepiness after sleep, were much more common at sea than at home. The longer duration of trips during the peak of the fishing season increases the risk of performance impairment due to greater cumulative sleep loss than would be expected on typical three-day trips. Key fatigue management strategies in this environment include that fishermen report to work as well rested as possible. Once at sea, the day-to-day variability in activities due to uncontrollable factors, such as fishing success, repairing gear, and weather conditions, mean that contingency planning is required for managing situations where the entire crew have experienced long periods of intensive work with minimum recovery opportunities.",Gander P; van den Berg M; Signal L,,2008,Chronobiology international,Journal Article,
2D,34406050,"Contrast-Enhanced T1-Weighted Head and Neck MRI: Prospective Intraindividual Image Quality Comparison of Spiral GRE, Cartesian GRE, and Cartesian TSE Sequences.","BACKGROUND. Sequences with noncartesian k-space sampling may improve image quality of head and neck MRI. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to compare intraindividually the image quality of a spiral gradient-recalled echo (GRE) sequence and conventional cartesian GRE and cartesian turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequences for contrast-enhanced T1-weighted head and neck MRI. METHODS. This prospective study included patients referred for contrast-enhanced head and neck MRI from August 2020 to May 2021. Patients underwent 1.5-T MRI including contrast-enhanced spiral GRE (2 minutes 28 seconds), cartesian GRE (4 minutes 27 seconds), and cartesian TSE (3 minutes 41 seconds) sequences, acquired in rotating order across patients. Three radiologists independently assessed image quality measures, including conspicuity of prespecified lesions, using 5-point Likert scales. One reader measured maximal extent of dental material artifact and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). RESULTS. Thirty-one patients (13 men, 18 women; mean age, 63.8 years) were enrolled. Nineteen patients had a focal lesion; 22 had dental material. Interreader agreement for image quality measures was substantial to excellent (Krippendorff alpha, 0.681-1.000). Scores for overall image quality (whole head and neck, neck only, and head only), pulsation artifact, muscular contour delineation, vessel contour delineation, motion artifact, and differentiation between mucosa and pharyngeal muscles were significantly better for spiral GRE than for cartesian GRE and cartesian TSE for all readers (p < .05). Scores for lesion conspicuity (whole head and neck, neck only, and head only), quality of fat suppression, flow artifact, and foldover artifact were not significantly different between spiral GRE and the cartesian sequences for any reader (p > .05). Dental material artifact scores were significantly worse for spiral GRE than the other sequences for all readers (p < .05). The mean maximum extent of dental material artifact was 39.6 ± 25.5 (SD) mm for spiral GRE, 35.6 ± 24.3 mm for cartesian GRE, and 29.6 ± 21.4 mm for cartesian TSE; the mean CNR was 221.1 ± 94.5 for spiral GRE, 151.8 ± 85.7 for cartesian GRE, and 153.0 ± 63.2 for cartesian TSE (p < .001 between spiral GRE and other sequences for both measures). CONCLUSION. Three-dimensional spiral GRE improves subjective image quality and CNR of head and neck MRI with shorter scan time versus cartesian sequences, though it exhibits larger dental material artifact. CLINICAL IMPACT. A spiral sequence may help overcome certain challenges of conventional cartesian sequences for head and neck MRI.",Sartoretti E; Sartoretti-Schefer S; van Smoorenburg L; Binkert CA; Schwenk Á; Gutzeit A; Mannil M; Wyss M; Sartoretti T,MRI; artifacts; neck,2022,AJR.

2D,24709139,Assessing cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and otoprotection in whole organ culture of the mouse inner ear in simulated microgravity.,"Cisplatin is a widely used anti-cancer drug. Ototoxicity is a major dose-limiting side-effect. A reproducible mammalian in-vitro model of cisplatin ototoxicity is required to screen and validate otoprotective drug candidates. We utilized a whole organ culture system of the postnatal mouse inner ear in a rotating wall vessel bioreactor under ""simulated microgravity"" culture conditions. As previously described this system allows whole organ culture of the inner ear and quantitative assessment of ototoxic effects of aminoglycoside induced hair cell loss. Here we demonstrate that this model is also applicable to the assessment of cisplatin induced ototoxicity. In this model cisplatin induced hair cell loss was dose and time dependent. Increasing exposure time of cisplatin led to decreasing EC50 concentrations. Outer hair cells were more susceptible than inner hair cells, and hair cells in the cochlear base were more susceptible than hair cells in the cochlear apex. Initial cisplatin dose determined the final extent of hair cell loss irrespective if the drug was withdrawn or continued. Dose dependant otoprotection was demonstrated by co-administration of the antioxidant agent N-acetyl l-cysteine. The results support the use of this inner ear organ culture system as an in vitro assay and validation platform for inner ear toxicology and the search for otoprotective compounds. reserved.",Tropitzsch A; Arnold H; Bassiouni M; Müller A; Eckhard A; Müller M; Löwenheim H,Cisplatin; Hair cell loss; Organ culture; Organ of Corti; Otoprotection; Ototoxicity,2014,Toxicology letters,Journal Article,
2D,20924776,Simultaneous expansion and harvest of hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood.,"The simultaneous expansion and harvest of hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood were carried out using bioreactors. The co-culture of umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was performed within spinner flasks and a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor using glass-coated styrene copolymer (GCSC) microcarriers. The medium used was composed of serum-free IMDM containing a cocktail of SCF 15 ng·mL(-1), FL 5 ng·mL(-1), TPO 6 ng·mL(-1), IL-3 15 ng·mL(-1), G-CSF 1 ng·mL(-1) and GM-CSF 5 ng·mL(-1). Accessory stromal cells derived from normal allogeneic adipose tissue were encapsulated in alginate-chitosan (AC) beads and used as feeding cells. The quality of the harvested UCB-HSCs and MSCs was assessed by immunophenotype analysis, methylcellulose colony and multi-lineage differentiation assays. After 12 days of culture, the fold-expansion of total cell numbers, colony-forming units (CFU-C), CD34(+)/CD45(+)/CD105(-) (HSCs) cells and CD34(-)/CD45(-)/CD105(+) (MSCs) cells using the RWV bioreactor were (3.7 ± 0.3)- , (5.1 ± 1.2)- , (5.2 ± 0.4)- , and (13.9 ± 1.2)-fold respectively, significantly better than those obtained using spinner flasks. Moreover, UCB-HSCs and UCB-MSCs could be easily separated by gravity sedimentation after the co-culture period as only UCB-MSCs adhered on to the microcarriers. Simultaneously, we found that the fibroblast-like cells growing on the surface of the GCSC microcarriers could be induced and differentiated towards the osteoblastic, chondrocytic and adipocytic lineages. Phenotypically, these cells were very similarly to the MSCs derived from bone marrow positively expressing the MSCs-related markers CD13, CD44, CD73 and CD105, while negatively expressing the HSCs-related markers CD34, CD45 and HLA-DR. It was thus demonstrated that the simultaneous expansion and harvest of UCB-HSCs and UCB-MSCs is possible to be accomplished using a feasible bioreactor culture system such as the RWV bioreactor with the support of GCSC microcarriers.",Kedong S; Xiubo F; Tianqing L; Macedo HM; LiLi J; Meiyun F; Fangxin S; Xuehu M; Zhanfeng C,,2010,Journal of materials science.

2D,26221853,Use of Pedicled Trapezius Myocutaneous Flap for Posterior Skull Reconstruction.,"BACKGROUND: Soft-tissue defects in posterior skull can be challenging for reconstruction. If related to tumor resection, these wound beds are generally irradiated and can be difficult from a recipient-vessel perspective for a free tissue transfer. Locoregional flaps might prove to be important reconstructive option in such patients. There is a very limited data on the usage of pedicled trapezius myocutaneous flaps for such defects. METHODS: The authors reviewed existing study for usage of trapezius flap for posterior skull repair and used pedicled trapezius myocutaneous flaps based on the descending branch of superficial cervical artery (SCA) for reconstruction of posterior skull soft-tissue defect in an irradiated and infected wound. RESULTS: Two patients were operated for trapezius myocutaneous flap for posterior skull defects complicated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and epidural abscess. There was no recipient or donor-site complication at a mean follow-up of 12.5 months. Neither of the 2 patients had any functional deficits for the entire duration of the follow-up. Although this flap was able to help in controlling the CSF leakage in the first patient, it successfully healed the cavity generated from epidural abscess drainage in the second patient. CONCLUSION: The large angle of rotation coupled with the ability to complete the procedure without repositioning the patients makes trapezius myocutaneous flap an attractive option for posterior skull reconstruction. In our limited experience, the pedicled trapezius flaps are a reliable alternative as they are well vascularized and able to obliterate the soft-tissue defect completely. The recipient site healed completely in infected as well as irradiated wound beds. In addition, the donor site can be primarily closed with minimal donor-associated complication.",Singh M; Rios Diaz AJ; Cauley R; Smith TR; Caterson EJ,,2015,The Journal of craniofacial surgery,Case Reports; Journal Article,
2D,23880321,Flat-panel volumetric computed tomography in cerebral perfusion: evaluation of three rat stroke models.,"Flat-panel volumetric computed tomography (fpVCT) is a non-invasive approach to three-dimensional small animal imaging. The capability of volumetric scanning and a high resolution in time and space enables whole organ perfusion studies. We aimed to assess feasibility and validity of fpVCT in cerebral perfusion measurement with impaired hemodynamics by evaluation of three well-established rat stroke models for temporary and permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to temporary (group I: suture model) and permanent (group II: suture model; III: macrosphere model) MCAO and to a control group. Perfusion scans with respect to cerebral blood flow (CBF) and volume (CBV) were performed 24h post intervention by fpVCT, using a Gantry rotation time of 1s and a total scanning time of 30s. Postmortem analysis included infarct-size calculation by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Infarct volumes did not differ significantly throughout intervention groups. After permanent MCAO, CBF significantly decreased in subcortical regions to 78.2% (group II, p=0.005) and 79.9% (group III, p=0.012) and in total hemisphere to 77.4% (group II, p=0.010) and 82.0% (group III, p=0.049). CBF was less impaired with temporary vessel occlusion. CBV measurement revealed no significant differences. Results demonstrate feasibility of cerebral perfusion quantification in rats with the fpVCT, which can be a useful tool for non-invasive dynamic imaging of cerebral perfusion in rodent stroke models. In addition to methodological advantages, CBF data confirm the macrosphere model as a useful alternative to the suture model for permanent experimental MCAO.",Juenemann M; Goegel S; Obert M; Schleicher N; Ritschel N; Doenges S; Eitenmueller I; Schwarz N; Kastaun S; Yeniguen M; Tschernatsch M; Gerriets T,Animal model; Cerebral perfusion; Flat-panel volume CT; Stroke,2013,Journal of neuroscience methods,Journal Article,
2D,32190561,Optically tracked and 3D printed haptic phantom hand for surgical training system.,"BACKGROUND: For surgical fixation of bone fractures of the human hand, so-called Kirschner-wires (K-wires) are drilled through bone fragments. Due to the minimally invasive drilling procedures without a view of risk structures like vessels and nerves, a thorough training of young surgeons is necessary. For the development of a virtual reality (VR) based training system, a three-dimensional (3D) printed phantom hand is required. To ensure an intuitive operation, this phantom hand has to be realistic in both, its position relative to the driller as well as in its haptic features. The softest 3D printing material available on the market, however, is too hard to imitate human soft tissue. Therefore, a support-material (SUP) filled metamaterial is used to soften the raw material. Realistic haptic features are important to palpate protrusions of the bone to determine the drilling starting point and angle. An optical real-time tracking is used to transfer position and rotation to the training system. METHODS: A metamaterial already developed in previous work is further improved by use of a new unit cell. Thus, the amount of SUP within the volume can be increased and the tissue is softened further. In addition, the human anatomy is transferred to the entire hand model. A subcutaneous fat layer and penetration of air through pores into the volume simulate shiftability of skin layers. For optical tracking, a rotationally symmetrical marker attached to the phantom hand with corresponding reference marker is developed. In order to ensure trouble-free position transmission, various types of marker point applications are tested. RESULTS: Several cuboid and forearm sample prints lead to a final 30 centimeter long hand model. The whole haptic phantom could be printed faultless within about 17 hours. The metamaterial consisting of the new unit cell results in an increased SUP share of 4.32%. Validated by an expert surgeon study, this allows in combination with a displacement of the uppermost skin layer a good palpability of the bones. Tracking of the hand marker in dodecahedron design works trouble-free in conjunction with a reference marker attached to the worktop of the training system. CONCLUSIONS: In this work, an optically tracked and haptically correct phantom hand was developed using dual-material 3D printing, which can be easily integrated into a surgical training system.",Maier J; Weiherer M; Huber M; Palm C,Dual-material 3D printing; hand surgery training; metamaterial; optical tracking; support-material (SUP); tissue imitating phantom hand,2020,Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,Journal Article,
2D,23246198,Heterotopic ossification of the shoulder after central nervous system lesion: indications for surgery and results.,"BACKGROUND: Heterotopic ossification (HO) of the shoulder after central nervous system damage has seldom been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective study from 1993 to 2009 including patients who underwent surgery for troublesome shoulder HO. Demographic data, HO location, surgical approach, preoperative and postoperative shoulder range of motion, etiologies, and postoperative complications were collected from patients' files. RESULTS: We found 19 shoulder HOs in 16 patients (traumatic brain injury in 11, spinal cord injury in 2, stroke in 1, and cerebral anoxia in 2). The data in 2 files were incomplete and were therefore not used. HO locations around the joint were anteroinferomedial in 4 (21.1%), posteroinferomedial in 5 (26.3%), encircling in 3 (15.8%), superior in 1 (5.3%), and mixed (2 associated HOs that are not encircling) in 6 (31.6%). The surgical approaches were as follows: deltopectoral, 5 (26.3%); Neer, 3 (15.8%); posterior, 5 (26.3%); axillary, 1 (5.3%); Martini, 2 (10.5%); posterior associated with deltopectoral, 2 (10.5%); and Neer (superolateral) associated with deltopectoral, 1 (5.3%). The mean range of motion increased significantly (gain at follow-up of 69°, 60°, and 13° in forward elevation, abduction, and lateral rotation, respectively). Regarding postoperative complications, there was 1 case of capsulitis and 1 reoperation for insufficient excision (because of hemorrhage during surgery). There were no other side effects. CONCLUSION: Anatomic relations with nerves and vessels, as well as limited range of motion, require a case-by-case surgical approach, a preoperative scan (looking for a gutter), and sometimes, electromyography. Surgical indications depend on the degree of loss of function or hygiene, control of comorbid factors, and discussion with the patient and his or her family. Published by Mosby, Inc.

METHODS: The image data of 64-slice spiral CT scanning was obtained from patients with biliary calculi. Image segmentation was performed both using computer programs and manually, and 3D reconstruction of the liver was carried out using Mimics software. The reconstructed model of the liver and the ductal system was exported in STL format, and then into the FreeForm Modeling System for modification and smoothing, followed by image registration of the liver with the ductal system and the calculi. RESULTS: The reconstructed liver model accurately represented the actual size of the liver and its anatomic landmarks, and by adjusting the transparency of the liver, the hepatic and intrahepatic arteries, veins, the portal vein, some abdominal vessels and the biliary system with the calculi were clearly visualized. The calculi in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts were distinct in terms of the location and number, and dilation and stenosis of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts were also clearly observed. The model presented with realistic profile of the liver that allowed vivid 3D observation. The model also allowed zooming and rotation for observation in full views. CONCLUSIONS: The reconstructed model of the liver and its ductal system can be useful for preoperative planning and intraoperative complete removal of the calculi from the bile duct, and for the bile duct dilation and stenosis detected in the model, appropriate measures should be taken to reduce the residual calculi and prevent reoccurrence.",Fang CH; Chang X; Lu CM; Yang J; Xiang N; Bao SS; Peng FP; Pan JH,,2008,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,7924506,Bilateral vs single internal thoracic artery grafting for left main coronary artery occlusion.,"This study was conducted to compare the coronary flow distributed by single and bilateral internal thoracic artery (ITA) grafts in the setting of the left main coronary occlusion. Ten dogs underwent coronary artery bypass grafting through a left thoracotomy, off pump, using a brief local occlusion to perform the anastomosis. Dogs were randomly assigned to receive either a single left ITA (LITA) graft to the circumflex coronary artery (CFX), or bilateral ITA grafts, with additional placement of the right ITA (RITA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). After the grafts were placed, the left main coronary artery was ligated. Electromagnetic flows were obtained in the LAD and the CFX proximally and distally to ITA grafts in both groups before grafting and after grafting. ITA flow in situ was also measured before rotation from the chest wall. Total left ventricular flow requirements were satisfied equally well by either a single LITA graft (116.7 +/- 11.6 mL/min) or bilateral ITA grafts (total, 116.8 +/- 9.6 mL/min divided as LITA, 55.9 +/- 7.4 mL/min; RITA, 60.9 +/- 12.0 mL/min). When two grafts were replaced, competitive flow in the proximal regions of both native vessels was noted, although basal flow requirements were maintained. When an individual graft was occluded in the bilaterally grafted system, the remaining graft immediately recruited the additional flow, demonstrating that either right or left ITA can support flow demands five to six times higher than in situ chest wall flow (RITA, 21.9 +/- 3.1 mL/min; LITA, 22.3 +/- 4.9 mL/min). These data suggest that in this canine model, a single ITA graft can support the entire flow requirements of the left ventricle. Assuming no intervening stenosis is present in native coronary systems, bilateral ITA grafting may provide a margin of safety, but under resting conditions, provides no perfusion advantages over a single ITA graft.",Otaki M; Lust RM; Sun YS; Norton TO; Spence PA; Zeri RS; Hopson SB; Chitwood R Jr,,1994,Chest,Comparative Study; Journal Article,

RESULTS: Dynamic CTA demonstrated sufficient spatio-temporal resolution to elucidate first-pass and recirculation dynamics of contrast bolus through neurovasclaur pathologies and phasic blood flow though lower-limb vasculature and grafts. The high spatial resolution of fpVCT resulted in reduced partial volume and metal beam-hardening artefacts. This facilitated assessment of vascular lumen in the presence of calcified plaque and evaluation of fractures, especially in the presence of fixation hardware. Evaluation of arteriovenous malformation using dynamic fpVCT angiography was of limited utility. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic CTA using fpVCT can visualize time-varying phenomena in neuro and lower limb vascular applications and has suffcient diagnostic imaging quality to evaluate a number of pathologies affecting these regions. KEY POINTS: • CTA using fpVCT has sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to study phasic blood flow. • CTA using fpVCT reveals recurrence of aneurysms even after clipping/coiling. • fpVCT has reduced partial volume and metal beam-hardening artefacts. • fpVCT can show vessel lumen in the presence of calcified plaque. • CTA using fpVCT can demonstrate vascular supply to transplanted grafts.",Mehndiratta A; Rabinov JD; Grasruck M; Liao EC; Crandell D; Gupta R,,2015,European radiology,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",
2D,19472617,Development and performance evaluation of an experimental fine pitch detector multislice CT scanner.,"The authors have developed an experimental fine pitch detector multislice CT scanner with an ultrasmall focal spot x-ray tube and a high-density matrix detector through current CT technology. The latitudinal size of the x-ray tube focal spot was 0.4 mm. The detector dimension was 1824 channels (azimuthal direction) x 32 rows (longitudinal direction) at row width of 0.3125 mm, in which a thinner reflected separator surrounds each detector cell coupled with a large active area photodiode. They were mounted on a commercial 64-slice CT scanner gantry while the scan field of view (50 cm) and gantry rotation speed (0.35 s) can be maintained. The experimental CT scanner demonstrated the spatial resolution of 0.21-0.22 mm (23.8-22.7 lp/cm) with the acrylic slit phantom and in-plane 50%-MTF 9.0 lp/cm and 10%-MTF 22.0 lp/cm. In the longitudinal direction, it demonstrated the spatial resolution of 0.24 mm with the high-resolution insert of the CATPHAN phantom and 0.34 mm as the full width at half maximum of the slice sensitivity profile. In low-contrast detectability, 3 mm at 0.3% was visualized at the CTDI(vol) of 47.2 mGy. Two types of 2.75 mm diameter vessel phantoms with in-stent stenosis at 25%, 50%, and 75% stair steps were scanned, and the reconstructed images can clearly resolve the stenosis at each case. The experimental CT scanner provides high-resolution imaging while maintaining low-contrast detectability, demonstrating the potentiality for clinical applications demanding high spatial resolution, such as imaging of inner ear, lung, and bone, or low-contrast detectability, such as imaging of coronary artery.",Imai Y; Nukui M; Ishihara Y; Fujishige T; Ogata K; Moritake M; Kurochi H; Ogata T; Yahata M; Tang X,,2009,Medical physics,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,37605257,Testicular salvageability and its predictors among patients with testicular torsion in a resource limited setting: a multicentre longitudinal study.,"INTRODUCTION: Testicular torsion refers to ischemia of the testicle due to twisting or rotation of the vessels supplying the testes. It is a urologic emergency requiring a high index of clinical suspicion and prompt surgical intervention with management aimed at avoiding testicular loss and resulting infertility. This paper gives an update on the current situation regarding this topic in low-income settings. The aim of this study was to determine testicular salvageability and its predictors amongst patients with testicular torsion at two tertiary African hospitals. METHODS: This was a hospital-based multicentre longitudinal study at two tertiary hospitals in western Uganda. Patients with acute scrotum were enrolled and evaluated for testicular torsion. Those with confirmed testicular torsion underwent surgery and salvageability was reported as the primary outcome. Predictors for testicular salvageability were determined using backward binary logistic regression in SPSS version 22. RESULTS: During the study period, 232 patients with acute scrotum were enrolled. The mean age was 35.3 (SD = 20.4) years. Forty-one (17.7%) patients had testicular torsion. Only 16 (39.0%) of patients with torsion had viable testes that were salvageable. Orchiectomy was performed on 25 patients (61.0%). At multivariate analysis, a patient who presented after 48 h from the onset of symptoms was 34.833 times more likely to have orchiectomy compared to one who presented within 12 h [AOR = 34.833, (95% CI = 5.020-60.711), P < 0.001]. CONCLUSION: In this study, the testicular salvage rate was low. The only predictor of salvageability was the time from the onset of symptoms to presentation. All males should be sensitized about the clinical features of testicular torsion to ensure early presentation to increase salvage rates.",Mohamed MA; Abraha D; Olasinde AA; Kiswezi A; Molen SF; Muhumuza J; Lule H,Resource limited setting; Salvageability; Testicular torsion; Uganda,2023,BMC surgery,Journal Article; Multicenter Study,
2D,36988753,Perforated Ulcer of the Gastrojejunal Anastomosis and Concomitant Internal Hernia After One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass.,"PURPOSE: The management of concomitant complications after OAGB is challenging. We aim to show the surgical management of two concomitant complications after one anastomosis gastric bypass: internal hernia and anastomotic ulcer perforation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present the case of a 32-year-old woman with BMI of 51 kg/m2, who underwent OAGB. Three years later, she presented with intense and brutal epigastric pain. She was a heavy smoker. Her weight and BMI were 75 kg and 26 kg/m(2), respectively. Clinical examination showed generalized peritonitis, computed tomography showed pneumoperitoneum, diffuse peritoneal effusion, and rotation of the superior mesenteric vessels indicative of an internal hernia. RESULTS: A generalized biliary peritonitis secondary to a perforated ulcer on the gastrojejunal anastomosis and internal hernia of the common loop into a large Petersen orifice were diagnosed. The internal hernia was reduced, and a perforation of the posterior surface of the gastrojejunal anastomosis was identified. Surgical treatment consisted in the placement of a Kehr's drain into the perforation, closure of the Petersen orifice, and lavage-drainage of the peritoneal cavity. The postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on postoperative day 12. The Kehr's drain was removed 1 month after discharge. CONCLUSION: The combination of two different complications after OAGB can make the pre- and intra-operative judgment difficult and hamper the therapeutic approach. The initial reduction of the internal hernia made it possible to reduce the pressure in the surgical assembly and facilitated the treatment of the anastomotic perforation.",Liagre A; Martini F; Petrucciani N,Anastomotic ulcer; Internal hernia; Kehr’s drain; One anastomosis gastric bypass,2023,Obesity surgery,"Case Reports; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,16641416,Improved motion compensation in 3D-CT using respiratory-correlated segment reconstruction: diagnostic and radiotherapy applications.,"Conventional respiratory-gated CT and four-dimensional CT (4DCT) are disadvantaged by their low temporal resolution, which results in the inclusion of anatomic motion-induced artefacts. These represent a significant source of error both in radiotherapy treatment planning for the thorax and upper abdomen and in diagnostic procedures. In particular, temporal resolution and image quality are vitally important to accurate diagnosis and the minimization of planning target volume margin due to respiratory motion. To improve both temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we developed a respiratory-correlated segment reconstruction method (RS) and adapted it to the Feldkamp-Davis-Kress algorithm (FDK) with a 256 multidetector row CT (256MDCT). The 256MDCT scans approximately 100 mm in the craniocaudal direction with a 0.5 mm slice thickness in one rotation. Data acquisition for the RS-FDK relies on the assistance of a respiratory sensing system operating in cine scan mode (continuous axial scan with the table stationary). We evaluated the RS-FDK for volume accuracy and image noise in a phantom study with the 256MDCT and compared results with those for a full scan (FS-FDK), which is usually employed in conventional 4DCT and in half scan (HS-FDK). Results showed that the RS-FDK gave a more accurate volume than the others and had the same SNR as the FS-FDK. In a subsequent animal study, we demonstrated a practical sorting process for projection data which was unaffected by variations in respiratory period, and found that the RS-FDK gave the clearest visualization among the three algorithms of the margins of the liver and pulmonary vessels. In summary, the RS-FDK algorithm provides multi-phase images with higher temporal resolution and better SNR. This method should prove useful when combined with new radiotherapeutic and diagnostic techniques.",Mori S; Endo M; Kohno R; Minohara S,,2006,The British journal of radiology,Journal Article,
2D,16053973,Diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive coronary angiography using 64-slice spiral computed tomography.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of multislice computed tomography (MSCT) coronary angiography using a new 64-slice scanner. BACKGROUND: The new 64-slice MSCT scanner has improved spatial resolution of 0.4 mm and a faster rotation time (330 ms) compared to prior MSCT scanners. METHODS: We studied 70 consecutive patients undergoing elective invasive coronary angiography. Patients were excluded for atrial fibrillation, but not for high heart rate, coronary calcification, or obesity. All vessels were analyzed, including those <1.5 mm in diameter; MSCT lesions were analyzed quantitatively as well as by a qualitative scale and compared to quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). Results were also analyzed for significant coronary stenoses (over 50% luminal narrowing) by segment, by artery, and by patient. RESULTS: All scans showed diagnostic image quality. Of 1,065 segments, 935 (88%) could be evaluated, and 773 of 935 (83%) could be assessed quantitatively by both MSCT and QCA. The Spearman correlation coefficient between MSCT and QCA was 0.76 (p < 0.0001). Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a mean difference in percent stenosis of 1.3 +/- 14.2%. A total of 26% of patients had calcium scores above 400 Agatston U, 25% had heart rates >70 beats/min, and 50% were obese. Specificity, sensitivity, and positive and negative predictive values for the presence of significant stenoses were: by segment (n = 935), 86%, 95%, 66%, and 98%, respectively; by artery (n = 279), 91%, 92%, 80%, and 97%, respectively; by patient (n = 70), 95%, 90%, 93%, and 93%, respectively.

2D,30107511,Diagnostic performance of on-site computed CT-fractional flow reserve based on fluid structure interactions: comparison with invasive fractional flow reserve and instantaneous wave-free ratio.,"AIMS: We evaluated diagnostic accuracy of CT-fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) computed on-site with a new vendor workstation, against invasive FFR as the reference standard. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective analyses compared CT-FFR of 104 vessels with 30-90% diameter stenosis in 75 patients imaged using single-rotation 320 detector-row coronary CT angiography (CCTA) with invasive FFR performed within 90 days. Prospective ECG-gated CCTA included exposure of 70-99% of the R-R interval. CT-FFR was computed on-site within the same physical space as the CT scanner and reading room. The diagnostic accuracy of CCTA >50% and CT-FFR ≤0.8 to detect hemodynamically significant stenosis, defined as FFR ≤0.8, was determined, as was the correlation of CT-FFR to FFR and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR). Forty-four vessels (42.3%) had an invasive FFR ≤0.8. The sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive value of CT-FFR ≤0.8 vs. CCTA >50% to detect hemodynamically significant stenosis defined as FFR ≤0.8 were 90.9% vs. 70.5%, 78.3% vs. 43.3%, 75.5% vs. 47.7%, and 92.2% vs. 66.7%, respectively. Area under the curve of CT-FFR was significantly higher than CCTA >50% [0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76-0.91 vs. 0.57, 95% CI: 0.47-0.67; P < 0.0001]. The correlation coefficient between CT-FFR and iFR was r = 0.62 (95% CI: 0.40-0.77, P < 0.0001) and that between CT-FFR and invasive FFR was r = 0.52 (95% CI: 0.28-0.70, P = 0.0001). CT-FFR inter- and intra-observer correlations were excellent (r = 0.83 and r = 0.82, respectively). CONCLUSION: Locally computed CT-FFR based on fluid structure interaction has excellent diagnostic accuracy to detect a significant FFR ≤0.8 compared with conventional CCTA and high reproducibility.

2D,31092005,A hybrid operating room for combined surgical and endovascular procedures for cerebrovascular diseases: a clinical experience at a single centre.,"Purpose: To describe our experiences with a fully equipped high-end digital subtraction angiography (DSA) system within a hybrid operating room (OR). Material and methods: A single-plane DSA system with 3-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA), cone-beam computed tomography, and real-time navigation software was used in our hybrid OR. Between April 2014 and January 2018, 191 sessions of neurovascular procedures were performed in our hybrid OR. After the retrospective review of all cases, the procedures were categorised into five subcategorical procedures according to the dominance of surgical and/or endovascular procedures: intraoperative angiographic evaluation, combined endovascular and surgical procedure, complementary rescue procedure during intervention and surgery, surgical approach for interventional procedure, and frameless stereotaxic operation. Results: Intraoperative angiography revealed unsatisfactory clipping of intracranial aneurysms in 6 (13.6%) patients and remnant AVMs in 1 (16.7%) patient, which were determined as complete surgical outcome via indocyanine green videoangiography. Four cases of blood blister aneurysms and a ruptured posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm were treated using bypass surgery and endovascular trapping. Eight cases of ruptured aneurysm with intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) were treated by partial embolisation and surgical clipping. Two (5.4%) of the 37 cases of pre-mature rupture during clipping were secured by endovascular coil embolisation. In 1 (0.8%) complicated case of 103 intra-arterial (IA) thrombectomy procedures, emergency surgical embolectomy with bypass surgery was performed. Direct puncture of the common carotid artery or vertebral artery was performed to achieve interventional access to treat aneurysm or recanalise vessel occlusions in 7 cases. In 27 cases of ICH, frameless stereotaxic haematoma aspiration was performed using XperGuide® system. All procedures were performed in single sessions without any procedural complications. Conclusion: Hybrid OR with a fully equipped DSA system could provide safe and precise treatment for neurovascular diseases. Hybrid procedures for neurovascular diseases in hybrid OR are a promising new trend.",Choi E; Lee JY; Jeon HJ; Cho BM; Yoon DY,Hybrid; cerebrovascular disease; cone-beam computed tomography; endovascular procedures; intraoperative angiography; operating room,2019,British journal of neurosurgery,Journal Article,
2D,18550555,The potential clinical utility of intravascular ultrasound guidance in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents.,"AIMS: To assess the impact on clinical outcomes of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance during drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. IVUS guidance during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been demonstrated to be useful in optimizing stent deployment. However, it is not proved that routine use of IVUS guidance with DES implantation can prevent stent thrombosis or restenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: The clinical outcomes of 884 patients undergoing IVUS-guided intracoronary DES implantation from April 2003 to May 2006 were compared with the outcomes of a propensity-score matched population undergoing DES implantation with angiographic guidance alone. The primary endpoint of the study was definite stent thrombosis at 12 months. The secondary endpoint was major adverse cardiac events (MACE). After propensity-score matching, the two groups were well matched for clinical and angiographic characteristics. Patients undergoing IVUS-guided DES implantation underwent less direct stenting, more post-dilation, and had greater cutting balloon and rotational atherectomy use. At 30 days and at 12 months, a higher rate of definite stent thrombosis was seen in the No IVUS group (0.5 vs. 1.4%; P = 0.046) and (0.7 vs. 2.0%; P = 0.014), respectively. There were no major differences in late stent thrombosis and MACE (14.5 vs. 16.2%; P = 0.33) at 12 month follow-up between the groups. Rates of death and Q-wave myocardial infarction were similar, and there was no significant difference between groups in target vessel revascularization. However, a trend was seen in favour of the IVUS group in target lesion revascularization (5.1 vs. 7.2%; P = 0.07). IVUS guidance was an independent predictor of freedom from cumulative stent thrombosis at 12 months (adjusted HR 0.5, CI 0.1-0.8; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: IVUS guidance during DES implantation has the potential to influence treatment strategy and reduce both DES thrombosis and the need for repeat revascularization.",Roy P; Steinberg DH; Sushinsky SJ; Okabe T; Pinto Slottow TL; Kaneshige K; Xue Z; Satler LF; Kent KM; Suddath WO; Pichard AD; Weissman NJ; Lindsay J; Waksman R,,2008,European heart journal,Evaluation Study; Journal Article,
2D,29943649,Three-dimensional multimodality fusion imaging as an educational and planning tool for deep-seated meningiomas.,"INTRODUCTION: The utility of surgical simulation with three-dimensional multimodality fusion imaging (3D-MFI) has been demonstrated. However, its potential in deep-seated brain lesions remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of 3D-MFI in deep-seated meningioma operations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with deeply located meningiomas were included in this study. We constructed 3D-MFIs by fusing high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images with a rotational digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) in all patients. The surgical procedure was simulated by 3D-MFI prior to operation. To assess the impact on neurosurgical education, the objective values of surgical simulation by 3D-MFIs/virtual reality (VR) video were evaluated. To validate the quality of 3D-MFIs, intraoperative findings were compared. The identification rate (IR) and positive predictive value (PPV) for the tumor feeding arteries and involved perforating arteries and veins were also assessed for quality assessment of 3D-MFI. RESULTS: After surgical simulation by 3D-MFIs, near-total resection was achieved in 13 of 14 (92.9%) patients without neurological complications. 3D-MFIs significantly contributed to the understanding of surgical anatomy and optimal surgical view (p < .0001) and learning how to preserve critical vessels (p < .0001) and resect tumors safety and extensively (p < .0001) by neurosurgical residents/fellows. The IR of 3D-MFI for tumor-feeding arteries and perforating arteries and veins was 100% and 92.9%, respectively. The PPV of 3D-MFI for tumor-feeding arteries and perforating arteries and veins was 98.8% and 76.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 3D-MFI contributed to learn skull base meningioma surgery. Also, 3D-MFI provided high quality to identify critical anatomical structures within or adjacent to deep-seated meningiomas. Thus, 3D-MFI is promising educational and surgical planning tool for meningiomas in deep-seated regions.",Sato M; Tateishi K; Murata H; Kin T; Suenaga J; Takase H; Yoneyama T; Nishii T; Tateishi U; Yamamoto T; Saito N; Inoue T; Kawahara N,Three-dimensional multimodality fusion imaging; deep-seated meningioma; neurosurgical education; surgical simulation,2018,British journal of neurosurgery,Evaluation Study; Journal Article,
2D,34214976,Long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes after pial pericranial dural revascularization: a hybrid surgical technique for treatment of anterior cerebral territory ischemia in pediatric moyamoya disease.,"OBJECTIVE: Isolated anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory ischemia in pediatric moyamoya disease (MMD) is rare but has been increasingly recognized, particularly in children manifesting progression of disease in a delayed fashion after middle cerebral artery revascularization surgery. Surgical treatment is complicated by limited graft choices, with the small number of case series largely focused on complex, higher-risk operations (omental flap transfers, large interhemispheric rotational grafts); direct bypass (often untenable in children due to vessel size); or, alternatively, the technically simpler method of multiple burr holes (of limited efficacy outside of infants). Faced with the problem of a growing cohort of pediatric patients with MMD that could benefit from anterior cerebral revascularization, the authors sought to develop a solution that was specifically designed for children and that would be lower risk than the more complex approaches adapted from adult populations but more effective than simple burr holes. In this study, the authors aimed to describe the long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes of a novel approach of pial pericranial dural (PiPeD) revascularization, building on the principles of pial synangiosis but unique in using the pericranium and the dura mater as the primary vascular supply, and employing a larger craniotomy with arachnoid dissection to provide robust full-territory revascularization in all ages with reduced risk relative to more complex procedures. METHODS: The medical records of all pediatric patients with MMD who presented at a single center between July 2009 and August 2019 were retrospectively reviewed to identify patients with MMD with anterior cerebral territory ischemia. Clinical characteristics, surgical indications, operative techniques, and long-term clinical and radiographic follow-up data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 25 operations (5.6% of total procedures) were performed in 21 patients (mean age 9.4 years [range 1-16.5 years]; 12 female and 9 male). Almost one-third of the patients had syndromic associations, with no familial cases. Complications included 1 patient (4.7%) with a superficial infection, with no postoperative strokes, hemorrhage, seizures, or deaths. Long-term follow-up was available in 18 of 21 patients (mean 24.9 months [range 4-60 months]). Radiographic engraftment was present in 90.9% (20/22 hemispheres), and no new strokes were evident on MRI on long-term follow-up, despite radiographic progression of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the pericranium and the dura mater for indirect revascularization provided robust vascularized graft with great flexibility in location and high potential for engraftment, which may obviate more complex and higher-risk operations for ACA territory ischemia. Long-term follow-up demonstrated that PiPeD revascularization conferred durable, long-term radiographic and clinical protection from stroke in pediatric patients with MMD. Based on the results of the current study, the PiPeD technique can be considered an additional tool to the armamentarium of indirect revascularization procedures in select pediatric patients with MMD.",Montaser A; Driscoll J; Smith H; Karsten MB; Day E; Mounlavongsy T; Orbach DB; Smith ER,anterior cerebral artery; indirect revascularization; pediatric moyamoya disease; surgical technique; vascular disorders,2021,Journal of neurosurgery.

2D,28287292,[Long term results after invasive treatment of critical limb ischemia].,"INTRODUCTION AND AIM: Surgical tibial bypass for critical limb ischemia is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and graft failure, whereas percutaneous angioplasty and stenting has promising results. The objective of this study was the investigation of the long term results of below-knee percutaneous angioplasty for restoring straight inline arterial flow in patients with critical limb ischemia. METHOD: The clinical and angiographic data of 281 consecutive patients with critical limb ischemia treated by PTA between 2008 and 2011 was evaluated in a prospective register. The aim of the revascularization was to achieve a straight inline flow to the wound with balloon angioplasty. Stent implantation was done in the case of recoil and flow limiting dissection. Primary end points were clinical success (relief of resting pain, healing of ulceration, limb survival) and major adverse events (death, myocardial infarction, major unplanned amputation, need for surgical revascularization, or major bleeding). Secondary end points were the angiographic result of the intervention, procedural data and consumption of angioplasty equipment. The impact of diabetic leg syndrome and the result of the angioplasty on the limb salvage was also investigated. We have analysed the impact of major amputation on long term mortality. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 72.5 ± 10.6 years and the follow-up period was 40.8 ± 9.7 months. Technical success was reached in 255 (90.7%) of the patient's: 255 limbs straight inline flow with good angiographic result was restored to at least one tibial vessel. Balloon angioplasty, stent implantation and rotational atherectomy was performed in 278 (98.9%), 74 (26.3%) and 2 patients (0.7%). From clinical end points the rest pain was ceased in 56.6%, the ulcer and the gangrena was healed in 73.5% and 46.5%. The long term limb survival was 73.5%; 65.8% in diabetic and 89.6% in non-diabetic leg syndrome (p = 0.001). The major adverse events at long-term follow-up occured in 122 (43.8%) patients. Death occured in 57 (20.3%) of the patients during the long-term follow-up: 38 (13.5%) vs. 19 (6.8%) in diabetic vs. non-diabetic leg subgroup, respectively (p = 0.932). Long-term limb saving occured in 72.3% vs. 84.6% of the patients dependening the procedure was successful or unsuccessful (p = 0.225). CONCLUSION: Below-knee stent angioplasty for critical limb ischemia results in good clinical outcome, but the major adverse event rate is high. Diabetes mellitus is associated with a high rate of mortality and amputation. Orv.

2D,16500012,[The dorsoradial flap: a new flap for hand reconstruction. Anatomical study and clinical applications].,"The authors report a new cutaneous flap harvested from the dorsal and distal quarter of the forearm: the dorsoradial flap. The vascularisation type of the cutaneous paddle belongs this flap to the anterograde and axial family flaps. The anatomical study carried out on thirty six fresh cadaver upper arms showed a constant and a consistent cutaneous collateral branch of the radial artery which arises at the apex of the first intermetacarpal space. Two anatomical types were recorded according to the origin of the dorsoradial artery: type I (84% of cases), the vessel arises directly from the radial artery; type II (16% of cases), it arises from a common trunk with the first dorsal intermetacarpal artery. Those anatomical findings does not influence the flap operative technique, the flap design and the location of the pedicle pivot point. The dorsoradial artery emerges vertically from the apex of the first intermetacarpal space, crosses the angle between the extensor pollicis longus tendon laterally and the extensor carpi radialis longus tendon medially and turns proximally towards the distal radio-ulnar joint. Over the dorsal aspect of the wrist, the dorsoradial artery enters the subcutaneous tissue, runs parallel to the extensor pollicis longus tendon at three millimeters in a medial position, passes over the medial collateral branch of the superficial radial nerve and irrigates all the distal and dorsal quarter of the forearm. The artery is consistently accompanied by two comitantes veins, which assume the venous drainage of the cutaneous territory. The flap paddle is designed over the distal dorsal forearm quarter, between the dorsal crease of the wrist distally, the ulnar crest medially and the radial crest laterally. All this skin territory can be harvested and supplied by the dorsoradial pedicle, but we always should deal with the needs of the defects reconstruction and the morbidity of the donor site. The vascular pedicle is outlined between the distal radio-ulnar joint and the apex of the first intermetacarpal space with a minimum of one centimeter width. The surgical procedure is carried out under a tourniquet without an upper arm exsanguination. The skin is firstly dissected over the vascular pedicle through an S shape incision; it is lifted on the dermo-hypodermis plan preserving all the superficial venous network with the pedicle. The flap is elevated from proximal to distal including the dorsal forearm fascia. Over the dorsal extensor retinaculum, the dissection is underwent close to it elevating all the subcutaneous tissues. The medial collateral branch of the superficial radial nerve should be identified and respected. At the distal border of the dorsal retinaculum, the extensor pollicis longus and the extensor carpi radialis longus tendons are identified and retracted. The pedicle dissection goes deeper between this two tendons towards the first web space. It takes all the areolar tissue around the pedicle in order to preserve the venous network of the cutaneous paddle. The donor site is closed primarily if the skin width does not exceed 3 cm or grafted secondarily. Its large rotational arc allows the cutaneous paddle to cover the dorsal hand and metacarpo-phalangeal long fingers defects, the dorsal aspect of the thumb and the first intermetacarpal space. It can also safely reach the palmar aspect of the wrist. We report four clinical cases where the dorsoradial flap was successfully applied. This preliminary clinical experience exhibits the vascular network reliability and the operative technique simplicity of this new cutaneous flap. We believe that it should be added to the armamentarium of the reconstructive hand surgeon and considered as a useful tool for soft tissue hand and thumb reconstruction defects.",Bakhach J; Sentucq-Rigal J; Mouton P; Boileau R; Panconi B; Guimberteau JC,,2006,Annales de chirurgie plastique et esthetique,Case Reports; English Abstract; Journal Article,

METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included all-comers undergoing PCI between January 2012 and December 2016. Complex PCI was defined as a procedure with ≥1 of the following characteristics: 3 vessels treated, ≥3 stents implanted, two-stent bifurcation intervention, total stent length >60 mm, PCI on a chronic total occlusion, saphenous vein graft, or left main, protected PCI, use of rotational/laser atherectomy. CIN was defined as an increase in post-PCI creatinine of ≥0.3 mg/dl or ≥50% from baseline. RESULTS: We included 2660 patients (n = 1128 complex PCI, n = 1532 non-complex PCI). Complex PCI patients tended to be older, and had higher cardiovascular comorbidity and Mehran CIN risk score. They also had a higher prevalence of type B2/C lesions and need for mechanical circulatory support, and received a higher mean contrast volume (284 ± 137 vs. 189 ± 90 ml, p < 0.001). CIN incidence was similar in complex vs. non-complex PCI patients (12.1% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.63), as was the need for in-hospital dialysis (0.5% vs. 0.2%, p = 0.25). Upon multivariable adjustment, age, female sex, diabetes, ejection fraction, periprocedural hypotension, presentation with acute coronary syndrome, and contrast volume were independently associated with CIN, while complex PCI was not. CONCLUSIONS: Complex PCI is not associated with an increased risk of CIN in all-comers. Further studies should confirm our findings and investigate novel effective strategies to decrease the risk of this serious complication.",Azzalini L; Poletti E; Lombardo F; Laricchia A; Beneduce A; Moscardelli S; Bellini B; Maccagni D; Cappelletti A; Ancona MB; Carlino M; Chieffo A; Colombo A; Montorfano M,CHIP; Complex PCI; Contrast-induced acute kidney injury; Contrast-induced nephropathy,2019,International journal of cardiology,Journal Article,
2D,33428778,"3D-printed, patient-specific intracranial aneurysm models: From clinical data to flow experiments with endovascular devices.","PURPOSE: Flow models of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) can be used to test new and existing endovascular treatments with flow modulation devices (FMDs). Additionally, 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers the ability to measure hemodynamics. This way, the effect of FMDs can be determined noninvasively and compared to patient data. Here, we describe a cost-effective method for producing flow models to test the efficiency of FMDs with 4D flow MRI. METHODS: The models were based on human radiological data (internal carotid and basilar arteries) and printed in 3D with stereolithography. The models were printed with three different printing layers (25, 50, and 100 µm thickness). To evaluate the models in vitro, 3D rotational angiography, time-of-flight MRI, and 4D flow MRI were employed. The flow and geometry of one model were compared with in vivo data. Two FMDs (FMD1 and FMD2) were deployed into two different IA models, and the effect on the flow was estimated by 4D flow MRI. RESULTS: Models printed with different layer thicknesses exhibited similar flow and little geometric variation. The mean spatial difference between the vessel geometry measured in vivo and in vitro was 0.7 ± 1.1 mm. The main flow features, such as vortices in the IAs, were reproduced. The velocities in the aneurysms were similar in vivo and in vitro (mean velocity magnitude: 5.4 ± 7.6 and 7.7 ± 8.6 cm/s, maximum velocity magnitude: 72.5 and 55.1 cm/s). By deploying FMDs, the mean velocity was reduced in the IAs (from 8.3 ± 10 to 4.3 ± 9.32 cm/s for FMD1 and 9.9 ± 12.1 to 2.1 ± 5.6 cm/s for FMD2). CONCLUSIONS: The presented method allows to produce neurovascular models in approx. 15 to 30 h. The resulting models were found to be geometrically accurate, reproducing the main flow patterns, and suitable for implanting FMDs as well as 4D flow MRI. of American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Pravdivtseva MS; Peschke E; Lindner T; Wodarg F; Hensler J; Gabbert D; Voges I; Berg P; Barker AJ; Jansen O; Hövener JB,3D printing; 4D flow MRI; flow diverter stent; intracranial aneurysm; vascular models flow modulation device,2021,Medical physics,Journal Article,GRK2154/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)/; BE 6230/2-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)/; PMI1267/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)/; I 117/Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF)/
2D,24035418,Image guidance for endovascular repair of complex aortic aneurysms: comparison of two-dimensional and three-dimensional angiography and image fusion.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of image fusion (IF) of preprocedural arterial-phase computed tomography with intraprocedural fluoroscopy for roadmapping in endovascular repair of complex aortic aneurysms, and to compare this approach versus current roadmapping methods (ie, two-dimensional [2D] and three-dimensional [3D] angiography). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven consecutive patients with complex aortic aneurysms treated with endovascular techniques were retrospectively reviewed; these included aneurysms of digestive and/or renal arteries and pararenal and juxtarenal aortic aneurysms. All interventions were performed with the same angiographic system. According to the availability of different roadmapping software, patients were successively placed into three intraprocedural image guidance groups: (i) 2D angiography (n = 9), (ii) 3D rotational angiography (n = 14), and (iii) IF (n = 14). X-ray exposure (dose-area product [DAP]), injected contrast medium volume, and procedure time were recorded. RESULTS: Patient characteristics were similar among groups, with no statistically significant differences (P ≥ .05). There was no statistical difference in endograft deployment success between groups (2D angiography, eight of nine patients [89%]; 3D angiography and IF, 14 of 14 patients each [100%]). The IF group showed significant reduction (P < .0001) in injected contrast medium volume versus other groups (2D, 235 mL ± 145; 3D, 225 mL ± 119; IF, 65 mL ± 28). Mean DAP values showed no significant difference between groups (2D, 1,188 Gy · cm(2) ± 1,067; 3D, 984 Gy · cm(2) ± 581; IF, 655 Gy · cm(2) ± 457; P = .18); nor did procedure times (2D, 233 min ± 123; 3D, 181 min ± 53; IF, 189 min ± 60; P = .59). CONCLUSIONS: The use of IF-based roadmapping is a feasible technique for endovascular complex aneurysm repair associated with significant reduction of injected contrast agent volume and similar x-ray exposure and procedure time.",Tacher V; Lin M; Desgranges P; Deux JF; Grünhagen T; Becquemin JP; Luciani A; Rahmouni A; Kobeiter H,2D; 3D; DAP; DSA; EVAR; FOV; IF; digital subtraction angiography; dose–area product; endovascular aneurysm repair; field of view; image fusion; three-dimensional; two-dimensional,2013,Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,"Comparative Study; Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",R01 CA160771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States; R01CA160771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States
2D,37300396,Cardiac Pulsatile Helical Deformation of the Thoracic Aorta Before and After Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair of Type B Dissections.,"PURPOSE: Type B aortic dissections propagate with either achiral (nonspiraling) or right-handed chiral (spiraling) morphology, have mobile dissection flaps, and are often treated with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). We aim to quantify cardiac-induced helical deformation of the true lumen of type B aortic dissections before and after TEVAR. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective cardiac-gated computed tomography (CT) images before and after TEVAR of type B aortic dissections were used to construct systolic and diastolic 3-dimensional (3D) surface models, including true lumen, whole lumen (true+false lumens), and branch vessels. This was followed by extraction of true lumen helicity (helical angle, twist, and radius) and cross-sectional (area, circumference, and minor/major diameter ratio) metrics. Deformations between systole and diastole were quantified, and deformations between pre- and post-TEVAR were compared. RESULTS: Eleven TEVAR patients (59.9±4.6 years) were included in this study. Pre-TEVAR, there were no significant cardiac-induced deformations of helical metrics; however, post-TEVAR, significant deformation was observed for the true lumen proximal angular position. Pre-TEVAR, cardiac-induced deformations of all cross-sectional metrics were significant; however, only area and circumference deformations remained significant post-TEVAR. There were no significant differences of pulsatile deformation from pre- to post-TEVAR. Variance of proximal angular position and cross-sectional circumference deformation decreased after TEVAR. CONCLUSION: Pre-TEVAR, type B aortic dissections did not exhibit significant helical cardiac-induced deformation, indicating that the true and false lumens move in unison (do not move with respect to each other). Post-TEVAR, true lumens exhibited significant cardiac-induced deformation of proximal angular position, suggesting that exclusion of the false lumen leads to greater rotational deformations of the true lumen and lack of true lumen major/minor deformation post-TEVAR means that the endograft promotes static circularity. Population variance of deformations is muted after TEVAR, and dissection acuity influences pulsatile deformation while pre-TEVAR chirality does not. CLINICAL IMPACT: Description of thoracic aortic dissection helical morphology and dynamics, and understanding the impact of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) on dissection helicity, are important for improving endovascular treatment. These findings provide nuance to the complex shape and motion of the true and false lumens, enabling clinicians to better stratify dissection disease. The impact of TEVAR on dissection helicity provides a description of how treatment alters morphology and motion, and may provide clues for treatment durability. Finally, the helical component to endograft deformation is important to form comprehensive boundary conditions for testing and developing new endovascular devices.",Bondesson J; Suh GY; Dake MD; Lee JT; Cheng CP,TEVAR; helical angle; helical radius; helical twist; thoracic aorta; true lumen; type B aortic dissection,2023,Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International,Journal Article,
2D,11001484,Unbiased and efficient estimation of left ventricular volumes by three-dimensional echocardiography with coaxial sections. Validation with magnetic resonance imaging.,"The objective of this study was to investigate the degree of bias with coaxial three-dimensional echocardiography in an experimental animal setup and to establish the minimum number of sections needed for estimation of left ventricular (LV) volume. Epicardial coaxial echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure LV volume in 14 pigs, with chronic remodeled left ventricles induced by repeated intracoronary microembolizations. In addition, six animals underwent serial MRI at baseline, immediately after intracoronary microembolization, and after 119-165 days (mean 129 days). Coaxial echocardiography was performed by rotational acquisition of long-axis sections starting from an arbitrary angle. Planimetered MRI contours of LV endocardial borders were analyzed to investigate the relationship between the number of coaxial sections, and the precision of volume estimates. The mean +/- 2SD of the differences between coaxial epicardial echocardiography with six sections and MRI were -2.5 +/- 16.4 ml, 0.8 +/- 13.1 ml, and 2% +/- 14% for end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), and ejection fraction (EF), respectively. Numerical analysis conducted on MRI contours of LV endocardial borders showed that with six coaxial sections the average coefficient of error was < 1% for the EDV and ESV. Three-dimensional echocardiography with six coaxial sections provides unbiased LV volume estimation with minimal geometric error.",Kim WY; Terp KA; Nyengaard JR; Silkjaer T; Jensen FT,,2000,Heart and vessels,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,27039002,Detection of Cardiac Incidental Findings on Routine Chest CT: The Impact of Dedicated Training in Cardiac Imaging.,"PURPOSE: Routine chest CT and cardiac CT angiography (CTA) both image the heart, albeit with different precision and intent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic ability of radiologists with different levels of cardiac training to identify cardiac findings on chest CT without electrocardiographic gating compared with a reference standard of electrocardiographically gated cardiac CTA. METHODS: Electrocardiographically gated cardiac CT angiographic studies performed between January 2005 to January 2010 in patients with routine chest CT within six months were retrospectively identified. Fourteen radiologists at four stages of training (stage 1, residents with no cardiac training [n = 4]; stage 2, residents who had completed at least one dedicated rotation of cardiac imaging [n = 3]; stage 3, radiologists without cardiac training [n = 3]; and stage 4, radiologists with formal cardiac fellowship training [n = 4]) performed blinded, anonymized cardiac readings of chest CT images. Findings were categorized (coronary arterial, noncoronary vessel, cardiac chamber, myocardial, pericardial, and valve findings) with cardiac CTA as a reference standard. RESULTS: Overall, 140 cardiac CT angiographic findings were reported in 63 of 77 patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of nongated CTA were 43.6%, 96.8%, 83.0%, 81.6%, and 81.8%, respectively, for all readers. Increasing training was associated with higher sensitivity (30.3%, 35.7%, 45.7%, and 61.2% from stages 1 to 4) but similar specificity (96.4%, 96.7%, 96.3%, and 97.6% from stages 1 to 4). Frequently missed findings categories were coronary arterial, myocardial, and cardiac chamber findings. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing cardiac imaging training correlates with increased sensitivity and stable specificity to detect cardiac findings on routine chest CT without electrocardiographic gating. Cardiac findings should be noted on chest CT when observed, and cardiac training should be encouraged. rights reserved.",Verdini D; Lee AM; Prabhakar AM; Abbara S; Ghoshhajra B,ECG gated CT; Incidental findings; cardiac CTA; chest CT; coronary artery,2018,Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR,Journal Article,
2D,23897342,Free-style local perforator flaps: versatility of the v-y design to reconstruct soft-tissue defects in the skin cancer population.,"BACKGROUND: Free-style local perforator flaps can be harvested from any region of the body where an appropriate and detectable perforator vessel is present. Their use allows the surgeon to perform a ""like with like"" reconstruction by mobilizing surrounding tissues on a consistent vascular source. The authors report their experience with V-Y free-style perforator flaps in reconstruction of soft-tissue defects subsequent to skin cancer excision. METHODS: Forty elective defects in different regions of the body were reconstructed with V-Y advancement local perforator flaps raised in a free-style fashion. There were 23 male patients and 17 female patients. Mean age at surgery was 63 years. All defects resulted from skin cancer ablation. Mean defect size was 5×3.7 cm. Mean flap dimensions were 8.8×4.2 cm. The flaps were based on one (n=10), two (n=18), or three (n=12) perforators. RESULTS: Mean operative time was 93 minutes. Thirty-seven flaps (92.5 percent) healed uneventfully. In three flaps (7.5 percent), moderate venous insufficiency occurred, leading to partial flap necrosis that required surgical revision. In three cases (7.5 percent), the flap was converted to a rotation/hatchet perforator-based peninsular flap. Slight venous stasis was the most common postoperative finding registered (eight flaps; 20 percent). All flaps achieved adequate and durable reconstruction with excellent contour, with a follow-up ranging between 6 months and 2 years. CONCLUSION: Free-style local perforator flaps advanced in V-Y fashion proved to be a valid and reliable solution to restore function and aesthetics of the operated site after skin cancer excision.

2D,19308381,The position of the duodenojejunal junction: the wrong horse to bet on in diagnosing or excluding malrotation.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this communication is to highlight the shortcomings of all currently used imaging criteria in diagnosing or excluding malrotation and offer ultrasound demonstration of the 3(rd) portion of the duodenum (D3) between the AO and the SMA in transverse and sagittal plains as the most reliable diagnostic method. BACKGROUND: Although UGI is currently considered to be the imaging modality of choice in diagnosis of malrotations, numerous publications indicate that in certain patients, false positives and negatives can be encountered. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The material consists of more than 10 years experience in university settings, during which the author has used US as the definitive imaging modality for the work-up of malrotation. High resolution linear transducers (5-17 MHz) are the transducers of choice. Imaging plains: A. Transverse. With gradual grading compression, the following landmarks are illustrated in cehaplocaudad directions in the following order. The junction of splenic vein with the SMV portal vein. The cross sections of SMA and SMV that may either be situated in midline, or to the right or the left of the midline. Left renal vein crossing the spine from left to right between the AO and the SMA. The jejunal vein, often coming from left, transversing between the AO and the SMA. The transverse portion of the duodenum, D3, between the AO & the SMA. B. Sagittal. D3 between vertically oriented SMA-SMV and the AO. If SMA is not aligned with the AO by slight compression on the right or the left side of the abdomen, it will be aligned (depending on leftward or rightward position of SMA-SMV in axial plain). Vertical orientation of SMA and SMV if they have an anteroposterior orientation. C. Coronal. Side by side orientation of SMA and SMV if they don't have an anteroposterior orientation. RESULTS: In overwhelming majority of cases, by illustrating a retromesenteric D3 malrotation and, therefore, midgut volvulus were excluded. DISCUSSION: None of the current imaging criteria addresses the following most fundamental anatomic and embryologic facts regarding the gut rotation and fixation. In first trimester, the D3 is secured in retroperitoneal space after the embryologic journey comes to an end, making the duodenum immune of midgut volvulus. The surgical pathology of malrotation-midgut volvulus indicates that D3 is always Intraperitoneal and has not reached its final embryologic destination in retroperitoneal space. Demonstrating a retromesenteric D3, therefore, indicates that the embryologic journey is completed and the patient does not have malrotation. Excluding malrotation excludes the likelihood of midgut volvus. CONCLUSION: The position of the DJJ, the configuration of the duodenal sweep, the orientation of the mesenteric vessels are all wrong horses to bet on because none of them addresses the fundamental anatomic and embryologic facts. Only the cross-sectional imaging, US, CT and MRI can prove that the D3 is retromesenteric, therefore, excluding malrotation and volvulus. Therefore, demonstrating a retromesenteric duodenum is the reference standard of imaging in the work-up of malrotation, not any other previously published criteria. The US imaging is the most acceptable imaging method for malrotation work-up, in the spirit of ALARA principle and ""Image Gently"" campaign.",Yousefzadeh DK,,2009,Pediatric radiology,Journal Article; Review,
2D,28385882,Understanding Angiography-Based Aneurysm Flow Fields through Comparison with Computational Fluid Dynamics.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hemodynamics is thought to be an important factor for aneurysm progression and rupture. Our aim was to evaluate whether flow fields reconstructed from dynamic angiography data can be used to realistically represent the main flow structures in intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DSA-based flow reconstructions, obtained during interventional treatment, were compared qualitatively with flow fields obtained from patient-specific computational fluid dynamics models and quantitatively with projections of the computational fluid dynamics fields (by computing a directional similarity of the vector fields) in 15 cerebral aneurysms. RESULTS: The average similarity between the DSA and the projected computational fluid dynamics flow fields was 78% in the parent artery, while it was only 30% in the aneurysm region. Qualitatively, both the DSA and projected computational fluid dynamics flow fields captured the location of the inflow jet, the main vortex structure, the intrasaccular flow split, and the main rotation direction in approximately 60% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors affect the reconstruction of 2D flow fields from dynamic angiography sequences. The most important factors are the 3-dimensionality of the intrasaccular flow patterns and inflow jets, the alignment of the main vortex structure with the line of sight, the overlapping of surrounding vessels, and possibly frame rate undersampling. Flow visualization with DSA from >1 projection is required for understanding of the 3D intrasaccular flow patterns. Although these DSA-based flow quantification techniques do not capture swirling or secondary flows in the parent artery, they still provide a good representation of the mean axial flow and the corresponding flow rate.",Cebral JR; Mut F; Chung BJ; Spelle L; Moret J; van Nijnatten F; Ruijters D,,2017,AJNR.

2D,26420742,Construction and validation of a scale of assessment of self-care behaviours anticipatory to creation of arteriovenous fistula.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: We developed a scale to assess the self-care behaviours developed by patients with end-stage renal disease to preserve the vascular network prior to construction of arteriovenous fistula. BACKGROUND: The possibility of creation of an arteriovenous fistula depends on the existence of an arterial and venous network in good condition, namely the size and elasticity of the vessels. It is essential to teach the person to develop self-care behaviours for the preservation of the vascular network, regardless of the modality of dialysis selected. DESIGN: Methodological study. METHODS: The scale was developed based on clinical experience and research conducted by the researcher in the area of the vascular access for haemodialysis. The content of the scale was judged by two panels of experts for content validity. The revised version of the scale was administered to a convenience sample of 90 patients with end-stage renal disease. In the statistical analysis, we used the Cronbach's alpha, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin and scree plot and the principal component analysis with varimax rotation. RESULTS: A principal component analysis confirmed the univariate structure of the scale (KMO = 0·759, Bartlett's sphericity test-approximate χ(2) 142·201, p < 0·000). Cronbach's α is 0·831, varying between 0·711-0·879. CONCLUSION: This scale revealed properties that allow its use to assess the patients self-care behaviours regarding the preservation of the vascular network. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This scale can be used to evaluate educational programmes for the development of self-care behaviours in the preservation of vascular network. This scale can identify not only the patients that are able to take care of their vascular network but also the proportion of patients who are not able to do it, that need to be educated.",Sousa CN; Figueiredo MH; Dias VF; Teles P; Apóstolo JL,arteriovenous fistula; haemodialysis; scale; self-care; vascular access,2015,Journal of clinical nursing,Journal Article,
2D,15096930,Reconstruction of complex oncologic chest wall defects: a 10-year experience.,"The repair of complex chest wall defects presents a challenging problem for the reconstructive surgeon. Although the majority of such defects could be repaired with the use of local and regional musculocutaneous flaps, more complicated cases require increasingly sophisticated reconstructive techniques. This study reviews the experience at a single cancer center with chest wall reconstruction over a decade. A retrospective review was undertaken for each patient who underwent chest wall reconstruction from 1992 to 2002. Patient demographics and variables, including pathologic diagnosis, extent of resection, size of defect, method of reconstruction, and outcome were evaluated. There was a total of 113 patients, 88 females and 25 males. The average age was 58 years (range, 19-88 years). The most common diagnoses were breast cancer and sarcoma. The average area of the chest wall defect after resection was 266 cm. One hundred fifty-seven musculocutaneous or muscle flaps were performed for reconstruction of the chest wall. Eleven percent of patients underwent reconstruction with autologous free tissue transfer. One hundred six patients underwent a single operation. Seven patients required a second operation for salvage of a complication. In 19 cases (15%), more than 1 flap was used simultaneously to complete the reconstruction. Eighty-four percent of the patients achieved stable chest wall reconstruction with no complications. Seven patients (4%) had partial (>10%) flap loss. The most common remaining postoperative complications were delayed wound healing (3% of patients), infection (2.5%), and hematoma (2.5%). Immediate chest wall reconstruction is safe, reliable, and can most often be accomplished with 1 operation. A variety of flaps, both single and in combination, could be used to achieve definitive coverage of the chest wall after extirpative surgery. The reconstructive choice is dependent on factors such as size of the defect, location on the chest wall, arc of rotation of the flap, and availability of recipient vessels. Based on this single institutional experience over a decade, an algorithm to chest wall reconstruction is provided.",Chang RR; Mehrara BJ; Hu QY; Disa JJ; Cordeiro PG,,2004,Annals of plastic surgery,Journal Article,
2D,12130452,Standard-dose and 50%-reduced-dose chest CT: comparing the effect on image quality.,"OBJECTIVE: CT accounts for considerable population-based radiation dose from radiographic diagnostic studies. The technical factors for CT examinations are not appropriately adjusted on the basis of patient size and anatomy. We hypothesized that radiation doses for routine chest CT can be reduced by 50% for the evaluation of normal structures without seriously jeopardizing image quality. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After receiving institutional review board approval, we prospectively studied 24 patients with cancer who were 65 years old and older on a multidetector CT scanner. Each patient underwent imaging with four slices (centered at the carina) at the standard dose (220-280 mAs) and at 50%-reduced dose (110-140 mAs) at a constant 140 kVp. Single breath-hold scanning was performed with a 2.5-mm detector configuration, a tube rotation time of 0.8 sec, and a pitch of 6:1. Contiguous images were reconstructed at 5-mm intervals. Two subspecialty-trained chest radiologists who were unaware of the CT technique reviewed randomized images for overall image quality and anatomic detail of the structures in the lung, airway, mediastinum, and chest wall using a 5-point scale (1, worst; 2, suboptimal; 3, adequate; 4, very good; 5, excellent). The data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon's signed rank test. RESULTS: Although overall image quality was better with standard-dose CT, the quality of reduced-dose CT was acceptable. The differences in mean scores were statistically significant. There was a correlation of 0.59 between observers. The mean scores of standard-dose CT were always greater than or equivalent to those of low-dose CT for both observers. The assessment of great vessels and soft tissue of the chest wall contributed mainly to the differences in image quality. Both the central and peripheral lung parenchyma and the airway were adequately visualized on low-dose CT. Radiation doses (based on weighted-CT-dose index) from standard-dose CT and 50%-reduced-dose CT were 15.6-21.4 mSv and 7.8-10.7 mSv, respectively (from the manufacturer's data). CONCLUSION: Chest CT image quality appears to be acceptable for evaluating normal anatomic structures even with a 50% reduction in radiation dose.",Prasad SR; Wittram C; Shepard JA; McLoud T; Rhea J,,2002,AJR.

2D,36660810,Ticagrelor or prasugrel versus clopidogrel in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic coronary syndromes.,"BACKGROUND: Potent P2Y(12) inhibitors such as ticagrelor and prasugrel are superior to clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Whether this benefit extends to a patient population with chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) is unclear. AIMS: We sought to compare the safety and efficacy of prasugrel and ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in patients undergoing PCI for CCS. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing PCI for CCS at a tertiary centre between 2014 and 2019 who were discharged on prasugrel or ticagrelor were compared with those on clopidogrel. The primary endpoint was the composite of death and myocardial infarction (MI), with secondary outcomes including rates of bleeding, stroke, and target vessel revascularisation at 1 year. RESULTS: Overall, 11,508 patients were included in the study (ticagrelor/prasugrel n=2,860 [24.9%], clopidogrel n=8,648 [75.1%]) with an increasing frequency of potent P2Y(12) inhibitor use over the study period (p(trend)<0.001). Clopidogrel was used more frequently in patients with multimorbid risk factors, whereas anatomical or procedural complexity was associated with ticagrelor/prasugrel use (left main PCI, bifurcation PCI, number of lesions, rotational atherectomy). No difference in the incidence of death or MI was noted across the groups (ticagrelor/prasugrel vs clopidogrel: 2.7% vs 3.1%, adjusted hazard ratio [adjHR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-1.17; p=0.33) or secondary outcomes including bleeding (adjHR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.46-1.21; p=0.23) on propensity score stratification analysis. Additionally, no difference in the primary outcome was observed across subgroups, including those undergoing complex PCI. CONCLUSIONS: Ticagrelor and prasugrel are increasingly used in patients with CCS undergoing PCI with similar 1-year efficacy and safety when compared to clopidogrel. Whether use of these agents can be beneficial in patients undergoing PCI for CCS with a high thrombotic and low bleeding risk warrants further study.",Koshy AN; Giustino G; Sartori S; Hooda A; Feng Y; Snyder C; Dasgupta S; Kumar KR; Krishnamoorthy-Melarcode P; Sweeny J; Khera S; Serrao GW; Sharma R; Dangas G; Kini AS; Mehran R; Sharma SK,,2023,EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on,Journal Article,
2D,16530639,Extracranial carotid MR imaging at 3T.,"Some controversy exists over the accuracy and optimal parameters for carotid CE MR angiography at 1.5T. Spatial resolution remains more important than does temporal resolution to address the key question of vessel stenosis, based upon a review of the available literature that compares CE MR angiography with DSA. Specifically, CE MR angiograms with 0.9- to 1.2-mm resolution in all three planes before interpolation have a high reported sensitivity and specificity compared with DSA. To achieve this type of spatial resolution, cover the entire course of the carotid arteries from the aortic arch through the skull base, and achieve an absence of venous signal usually requires an elliptic-centric phase encoding CE MR angiogram that lasts for 50 to 60 seconds without the use of parallel imaging techniques. This near-millimeter resolution requires an accurate timing of the gadolinium bolus arrival to maximize intra-arterial SNR and to minimize venous contamination. Parallel imaging techniques can decrease the imaging time, but at a cost of some SNR. Initial experience with eight-channel or higher neurovascular coils at 3T indicates an increase in SNR/CNR compared with 1.5T. This should allow more consistent submillimeter-resolution carotid CE MR angiography with adequate SNR to maintain good IQ in a wide variety of clinical patients. Although a definite, prospective comparison of various CE MR angiography techniques,including a 20- to 30-second scan with 1.2- to 1.4-mm(3) voxel resolution and 50- to 60-second scan with 0.9- to 1.1-mm(3) voxel resolution at 1.5T, as well as 0.5- to 0.6-mm(3) voxel resolution with scan time of 50 to 60 seconds at 3T versus rotational DSA does not exist, the expectation is that the higher resolution and increased SNR that has resulted from 3T carotid CE MR angiography will have high sensitivity and specificity in detecting severe carotid stenosis. The most exciting application of 3T for carotid artery imaging may not be the higher resolution CE MR angiogram, however. Early work has demonstrated the potential of 3T, combined with sensitive surface coils, to depict carotid plaque with sufficient SNR to identify important plaque components consistently in most patients. This could help move MR imaging of the carotid arteries away from a strict evaluation of luminal narrowing to a focused evaluation of plaque morphology. Much work needs to be done. Although there is a growing body of literature to support the contention that plaque morphology is a predictor of subsequent thrombo-embolic disease, the natural history of these various plaque components in a large number of patients needs to be elucidated. If plaque characterization proves to be an independent risk factor that predicts stroke, more aggressive clinical treatment option strategies may be devised for patients who are at the highest risk. Currently, plaque characterization at 3T requires a different set of coils compared with the global assessment of the entire course of the carotid arteries. Future generations of 16- to 32-channel carotid coils should be able to combine the best features of current 4- to 8-channel surface carotid coils and neurovascular coils. These will enable a comprehensive evaluation of the entire course of the carotid artery and detailed carotid bifurcation plaque characterization at 3T within a clinically acceptable 1-hour time frame. This comprehensive carotid artery evaluation with 3T MR imaging would be far superior to that which is possible with US or CT.",DeMarco JK; Huston J 3rd; Nash AK,,2006,Magnetic resonance imaging clinics of North America,Journal Article; Review,
2D,37337462,Periprocedural myocardial infarction in patients undergoing complex versus noncomplex percutaneous coronary intervention.,"BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on the risk of periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) in patients undergoing complex versus noncomplex percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: We assessed the risk of periprocedural MI according to the fourth Universal definition of myocardial infarction (UDMI) and several other criteria among patients undergoing elective PCI in a prospective, single-center registry. Complex PCI included at least one of the following: 3 coronary vessels treated, ≥3 stents implanted, ≥3 lesions treated, bifurcation with 2 stents implanted, total stent length >60 mm, treatment of chronic total occlusion, and use of rotational atherectomy. RESULTS: Between 2017 and 2021, we included 1010 patients with chronic coronary syndrome, of whom 226 underwent complex PCI (22.4%). The rate of periprocedural MI according to the fourth UDMI was significantly higher in complex compared to noncomplex PCI patients (26.5% vs. 14.5%, p < 0.001). Additionally, periprocedural MI was higher in the complex PCI group using SCAI (4% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.009), ARC-2 (13.7% vs. 8.0%, p = 0.013), ISCHEMIA (5.8% vs. 1.7%, p = 0.002), and EXCEL criteria (4.9% vs. 2.0%, p = 0.032). SYNTAX periprocedural MI occurred at low rates in both groups (0.9% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.657). Complex PCI was an independent predictor of the fourth UDMI periprocedural MI (odds ratio [OR] 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-2.27, p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic coronary syndrome undergoing elective PCI, complex PCI is associated with a significantly higher risk of periprocedural MI using multiple definitions. These findings highlight the importance of considering upfront this risk in the planning of complex PCI procedures.

2D,11316482,"Geometric visual hallucinations, Euclidean symmetry and the functional architecture of striate cortex.","This paper is concerned with a striking visual experience: that of seeing geometric visual hallucinations. Hallucinatory images were classified by Klüver into four groups called form constants comprising (i) gratings, lattices, fretworks, filigrees, honeycombs and chequer-boards, (ii) cobwebs, (iii) tunnels, funnels, alleys, cones and vessels, and (iv) spirals. This paper describes a mathematical investigation of their origin based on the assumption that the patterns of connection between retina and striate cortex (henceforth referred to as V1)-the retinocortical map-and of neuronal circuits in V1, both local and lateral, determine their geometry. In the first part of the paper we show that form constants, when viewed in V1 coordinates, essentially correspond to combinations of plane waves, the wavelengths of which are integral multiples of the width of a human Hubel-Wiesel hypercolumn, ca. 1.33-2 mm. We next introduce a mathematical description of the large-scale dynamics of V1 in terms of the continuum limit of a lattice of interconnected hypercolumns, each of which itself comprises a number of interconnected iso-orientation columns. We then show that the patterns of interconnection in V1 exhibit a very interesting symmetry, i.e. they are invariant under the action of the planar Euclidean group E(2)-the group of rigid motions in the plane-rotations, reflections and translations. What is novel is that the lateral connectivity of V1 is such that a new group action is needed to represent its properties: by virtue of its anisotropy it is invariant with respect to certain shifts and twists of the plane. It is this shift-twist invariance that generates new representations of E(2). Assuming that the strength of lateral connections is weak compared with that of local connections, we next calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the cortical dynamics, using Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory. The result is that in the absence of lateral connections, the eigenfunctions are degenerate, comprising both even and odd combinations of sinusoids in straight phi, the cortical label for orientation preference, and plane waves in r, the cortical position coordinate. 'Switching-on' the lateral interactions breaks the degeneracy and either even or else odd eigenfunctions are selected. These results can be shown to follow directly from the Euclidean symmetry we have imposed. In the second part of the paper we study the nature of various even and odd combinations of eigenfunctions or planforms, the symmetries of which are such that they remain invariant under the particular action of E(2) we have imposed. These symmetries correspond to certain subgroups of E(2), the so-called axial subgroups. Axial subgroups are important in that the equivariant branching lemma indicates that when a symmetrical dynamical system becomes unstable, new solutions emerge which have symmetries corresponding to the axial subgroups of the underlying symmetry group. This is precisely the case studied in this paper. Thus we study the various planforms that emerge when our model V1 dynamics become unstable under the presumed action of hallucinogens or flickering lights. We show that the planforms correspond to the axial subgroups of E(2), under the shift-twist action. We then compute what such planforms would look like in the visual field, given an extension of the retinocortical map to include its action on local edges and contours. What is most interesting is that, given our interpretation of the correspondence between V1 planforms and perceived patterns, the set of planforms generates representatives of all the form constants. It is also noteworthy that the planforms derived from our continuum model naturally divide V1 into what are called linear regions, in which the pattern has a near constant orientation, reminiscent of the iso-orientation patches constructed via optical imaging. The boundaries of such regions form fractures whose points of intersection correspond to the well-known 'pinwheels'. To complete the study we then investigate the stability of the planforms, using methods of nonlinear stability analysis, including Liapunov-Schmidt reduction and Poincaré-Lindstedt perturbation theory. We find a close correspondence between stable planforms and form constants. The results are sensitive to the detailed specification of the lateral connectivity and suggest an interesting possibility, that the cortical mechanisms by which geometric visual hallucinations are generated, if sited mainly in V1, are closely related to those involved in the processing of edges and contours.",Bressloff PC; Cowan JD; Golubitsky M; Thomas PJ; Wiener MC,,2001,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

2D,18993003,Dual-source CT coronary angiography in patients with atrial fibrillation: comparison with single-source CT.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) for the visualization of the coronary arteries in a population with atrial fibrillation (AF) compared to single-source CT (SSCT) and to explore the impact of patients' heart rate (HR) on image quality (IQ) and reconstruction timing. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients (11 male, 19 female; 69.0+/-9.2 years old) with suspected coronary artery disease and permanent AF were examined on a DSCT scanner (120 kV, 400 mAs/rot, 0.33 s rotation time, 64 x 0.6 mm collimation, pitch 0.20-0.28, Siemens Somatom Definition). Patients were divided into two groups: low and medium HR group (HR<or=80 bpm, n=14) and high HR group (HR>80 bpm, n=16). Five of the patients also underwent conventional coronary angiography (CAG). The raw data from both tube detector arrays were reconstructed as DSCT data using a routine algorithm (temporal resolution of 83 ms). The raw data from one tube detector array was reconstructed separately on the same system using a routine single source algorithm (temporal resolution of 83-165 ms) and defined as virtual SSCT data. Image quality was assessed using a four-point grading scale from excellent (1) to non-assessable (4). RESULTS: IQ of the DSCT data was significantly better than that of the virtual SSCT data (mean score 1.33+/-0.61 vs. 1.80+/-1.02; Z=-8.755, P=0.000). 98.6% of the segments shown in DSCT were diagnostic, compared with 89.9% of the segments in virtual SSCT, chi(2)=32.595, P=0.000. In DSCT group, IQ of low HR group was also better than that of high HR group, although the difference was not as big (mean score 1.25+/-0.52 vs. 1.38+/-0.66; Z=-2.227, P=0.026). The mean HR of low HR group and high HR group were 67.4+/-8.5 beats per minute (bpm) and 94.2+/-8.8 bpm (t=-8.499, P=0.000). The range of the variation of HR was higher in high HR group than in low HR group (mean difference between maximum and minimum HR 79.5+/-21.0 vs. 49.9+/-21.1 bpm; t=-3.845, P=0.001). In 23 (77%) patients optimal IQ was achieved within one phase for all three main arteries. In low HR group, the optimal phase was distributed evenly between diastole and systole; but in high HR group, the optimal phase shifted to systole in most cases (92%). In five cases these results were compared to CAG results to look for the ability to identify stenosis with a diameter reduction of more than 50% of the lumen. With DSCT it was possible to diagnose 20 of 21 stenosis and 48 of 49 non-stenosed vessel segments correctly. With SSCT 19 of 21 stenosis and 45 of 49 non-stenosed vessel segments were diagnosed correctly according to CAG. CONCLUSION: Due to its high temporal resolution, DSCT provides images of full diagnostic image quality in patients with AF, which otherwise would be excluded from CT examinations. The number of assessable segments for DSCT is still somewhat less than in non-AF patients, but in opposition to SSCT still valid for routine diagnostic imaging. Patients' HR had impact on IQ and reconstruction timing.",Wang Y; Zhang Z; Kong L; Song L; Merges RD; Chen J; Jin Z,,2008,European journal of radiology,Comparative Study; Evaluation Study; Journal Article,
2D,35729492,A randomised control trial protocol of MuST for vascular access cannulation in hemodialysis patients (MuST Study): contributions for a safe nursing intervention.,"BACKGROUND: The vascular access preservation and the maintenance of a complication-free fistula remains an Achilles' heel of hemodialysis in chronic kidney patients due to its substantial contribution to the morbidity and mortality. Systematic studies in the area of examining cannulation practices, achieving complication-free cannulation, and strategies to improve fistula survival are needed. For this reason, we consider it essential to create and investigate new methodologies for approaching fistula in patients on regular HD. The Multiple Single Cannulation Technique (MuST) is based on the association between the rope-ladder (RL) using the arteriovenous vessel through progressive rotation, and the buttonhole (BH) since there are three specific cannulation sites for each cannulation day during the week. The MuST is simple to implement and seems to be a very promising technique in terms of patient safety. Previous studies already showed an arteriovenous fistula survival similar to RL but significantly higher than BH. METHODS: This MuST study is a multicenter, prospective, non-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial with the intervention group submitted to MuST and a control group undergoing the rope-ladder, up to 100 subjects for each group. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to one of two cannulation technique (CT), and the follow-up period of this study will be 12 months. Primary outcome is to evaluate the arteriovenous fistula survival rate at 12 months determined by the percentage of fistulas in use from the beginning of the study to the date of the first clinical intervention by angioplasty or vascular surgery, to maintain or restore patency (unassisted patency). Secondary outcome is to evaluate arteriovenous fistula survival rate at 12 month determined by the percentage of fistulas in use from the study start to the date of access abandonment due to dysfunction, patient abandonment, or death, treatment change modality or study end. We will also evaluate the assisted primary patency and include the following secondary outcomes associated with the cannulation technique: Infection, Hematoma, Aneurysm development, and pain. DISCUSSION: The study will investigate whether fistula survival can be improved when using cannulation by MuST compared to the RL. MuST study will provide important information on fistula survival when cannulated by MuST but also information related to its use in fistulas previously cannulated by other CTs.

METHODS: Between June 2010 and January 2013, 12 patients with traumatic ulnar styloid impaction syndrome were treated by Sauvé-Kapandji procedure. There were 4 men and 8 women, with an average age of 58.9 years (range, 50-69 years). The disease was caused by traffic accident in 1 case, and by falling from height in 11 cases. All patients had dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint, and 7 patients also had old fractures of the distal radius. The main clinical symptoms were pain and limited activity of the wrist joint, and the disease duration was 2-4 months (mean, 3.5 months). The visual analogue scale (VAS) was 6.2±1.4. The clinical outcomes were assessed by VAS, range of motion (ROM) of the wrist, grip strength, Evans score, and X-ray film of wrist joint during follow-up. RESULTS: All patients obtained healing of incision by first intention and were followed up 37-73 months (mean, 58.4 months); no complication of infection, blood vessel injury, or nerves injury occurred. VAS was 1.2±1.0 at the final follow-up, showing significant difference when compared with preoperative one ( t=9.950, P=0.000). The ROM of the affected wrist joint in flexion, extension, ulnar deviation, forearm pronation and supination were improved, but the ROM of the affected side were significantly less than those of normal side ( P<0.05). No significant difference was found in the grip strength and Evans score between the affected side and normal side ( t=-0.885, P=0.386; t=-1.969, P=0.062). According to Evans scores, the results were excellent in 8 cases, good in 3 cases, and fair in 1 case, with an excellent and good rate of 91.7%. Postoperative radiographs showed bony healing in all patients, with the average healing time of 3.5 months (range, 3-6 months). The instability of proximal ulna occurred in 3 cases. CONCLUSION: Sauvé-Kapandji procedure is a reliable remedy method for traumatic ulnar styloid impaction syndrome, with favorable improvement in wrist pain and forearm rotation. However, the surgical indications for Sauvé-Kapandji procedure should be strictly controlled.",Wang J; Liu G; Huang F; Tang S; Zhang D; Wang L,Sauvé-Kapandji procedure; Ulnar styloid impaction syndrome; functional reconstruction; wrist,2017,Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi =,Journal Article,
2D,23342746,[Laparoscopic treatment of UPJ obstruction in ectopic pelvic kidneys in children].,"AIMS: To assess the feasibility and safety of a laparoscopic approach to UPJ obstruction (UPJO) in ectopic pelvic kidneys. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a retrospective analysis we selected 14 children, aged 6 months to 17 years, 12 males, 2 females, who had been treated in our Department between January 2004 and June 2011. 9 patients presented ureteropelvic junction obstruction (in 3 cases pelvic stones coexisted) with normal/moderately reduced (> or = 25%) relative function at radionuclide scan (MAG3), 3 nonfunctioning kidneys associated or not to hypertension, 2 congenital hypo-dysplastic kidneys. The evaluation of each patient involved the medical history, ultrasound examination, VCUG, MAG3 diuresis renogram and MRI in some cases. Of the patients presenting UPJO, 5 underwent dismembered pyeloplasty with pyelolithotomy, if required, and 4 pelvic derotation with straightening of the uretero-pelvic junction. A previous cystoscopic placement of a Double J stent was utilized. This facilitated the identification and dissection around the pelvis. With the patient in Trendelenburg position we utilized an umbilical trocar and two trocar in the right and left iliac fossae; an additional trocar, when required, was inserted more cephalad on the midclavear line contralaterally to the lesion. The derotation of ureteropelvic junction was obtained by freeing the kidney's lower pole and by placing intraperitoneally the junction protected with a Double J stent. This was obtained by suturing the peritoneum behind the ureteropelvic junction resulting in a forward rotation of the major axis of the kidney and a straightening of the junction. The 5 patients presenting nonfunctioning ectopic kidneys underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy. While the removal of congenital hypoplasic kidneys resulted easy, the removal of nonfunctioning kidneys was more difficult due to their complex vascular situation and for the embryonic disposition. RESULTS: The operating time varied between 40 to 200 minutes. No patient required conversion to open surgery. The hypertension resolved after nephrectomy in all cases. 2 cases of dismembered pyeloplasty required a placement of Double J stent due the recurrence of symptoms and ! patient is waiting for redo operation. The pelvic derotation showed an improvement of diuretic MAG3 renogram and the function remained stable and patiens are symptoms-free. CONCLUSION: The UPJO in ectopic pelvic kidneys presents a large spectrum of presentation. The laparoscopic approach provides good surgical exposure, and operative times are acceptable compared to those of laparoscopic procedure in anatomically normal kidneys. It has also proved a very useful tool in the non-functioning kidney nephrectomy thank to the help of magnification in the identification of numerous aberrant vessels that are quite often found in the pelvic kidneys. The derotation of the pelvis seems a useful procedure in moderate obstruction even if a longer followup is needed.",Marte A; Prezioso M; Pintozzi L; Cavaiuolo S; Coppola S; Borrelli M; Parmeggiani P,,2012,La Pediatria medica e chirurgica : Medical and surgical pediatrics,Journal Article,
2D,16357399,16-MDCT coronary angiography versus invasive coronary angiography in acute chest pain syndrome: a blinded prospective study.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to prospectively evaluate the usefulness of CT coronary angiography versus invasive coronary angiography for the detection of clinically significant coronary artery disease in patients hospitalized for acute chest pain syndrome. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six consecutive patients (52 men and 14 women; average age, 57 +/- 11 [SD] years) who were hospitalized for acute chest pain syndrome underwent CT coronary angiography and invasive coronary angiography within an average time interval of 4 days. ECG-gated CT coronary angiography was performed with a 16-MDCT scanner (0.42-sec rotation time, 16 x 0.75 mm detector collimation). Beta-blockers were not administered routinely, and thus the average heart rate was 71 +/- 11 beats per minute. CT coronary angiographic images were evaluated concurrently by two radiologists, who were blinded to invasive coronary angiography results, for stenoses having a diameter of 50% or more, using a 15-segment classification, including all segments 2 mm or more in diameter. The consensus interpretation was compared with results of invasive coronary angiography. RESULTS: CT coronary angiography was technically successful in 59 patients (89%). After exclusion of 20 (3.1%) of 649 coronary segments, which were classified as nonevaluable by CT coronary angiography, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of CT coronary angiography for identifying significant coronary artery disease in the remaining 629 coronary segments were 80% (68/85), 89% (482/544), 52% (68/130), 97% (482/499), and 87% (550/629), respectively. The overall accuracy for the main vessels (left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex, and right coronary arteries) was 93%, 88%, 86%, and 86%, respectively. CONCLUSION: CT coronary angiography using a 16-MDCT scanner enables accurate noninvasive detection of significant coronary artery disease in patients hospitalized for acute chest pain syndrome. Furthermore, relative high sensitivity and specificity of CT coronary angiography can be achieved without pharmacologic manipulation of patient heart rates.",Ghersin E; Litmanovich D; Dragu R; Rispler S; Lessick J; Ofer A; Brook OR; Gruberg L; Beyar R; Engel A,,2006,AJR.

2D,6774681,"[Diagnosis of limited septal infarction associated with a posterior or postero-inferior infarction. Value of vectorcardiography and clinical, coronary angiographic and developed correlations].","In patients with posterior or postero inferior infarction, a limited septal infarction may be detected by vectorcardiography, septal extension being a sign of disease of the left anterior descending artery. In order to confirm this hypothesis, 31 posterior or postero inferior infarction with septal extension were selected by vectorcardiography from more than 500 ECGs recorded after the acute phase of a clinically and biologically documented infarction. The following criteria were chosen: 1. Anterior deviation of the QRS, associated or not with superior deviation of the initial deflection lasting over 25 ms and clockwise rotation of the frontal loop (posterior infarct: 9 cases, postero inferior infarct: 22 cases). 2. Abnormalities of the initial phase of the QRS in the horizontal plane, associated with a reduced amplitude and duration of the initial deflection. The clinical, ECG, vectorcardiographic and angiographic (14 cases) features of these 31 postero septal infarcts were compared with those of 31 posterior septal infarcts were compared with those of 31 posterior or postero inferior infarcts (24 coronary angiographies). 1. From the clinicl point of view, in the acute phase postero septal infarction did not differ from posterior infarction and the early prognosis was favourable. On the other hand, with an average follow-up of 2 years, the outcome of postero septal infarction was statistically more complicated than that of strict posterior infarction (52 p. 100 compared to 19 p. 100, p < 0.01). 2. From the electrocardiographical point of view, septal extension of posterior infarction was only suspected in 25 p. 100 cases. In the acute phase, ST depression in V2 to V5 sometimes associated with reduction of the R wave in the right precordial leads and QS waves in V4R, suggesting a ""rudimentary"" or ""subendocardial"" infarct. 3. From the angiographic point of view, although disease of the posterior vessels was equally common in posterior and postero septal infarction (86 p. 100 compared to 92 p. 100 NS), stenosis of the left anterior descending artery was statistically more common in postero septal infarction than in posterior infarction (86 p.100 compared to 29 p. 100, p < 0.001). Thallium myocardial scintigraphy, when performed, showed the double myocardial lesion in the antero septal and postero inferior walls in postero septal infarction. These results validate the vectorcardiographical criteria retained for diagnosis of postero septal infarction and confirmed the superiority of the vectorcardiogramme over the electrocardiogramme in the diagnosis of double infarction. Therefore, the vectorcardiogramme in the diagnosis of double infarction. Therefore, the vectorcardiogramme allows selection of the patients with postero diaphragmatic infarction with a limited septal extension, for whom coronary angiography should be proposed. A ""postero septal"" infarct diagnosed on vectorcardiogramme has a high probability of stenosis of the left anterior descending artery.",Machecourt J; Denis B; Grosclaude G; Dimitriou R; Wolf JE; Pellet J; Martin-Noel P,,1980,Archives des maladies du coeur et des vaisseaux,English Abstract; Journal Article,
2D,8258434,[Biplane transesophageal echocardiography. Diagnostic improvement over the mono-plane technique].,"Monoplane transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a well established diagnostic tool of examination of great value in determining pathological changes in both atria, atrioventricular valves, the left-ventricular outflow tract, and in the thoracic aorta (Table 1). With the monoplane technique, however, it is never possible to obtain more than parallel, or oblique transverse views of the heart and surrounding vessels. The only means with which to examine anatomic structures in their cranio-caudal dimension by way of this method is to make a composite of a number of transverse sections. This makes three-dimensional interpretation of monoplane images difficult. The biplane transesophageal technique provides images of orthogonal sections to the transverse plane, allowing three-dimensional reconstruction and thus greatly improved insight into the cardial anatomy. By ante- or retroflection and lateral angulation of the probe, it becomes possible to see structures as a whole, the greatest dimension of which may not lie in the strictly sagittal section, but on a craniocaudal diagonal plane, e.g. the ascending aorta, or the aortic valve plane. The diagnostic gain of additional data through biplane TEE stems from its images of cardial structures, which remain either unsatisfactory or not attainable on monoplane examination (Table 2). Above all this pertains to the superior vena cava in its longitudinal extension (Figure 6), the right-ventricular outflow tract with pulmonary valve, the longitudinal two-chamber view (Figure 3), and the CW-Doppler analysis in presence of tricuspid valve regurgitation (Figure 13). Transversal visualization of the aortic arch is only feasible by using biplane imaging technique (Figure 12). Compared to the monoplane technique, it shows clearly more distinct views of the apex of the left ventricle (Figure 1), the atrial anatomy (Figures 5 and 6), and here in particular the pathology of interatrial septum (Figure 7), as well as the aortic valve and the ascending aorta (Figures 8, 10 and 11). By using the longitudinal imaging plane left atrial appendage can be seen without additional anteflection of the probe, thus, reducing stress to the patient during examination. The loss of an infinite range of planes available to the multiplane technique is a disadvantage, but this can usually be compensated by appropriate flecting of the probe and adequate simultaneous lateral angulation. The range of rotation of the probe in the multiplane method allows better three-dimensional imaging of anatomic structures and regurgitant jets than do the mono- and biplane techniques, and comparable data are often only attained under much longer examination with the biplane instrument.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Lambertz H; Menzel T; Stellwaag M,,1993,Herz,Journal Article,

The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of textile electrodes for ECG recording as a smart garment. Electrode textile pads and lead wires were sewn to the lining of sportswear and their tolerability to repeated washings were tested up to 150 times. The electrical conductivity of the textile electrode remained functional for up to 50 machine washes. To assess the level of motion artifacts or noise during the daily monitoring of ECG, a single lead ECG with conventional or textile electrodes was recorded during supine rest, seated rest, upright trunk rotation (i.e., twisting), and stepping movement in 66 healthy adults. A Holter system was used for data storage and analysis. ECG patterns of P, QRS, and T waves were comparable between the conventional and textile electrodes. However, the signal-to-artifact-and/or-noise ratio (SAR) during twisting was larger in the textile electrodes than in the conventional electrodes. No skin irritation was seen in the textile electrodes. The single lead textile electrodes embedded in an inner garment were usable for continuous and/or repeated ECG monitoring in daily life except during vigorous trunk movement.",Tsukada YT; Tokita M; Murata H; Hirasawa Y; Yodogawa K; Iwasaki YK; Asai K; Shimizu W; Kasai N; Nakashima H; Tsukada S,Holter monitoring; Reusable; Textile electrode; Washable; Wearable device,2019,Heart and vessels,Journal Article,
2D,38774022,Arthroscopic Reduction and Fixation of a Pipkin Type-I Femoral Head Fracture.,"BACKGROUND: This video article describes the technique for arthroscopic reduction and fixation of Pipkin type-I fractures. DESCRIPTION: Surgery is performed with the patient in a supine position, with free lower limbs, on a radiolucent table. Arthroscopic superior and anterolateral portals are made similarly to the portals created to evaluate the peripheral compartment during an outside-in (ballooning) technique.(1) An additional medial portal is subsequently created in order to aid in reduction and screw placement. The medial portal is created in abduction and external rotation of the hip (i.e., the figure-4 position). The adductor tendon is identified, and the portal is then safely positioned posteriorly to its margin, approximately 4 to 5 cm distal to the inguinal fold, avoiding the saphenous vein (usually identified with an ultrasound scan). The fragment is mobilized, debrided, and then reduced with use of a microfracture awl or a large Kirschner wire (used as a joystick). Following reduction, temporary fixation is performed with use of long Kirschner wires under direct visualization and fluoroscopic guidance. If reduction is satisfactory, definitive fixation can be performed with use of 4.5-mm headless screws through the medial portal. All steps of fragment reduction and fixation are performed through the medial portal, with the patient in the figure-4 position. Once the screws are placed, a final dynamic arthroscopic and fluoroscopic check is performed. ALTERNATIVES: In Pipkin type-I fractures, surgery is recommended when the femoral head fragment is large (exceeding 15% to 20% of the femoral head volume) and displaced (by >3 mm). In such cases, if untreated, spontaneous evolution to osteoarthritis may occur. For fragments smaller than 10% to 15% of the femoral head volume, arthroscopic removal is often the best choice(2). Several approaches (e.g., Smith-Petersen, modified Hueter, Kocher-Langenbeck, and surgical safe dislocation) have been proposed for reduction and fixation, with surgical safe dislocation being the most versatile because of the uniquely complete visualization of the femoral head(3). RATIONALE: The arthroscopic reduction and fixation technique for a non-comminuted Pipkin type-I fracture holds the intrinsic advantages of being less invasive than open surgery in terms of surgical exposure, and having less blood loss, infection risks, and wound complications. Arthroscopy allows direct visualization of the fragment and its reduction surface, along with removal of articular loose bodies and debridement. The surgical time is influenced by the surgeon's experience, but often is no longer than with an open procedure. In the few studies assessing the use of this technique, the rates of osteonecrosis and heterotopic ossification are lower than with open techniques. It is worth noting that the studies assessing the use of this procedure are limited both in number and quality; however, the results of these studies have been excellent. It must also be noted that patients undergoing arthroscopic fixation are mostly selected for this treatment because they have less severe injuries(2-12). EXPECTED OUTCOMES: Open reduction and fixation through one of a variety of approaches is the gold standard treatment for Pipkin fractures; however, it is a relatively invasive procedure, prone to increased risks of osteonecrosis of the femoral head and heterotopic ossification (from 4% to 78% of cases). In some cases, arthroscopic reduction and fixation can be as effective as open reduction, and carries with it the intrinsic advantages of a keyhole procedure. The reported 4.6% global complication rate following arthroscopic fixation demonstrates the potential advantages of this technique, with limits due to the low numbers of treated cases(4). IMPORTANT TIPS: The operating room should be carefully set up, especially regarding the positions of the C-arm and the arthroscopy tower, which should be double-checked before starting the procedure.The medial portal should be created after identification of the saphenous vein on an ultrasound scan. The anesthesiologist or a radiologist may mark the vein on the skin preoperatively, or the surgeon may extend the arthroscopic portal and perform a superficial dissection to avoid the vessel.Visualization after creation of the portals is usually suboptimal until the hematoma is completely removed. Patience must be maintained in this phase of the procedure.A microfracture awl or a large Kirschner wire can be utilized as a joystick to aid in reduction of the fragment, from either the usual portals or the medial portal. This aid can facilitate rotation of the fragment, which is a key step in the reduction phase.Definitive fixation can be achieved with use of 4.5-mm cannulated headless screws. Large cannulated headless screws have longer and larger Kirschner wires that can also aid in reduction when used as joysticks, reducing the risk of bending or breaking during screw insertion. Additionally, a 4.5-mm screwdriver is longer, allowing easier insertion, especially in patients with a larger thigh. The large diameter should not be a concern because the head is sunk in a non-weight-bearing area of the head.To avoid the risk of misplacement or loss of the screw during its insertion, make use of a cannulated guide handle for 4.5-mm screws, such as the guide utilized in a Latarjet arthroscopic procedure.To prevent screw loss into the joint, utilize a loop-knotted wire around the proximal part of the screw; this wire is cut at the end of the procedure.

2D,38357469,Wedgeless V-Shaped Osteotomy of the Distal Medial Femur with Locking Plate Fixation for Correction of Genu Valgum in Adolescents and Young Adults.,"BACKGROUND: Genu valgum is a common disorder affecting adolescents and young adults. Treatment of this disorder requires restoration of normal mechanical axis alignment and joint orientation, for which it is important to assess whether the deformity arises from the distal femur, knee joint, or proximal tibia. Most commonly, the deformity originates from the distal femur, and various osteotomies of the distal femur have been described(1-6). The presently described wedgeless V-shaped osteotomy(7,8) is a good option among the various alternative procedures listed below. DESCRIPTION: The anesthetized patient is placed in the supine position on a radiolucent operating table. A bolster is placed beneath the knee to relax the posterior structures. A medial longitudinal skin incision is made that extends from the level of the medial joint line to 5 cm proximal to the adductor tubercle. The vastus medialis is identified and elevated anteriorly by detaching it from its distal and posterior aspects. The leash of vessels underneath the vastus medialis is identified, and the apex of the V-shaped osteotomy is kept just proximal to it. The anterior arm of the V is kept longer than the posterior one, both of them are kept perpendicular to each other, and the apex of the V is made to point distally. The osteotomy is performed on the medial cortex with use of an oscillating saw or multiple drill holes that are then connected using a thin osteotome. Care is taken not to utilize a saw or drill on the lateral cortex. A gentle valgus thrust is applied to break the lateral cortex without periosteal disruption. The apex of the V osteotomy on the proximal fragment is trimmed, and the deformity is corrected with varus force. The osteotomy site is stabilized with use of an anatomically contoured distal medial femoral locking plate or a medial proximal tibial L-shaped buttress plate (of the contralateral side). The implant position is verified under a C-arm image intensifier. The wound is closed in layers over a suction drain in a standard manner. ALTERNATIVES: Various types of corrective osteotomies of the distal femur have been described in the literature, including the lateral opening wedge, medial closing wedge, dome, and spike osteotomies(1-6). All of these procedures have certain limitations and shortcomings. RATIONALE: The wedgeless V-shaped osteotomy is another described procedure that is inherently stable(7,8). It is a safe procedure and yields good clinical outcomes(8,9). The posterior arm of the V-shaped osteotomy is kept smaller than the anterior arm. The proximal cortical bone is allowed to dig into the cancellous bone of the wider distal metaphysis during deformity correction. Trimming the apex of proximal bone end after making the osteotomy facilitates the process. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: In a study of 46 patients with a mean age of 16.9 years (range, 15 years to 23 years), Gupta et al.(8) reported that the mean radiographic tibiofemoral angle improved from 22.2° (range, 16° to 29°) preoperatively to 5.1° (range, 0° to 10°) postoperatively (p < 0.001). Similarly, the mean lateral distal femoral angle improved from 79.2° preoperatively to 89.1° postoperatively (p < 0.001) and the mean mechanical axis deviation improved from 19.6 mm preoperatively to 3.7 mm postoperatively (p < 0.001). A total of 44 of 46 cases had an excellent functional outcome, with the other 2 having good outcomes. None of the patients in the study had an unsatisfactory outcome. IMPORTANT TIPS: It is important to keep the whole lower limb accessible to the image intensifier intraoperatively.Identification of the leash of vessels underneath the vastus medialis is important to decide the level of the osteotomy.It is important to preserve the periosteal sleeve on the lateral aspect of the femur.

2D,17492542,Interobserver variability of 64-slice computed tomography for the quantification of non-calcified coronary atherosclerotic plaque.,"PURPOSE: Multidetector CT (MDCT) is a reliable tool to assess and quantify calcified plaque in coronary arteries. Only very limited information is available concerning the accuracy of MDCT for evaluating non-calcified plaque. We determined the interobserver variability for measuring non-calcified plaque volumes in the three main coronary arteries using 64-slice computed tomography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated data sets of 41 patients who received a 64-slice CT scan (Sensation 64, Siemens Forchheim, Germany, 330 msec rotation, 0.6 mm collimation, 60 ml contrast agent i. v. at 5 ml/sec) due to suspected stable coronary artery disease. The patients showed presence of non-calcified plaque in the proximal part of at least one main coronary artery. The image quality was defined on the basis of a 4-point rating scale. Two independent and blinded investigators measured the plaque volume of the non-calcified plaque by manually tracing plaque areas in contiguous cross-sectional reconstructions rendered along the vessel centerline using a slice thickness of 1 mm and an increment of 0.5 mm. The interobserver variability was evaluated and the influence of plaque volume and image quality on interobserver variability was determined. RESULTS: The mean volume of non-calcified plaque was 157 +/- 85 mm (3), 76 +/- 43 mm (3) and 133 +/- 80 mm (3) for the LAD, LCX and RCA, respectively (LAD vs. LCX: p < 0.01; LAD vs. RCA: p = 0.33; LCX vs. RCA: p < 0.01). There was a mean absolute difference in plaque volume between the two observers of 23 +/- 15 mm (3), of 20 +/- 9 mm (3) and of 38 +/- 21 mm (3), which corresponds to a mean interobserver variability of 17 +/- 10 %, 29 +/- 13 % and 32 +/- 13 % for the LAD, LCX and RCA, respectively (LAD vs. LCX: p < 0.01; LAD vs. RCA: p < 0.01; LCX vs. RCA: p = 0.87). A significant inverse correlation between interobserver variability and the extent of the plaque volume (r = - 0.48; p = 0.01) was found. Interobserver variability was dependent on image quality: The highest image quality was observed in the LAD (2.4 +/- 0.5), while the image quality in the LCX (2.1 +/- 0.7) and the RCA (2.0 +/- 0.6) was lower. CONCLUSION: Interobserver variability for the quantification of non-calcified plaque volumes in 64-slice MDCT is substantial. Interobserver variability in the LAD was significantly lower than in the LCX and the RCA. This might be due to a larger mean plaque volume and better image quality in the LAD than in other coronary arteries.",Pflederer T; Schmid M; Ropers D; Ropers U; Komatsu S; Daniel WG; Achenbach S,,2007,RoFo : Fortschritte auf dem Gebiete der Rontgenstrahlen und der Nuklearmedizin,Comparative Study; Evaluation Study; Journal Article,
2D,21492807,"Detection of coronary artery stenoses by low-dose, prospectively ECG-triggered, high-pitch spiral coronary CT angiography.","OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a new prospectively electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered high-pitch scan mode for coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA), which allows an effective dose of less than 1 mSv. BACKGROUND: Coronary CTA provides increasingly reliable image quality, but the associated radiation exposure can be high. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with suspected coronary artery disease and in sinus rhythm were screened for participation. After exclusion of 25 patients for body weight >100 kg or failure to lower heart rate to ≤ 60 beats/min, 50 patients were studied by prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral computed tomography (CT). Coronary CTA was performed using a dual-source CT system with 2 × 128 × 0.6-mm collimation, 0.28-s rotation time, a pitch of 3.4, 100-kVp tube voltage, and current of 320 mA. Data acquisition was prospectively triggered at 60% of the R-R interval and completed within 1 cardiac cycle. Diagnostic accuracy for detection of coronary artery stenoses ≥ 50% diameter stenosis was determined by comparison to invasive coronary angiography. Per-patient diagnostic performance was the primary form of analysis. RESULTS: In all 50 patients (34 males, 59 ± 12 years of age), imaging was successful. For the detection of 16 patients with at least 1 coronary artery stenosis, CT demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 79% to 100%) and specificity of 82% (95% CI: 65% to 93%). The positive predictive value was 72% (95% CI: 49% to 89%) and the negative predictive value was 100% (95% CI: 87% to 100%). Sensitivity was 100% (95% CI: 88% to 100%) and specificity was 94% (95% CI: 89% to 97%) on a per-vessel basis. Per-segment sensitivity was 92% (95% CI: 80% to 97%), and specificity was 98% (95% CI: 96% to 98%). Mean dose-length product for coronary CTA was 54 ± 6 mGy · cm, the effective dose was 0.76 ± 0.08 mSv (0.64 to 0.95 mSv). CONCLUSIONS: In nonobese patients with a low and stable heart rate, prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral coronary CTA provides high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of coronary artery stenoses.

2D,36080747,Comprehensive Study on the Performance of Waste HDPE and LDPE Modified Asphalt Binders for Construction of Asphalt Pavements Application.,"This research is aimed at investigating the mechanical behavior of the bitumen by the addition of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) obtained from waste plastic bottles and bags. Polymers (HDPE and LDPE) with percentages of 0%, 2%, 4%, and 6% in shredded form by weight of bitumen were used to evaluate the spectroscopic, structural, morphological, and rheological properties of polymer-modified binders. The rheological properties for different factors; viscosity (ἠ) from Rotational Viscometer (RV), rutting factor G*/Sin (δ), fatigue characteristics G*. Sin (δ), for the modified binder from dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), Short and long-term aging from rolling thin film oven (RTFO), and pressure aging vessel (PAV) was determined. The thermal characteristics, grain size, and texture of polymers for both LDPE and HDPE were found using bending beam rheometer (BBR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis revealed the presence of polymer contents in the modified binder. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed the presence of HDPE and LDPE particles on the surface of the binder. Creep Rate (m) and Stiffness (S) analysis in relationship with temperature showed a deduction in stress rate relaxation. Results have revealed the best rutting resistance for 6% HDPE. It also showed an improvement of 95.27% in G*/Sin (δ) which increased the performance of the bituminous mix. Similarly, the addition of 4% LDPE resulted in maximum dynamic viscosity irrespective of the temperatures. Moreover, fatigue resistance has shown a significant change with the HDPE and LDPE. The festinating features of waste plastic modified binder make it important to be used in the new construction of roads to address the high viscosity and mixing problems produced by plastic waste and to improve the performance of flexible pavements all over the world.",Ghani U; Zamin B; Tariq Bashir M; Ahmad M; Sabri MMS; Keawsawasvong S,SEM; XRD; creep analysis; morphological analysis; spectroscopic analysis; waste polyethylene,2022,Polymers,Journal Article,Advanced Digital Technologies (contract No. 075-15-2022-311 dated 20.04.2022)/The
2D,35979791,[Comparison of short-term effectiveness of metal screws and absorbable screws in repair of distal tibiofibular syndesmosis].,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the short-term effectiveness of repairing distal tibiofibular syndesmosis with metal screws and absorbable screws. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 63 patients with ankle fracture combined with injury of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis admitted between January 2017 and January 2020. Among them, 31 patients were treated with absorbable screw fixation of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis (research group) and 32 patients were treated with metal screw fixation of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis (control group). There was no significant difference in gender, age, cause of injury, surgical side, time from injury to operation, fracture type, preoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) score, and American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) score between the two groups ( P>0.05). The operation time and fracture healing time were recorded and compared between the two groups. X-ray film was taken to evaluate the effect of ankle joint reduction and fixation. Olerud-Molander ankle fracture efficacy score (short for OM score), AOFAS score, and VAS score were used to evaluate the effectiveness. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in operation time between the two groups ( t=-0.683, P=0.497). In the control group, 1 case of delayed healing and 1 case of poor healing occurred in the lateral incision after operation, which healed after dressing change; the rest of the patients had primary healing of the incision. Patients in both groups were followed up 12-24 months, with an average of 13.8 months. In the control group, 1 patient with fracture of pronation and external rotation walked with full weight bearing after removing the metal screw of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis at 8 weeks after operation, the anatomical plate of the lateral malleolus was broken, and the lateral malleolus was fixed again and recovered after 5 months; 1 patient had mild ankle pain after operation, and the pain disappeared after removing the metal screw of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis at 8 weeks. No complication such as nerve and blood vessel injury occurred in all patients. There was no significant difference in fracture healing time between the two groups ( t=-1.128, P=0.264). The AOFAS and VAS scores significantly improved in both groups at 12 months after operation ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in the OM scores, and the difference of AOFAS and VAS scores between before and after operation ( P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Using absorbable screws to repair the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis can effectively restore the ankle acupoint structure, prevent ankle instability, and restore good ankle function. There is no significant difference in effectiveness between absorbable screws and metal screws, and there is no need for secondary operation to remove screws.",Yuan X; Zhang B; Hu J; Lu B,Ankle fracture; absorbable screw; ankle instability; distal tibiofibular syndesmosis; internal fixation,2022,Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi =,Journal Article,
2D,30244504,Twelve-month outcomes of patients unsuitable for prolonged DAPT presenting with an acute coronary syndrome and treated with polymer-free biolimus A9 drug-coated stents.,"INTRODUCTION: Prolonged dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) is undesirable in certain patients. The biolimus-A9 drug-coated stent (BA9-DCS) has a rapid drug-elution profile allowing shortened DAPT. METHODS: The demographics, procedural data, and clinical outcomes for 505 patients presenting with an ACS to three UK centres and treated with a BA9-DCS stent (PCI-DCS) were collected, and compared to a consecutive ACS cohort of unselected patients treated in the same period with drug-eluting stents (PCI-DES). RESULTS: PCI-DCS patients were older, more often female with hypertension, chronic kidney disease, severe LV dysfunction, and peripheral vascular disease more frequent than the PCI-DES cohort. PCI-DCS patients had a much higher Mehran bleed risk score (21.5 ± 7.7 vs. 15.9 ± 7.7, P < 0.0001). Baseline disease burden was greater in the PCI-DCS cohort with more left main and three vessel disease. During PCI, more stents (1.91 ± 1.1 vs. 1.57 ± 0.94, P < 0.0001), total stent length (38.2 ± 20.8 vs. 31.4 ± 20.3, P < 0.0001) and longer stents (38.2 ± 20.8 vs. 31.4 ± 20.3 mm, P < 0.0001) were used in the PCI-DCS cohort with rotational atherectomy also used more frequently. Physician-recommended DAPT duration was 2.9 ± 3.9 months for PCI-DCS patients and 11.3 ± 2.4 months for PCI-DES patients (P < 0.0001). At 12-month follow-up, definite stent thrombosis (0.6% vs. 1.1%) and TLR (3.2% vs. 2.7%) rates were similar between the two groups. After adjustment for baseline differences, there were no statistically significant differences in death and combined MACE rates at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of patients treated with polymer-free BA9 drug-coated stent who present with an ACS and who were deemed unsuitable for prolonged DAPT are encouraging.

2D,38058780,Interdisciplinary aspects of abdominal and plastic surgery - what does the (abdominal) surgeon need to know?,"INTRODUCTION: The aim was to reflect the established interdisciplinary aspects of general/abdominal and plastic surgery by means of a narrative review. Methods: (i) With specific references out of the medical literature and (ii) own clinical and perioperative as well as operating technical and tactical management experiences obtained in surgical daily practice, we present a choice of options for interdisciplinary cooperation that could be food of thought for other surgeons. CONTENT: - Decubital ulcers require pressure relieve, debridement and plastic surgery coverage, e.g., by a rotation flap plasty, V-Y flap or ""tensor-fascia-lata"" (TFL) flap depending on localization (sacral/gluteal defects, ischiadic tuber). - Coverage of soft tissue defects, e.g., after lymph node dissection, tumor lesions or disturbance of wound healing can be managed with fasciocutaneous or muscle flaps. - Bariatric surgery: Surgical interventions such as butt lift, tummy tuck should be explained and demonstrated in advance and performed commonly after reduction of the body weight. - Abdominoperineal rectum extirpation (APE): Holm's procedure with greater circumferential extent of resection at the mesorectum and the insertion site of the levator muscle at the anal sphicter muscle resulting in a substantial defect is covered by myocutaneous flap plasty. - Hernia surgery: Complicated/recurrent hernias or abdominal wall defect can be covered by flap plasty to achieve functional reconstruction, e.g., using innervated muscle. Thus, abdominal wall can respond better onto changes of pressure and tension. - Necrotising fasciitis: Even in case of suspicious fasciitis, an immediate radical debridement must be performed, followed by intensive care with calculated antibiotic treatment; after appropriate stabilization tissue defects can be covered by mesh graft of flap plasty. - Soft tissue tumor lesions cannot be resected with primary closure to achieve appropriate as intended R0 resection status by means of local radical resection all the time - plastic surgery expertise has to be included into interdisciplinary tumor concepts. - Liposuction/-filling: Liposuction can be used with aesthetic intention after bariatric surgery or for lipedema. Lipofilling is possible for reconstruction and for aesthetic purpose. - Reconstruction of lymphatic vessels: Lymphedema after tumor operations interrupting or blocking lymphatic drainage can be treated with microsurgical reconstructions (such as lympho-venous anastomoses, lympho-lymphatic anastomoses or free microvascular lymph node transfer). - Microsurgery: It is substantial part of modern reconstructive plastic surgery, i.e., surgery of peripheral nerves belongs to this field. For visceral surgery, it can become important for reconstruction of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. - Sternum osteomyelitis: Radical debridement (eventually, complete sternal resection) with conditioning of the wound by vacuum-assisted closure followed by plastic surgery coverage can prevent chronification, threatening mediastinitis, persisting infectious risk, long-term suffering or limited quality of life. SUMMARY: The presented selection of single topics can only be an excerpt of all the options for surgical cooperation in daily clinical and surgical practice. OUTLOOK: An interdisciplinary approach of abdominal and plastic surgery is characterized by a highly developed cooperation in common surgical interventions including various techniques and tactics highlighting the specifics of the two fields.",Kraus A; Damert HG; Meyer F,abdominal surgery; latissimus-dorsi flap; pediculated/free flap transfer; plastic surgery; rectus-abdominis flap,2023,Innovative surgical sciences,Journal Article; Review,
2D,11276435,Recent advances in multivessel coronary grafting without cardiopulmonary bypass.,"BACKGROUND: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) without the heart lung machine has been possible for easily accessible targets such as the anterior descending or proximal right coronary. Until now technical difficulty in reaching lateral and inferior wall targets imposed significant barriers to multivessel off-pump grafting. To expand the potential for off-pump CABG the authors have devised new exposure and stabilization techniques suitable for all target vessels. In this report we relate our experience with these new techniques and demonstrate that multivessel coronary bypass can be safely performed without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS: From February 8, 1993 to December 16, 1997 a total of 280 patients underwent myocardial revascularization on the beating heart via median sternotomy. Until May 20, 1997 only patients with high preoperative risk factors for CPB were considered for this approach (Group A; N = 122). After this date any patients with favorable anatomy were included (Group B; N = 158) and were subsequently compared with patients operated on using CPB during the same time interval (Group C; N = 114). In Group B patients lateral and/or inferior wall targets were exposed by means of 4 cloth slings (2 through the transverse sinus and 2 behind the inferior vena cava) and by positioning the patients in Trendelenburg with rightward rotation of the table. Regional stabilization of the target artery was obtained with a commercial stabilizing foot plate. RESULTS: Thirty day hospital mortality was only 2 patients (1.6%) in Group A, 3 patients (1.9%) in Group B, and 3 patients (2.6%) in Group C (NS). Postoperative complications were low in both Group A and B. When Group B was compared with a similar cohort in whom CPB was used (Group C), there were statistically significant improvements in ICU and hospital stay demonstrated when CPB was not used (16.8+/-10.7 vs 26.3+/-38.6 hours respectively; p = 0.007, and 4.1+/-1.5 vs 5.5+/-2.4 days respectively, p<0.001). Angiographic followup was available for 78 patients in Groups A and B with a global patency rate (all grafts) of 98.6%, including a patency rate of 96.7% for 60 grafts to obtuse marginal branches of the circumflex). CONCLUSIONS: Multivessel CABG without CPB is possible with results similar to those obtained with pump-oxygenator support using simple exposure and stabilization techniques.",Calafiore AM; Di Giammarco G; Teodori G; Mazzei V; Vitolla G,,1998,The heart surgery forum,Clinical Trial; Journal Article,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients (47 men, age 69.6 +/- 9.6 years, body mass index 26.6 +/- 3.5 kg/m) underwent clinically indicated 128-slice dual-source CT angiography of the entire thorax for the evaluation of graft patency after CABG surgery using a prospectively ECG-synchronized high-pitch spiral acquisition mode (pitch 3.2; 100 kV tube voltage, 0.28 seconds gantry rotation time). Heart rates (HR) were noted. Image quality of the proximal anastomosis, graft body, distal anastomosis, and postanastomotic coronary artery were graded by 2 independent readers on a 3-point scale (1 = excellent, 2 = moderate, and 3 = poor/nondiagnostic). Quantitative image quality parameters (noise, contrast-to-noise ratio) were measured. Effective radiation doses were calculated. RESULTS: Mean HR was 76 +/- 19 bpm (range, 45-135 bpm). Median scan time was 0.9 seconds (range, 0.76-1.17 seconds), mean scan length was 349 +/- 38 mm (range, 294-452 mm). A total of 125 CABG (54% arterial grafts) and 465 vessel sections were analyzed. Twelve grafts were proximally occluded. Diagnostic image quality was obtained in 462 (99.4%) sections. Of those, image quality was excellent in 397 (85.4%) and moderate in 65 (14.0%). All 3 (0.6%) nondiagnostic sections affected the distal anastomosis due to motion artifacts caused by high HR. Separating the study population by the median HR of 71 bpm, image quality of the distal anastomosis regarding motion artifacts was significantly lower at high HR (P < 0.05). Interobserver agreement in grading image quality of graft segments was good (kappa = 0.77). Image noise in the aorta was 36.9 +/- 8.1, contrast-to-noise ratio was 13.1 +/- 4.2. Effective radiation dose was 2.3 +/- 0.3 mSv. CONCLUSIONS: The patency of coronary artery bypass grafts can be assessed with decreasing image quality at high HR in high-pitch prospectively ECG-synchronized thoracic 128-slice dual-source CT angiography at a low radiation dose.",Goetti R; Leschka S; Baumüller S; Plass A; Wieser M; Desbiolles L; Stolzmann P; Falk V; Marincek B; Alkadhi H; Feuchtner G,,2010,Investigative radiology,Journal Article,
2D,14589492,A pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of small intestinal submucosa used to repair spinal ligaments in the goat.,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Destabilization of the lumbar spine results from sacrifice of the anterior longitudinal ligament and disc when removed for graft or cage placement. In a similar fashion, transection of the interspinous ligament during surgical approaches to the posterior spine may result in segmental instability. Such instability can cause abnormal motion or implant migration resulting in a higher incidence of pseudarthrosis. Small intestinal submucosa (SIS) is a naturally occurring extracellular collagen-based matrix, which is derived from porcine small intestine. SIS contains cytokines and growth factors and has been shown to act as a resorbable scaffold in vivo that promotes host soft tissue regeneration with little scar tissue formation. SIS can be manufactured in laminated sheets of various sizes and thicknesses for different indications. Successful applications of SIS in animals have included dural substitution, rotator cuff repair, vessel repair, abdominal and bladder wall repair, and others. However, SIS has not been investigated to determine its ability to facilitate regeneration of spinal ligaments. PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of SIS as a barrier to prevent interbody device migration, and to act as a scaffold for regeneration of the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) and posterior interspinous ligament (PISL) in a goat model. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: The thoracolumbar spine of the goat was exposed surgically. After resection and removal of the ALL or PISL at alternating levels, either SIS was placed or no treatment was administered. New ligament formation and SIS resorption were monitored over a 12-week period. OUTCOME MEASURES: Plain film radiographs and histomorphometry were used to assess the progress of healing over a 12-week time period. METHODS: Four skeletally mature nubian-alpine crossbred goats were used in this study. Under general anesthesia, each T10 to L5 motion segment was exposed surgically. Both anterolateral and posterior approaches were performed simultaneously at each level. Anteriorly, alternating levels received either 1) anterior discectomy, sacrifice of ALL and placement of SIS (SIS group); 2) anterior discectomy, sacrifice of ALL and no SIS (surgical control group) or 3) no surgical intervention (nonoperative group). A solid interbody spacer was placed into the disc space after discectomy to deter spontaneous anterior interbody fusion. Posteriorly, alternating levels were treated with either 1) sacrifice of the PISL with placement of SIS (SIS group); 2) sacrifice of PISL and no SIS (surgical control group) or 3) no surgical intervention (nonoperative group). The SIS was secured to the adjacent superior and inferior spinous processes to create a tension-band effect. Animals were radiographed immediately postoperatively to confirm placement of interbody spacers and anchors and to serve as a baseline for monitoring interbody spacer positioning. After surgery, all animals were allowed unrestricted motion for 12 weeks. At the end of the 12-week period, animals were radiographed and euthanized. The lumbar spine was harvested en bloc and processed for decalcified histologic evaluation. The dorsal and ventral aspects of each motion segment were analyzed for signs of inflammation and scar tissue formation, residual SIS and regenerated ALL or PISL. RESULTS: All animals tolerated the surgical procedure well, and there were no intraoperative or anesthesia-related complications. Twelve-week radiographs showed some evidence of ventral migration of the interbody spacers in several animals. Fifty percent (two of four) of spacers in surgical control group levels had migrated more than 10 mm (resulting in complete migration out of the disc space), whereas no spacers migrated completely out of levels with SIS placed. Gross analysis at necropsy indicated iatrogenic scar formation at operated levels, the degree of which was not different from surgical control group to SIS levels. Histologic evaluation of areas where the ALL had been removed indicated formation of organized fibrilar collagenous tissue that spanned the disc space at some levels where the SIS was placed. In some cases, the newly formed tissue was approximately the thickness of the ALL at the nonoperative group levels. The newly formed collagenous tissue was accompanied by sparse focal areas of inflammation, with small fragments of residual SIS at some levels. At surgical control group levels, there was a varying degree of connective tissue that ranged from moderately organized to randomly oriented with no significant signs of inflammation. Similarly, histologic analysis of some levels where SIS was placed posteriorly showed formation of organized collagenous tissues where the PISL had been removed. CONCLUSIONS: In this model, the SIS patch was sufficient to prevent acute ventral migration of interbody spacers from the disc space. The extent of long-term healing and new tissue formation in the SIS group indicates that it may be efficacious as a reparative intervention for transected ligaments in the spine. Most SIS specimens showed formation of organized collagenous tissue, indicating a long-term potential for ligament formation. However, in this model, 12 weeks of postoperative healing is insufficient to assess the full potential of SIS as a spinal ligament repair. Further research that follows the healing process to a longer time point postoperatively may be necessary to fully understand the potential of SIS as a resorbable scaffold for tissue replacement.",Ledet EH; Carl AL; DiRisio DJ; Tymeson MP; Andersen LB; Sheehan CE; Kallakury B; Slivka M; Serhan H,,2002,The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",

METHODS: Between July 2009 and December 2019 at our University Cardiology Department, 118 consecutive patients underwent a thorough diagnostic work-up including standardized history taking, clinical evaluation, full neurological examination, screening for thrombophilia, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound-Doppler sonography of supra-aortic vessels and 24 h ECG Holter monitoring. Anatomo-morphological evaluation using 2D transthoracic/transesophageal echocardiography (TTE/TEE) color Doppler and functional assessment using contrast TTE (cTTE) in the apical four-chamber view and contrast transcranial Doppler (cTCD) using power M-mode modality were performed to verify the presence, location and amount of right-to-left shunting via PFO or other extracardiac source. Completed questionnaires based on the Quality-of-Life Short Form-36 (QoL SF-36) and Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) were obtained from the patients before PFO closure and after 12 months. Contrast TTE/TEE and cTCD were performed at dismission, 1, 6 and 12 months and yearly thereafter. Brain MRI was performed at 1-year follow-up in 54 patients. RESULTS: Transcatheter PFO closure was performed in 106 selected symptomatic patients (mean age 41.7 ± 10.7 years, range 16-63, 65% women) with the following conditions: ischemic stroke (n = 23), transient ischemic attack (n = 22), peripheral and coronary embolism (n = 2), MRI lesions without cerebrovascular clinical events (n = 53), platypnea-orthodeoxia (n = 1), decompression sickness (n = 1) and refractory migraine without ischemic cerebral lesions (n = 4). The implanted devices were Occlutech Figulla Flex I/II PFO (n = 99), Occlutech UNI (n = 3), Amplatzer PFO (n = 3) and CeraFlex PFO occluders (n = 1). Procedures were performed under local anesthesia and rotational intracardiac monitoring (Ultra ICE) alone. The devices were correctly implanted in all patients. The mean fluoroscopy time was 15 ± 5 min (range = 10-45 min) and the mean procedural time was 55 ± 20 min (range = 35-90 min). The total occlusion rate at follow-up (mean 50 months, range 3-100) was 98.1%. No recurrent neurological events were observed in the long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The data collected in this study demonstrate that percutaneous PFO closure is a safe and effective procedure, showing long-term prevention of recurrent cerebrovascular events, significant reduction in migraine symptoms and substantial improvement in quality of life.",Evola S; Camarda EA; Triolo OF; Adorno D; D'Agostino A; Novo G; Onorato EM,cryptogenic stroke; migraine aura; paradoxical embolism; patent foramen ovale; quality of life; transcatheter closure; transcranial Doppler,2023,Journal of clinical medicine,Journal Article,
2D,36649390,Temporal Trends in In-Hospital Outcomes Following Unprotected Left-Main Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: An Analysis of 14 522 Cases From British Cardiovascular Intervention Society Database 2009 to 2017.,"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is increasingly used as a treatment option for unprotected left main stem artery (unprotected left main stem percutaneous intervention) disease. However, whether patient outcomes have improved over time is uncertain. METHODS: Using the United Kingdom national PCI database, we studied all patients undergoing unprotected left main stem percutaneous intervention between 2009 and 2017. We excluded patients who presented with ST-segment-elevation, cardiogenic shock, and with an emergency indication for PCI. RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2017, in the study-indicated population, 14 522 unprotected left main stem percutaneous intervention procedures were performed. Significant temporal changes in baseline demographics were observed with increasing patient age and comorbid burden. Procedural complexity increased over time, with the number of vessels treated, bifurcation PCI, number of stents used, and use of intravascular imaging and rotational atherectomy increased significantly through the study period. After adjustment for baseline differences, there were significant temporal reductions in the occurrence of peri-procedural myocardial infarction (P<0.001 for trend), in-hospital major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (P<0.001 for trend), and acute procedural complications (P<0.001 for trend). In multivariable analysis examining the associates of in-hospital major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events, while age per year (odds ratio, 1.02 [95% CIs, 1.01-1.03]), female sex (odds ratio, 1.47 [1.19-1.82]), 3 or more stents (odds ratio, 1.67 [05% [1.02-2.67]), and patient comorbidity were associated with higher rates of in-hospital major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events, by contrast use of intravascular imaging (odds ratio, 0.56 [0.45-0.70]), and year of PCI (odds ratio, 0.63 [0.46-0.87]) were associated with lower rates of in-hospital major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events.

2D,29951474,Does Masked Hypertension Cause Early Left Ventricular Impairment in Youth?,"Objectives: Masked hypertension (MH) is not uncommon in the youth and may increase risks of long-term cardiovascular impairment. However, little is known about the subclinical heart damage in this group of patients. Currently, 3-layer speckle tracking imaging based on two-dimensional echocardiography is feasible to detect the early signs of myocardial damage. We therefore aimed to investigate whether subtle changes of cardiac function occurred in the young MH patients by using advanced quantification with layer-specific speckle tracking. Methods: A total of 40 adolescents with MH (age 18 ± 3 years, 73% males) and 40 age-, gender-, race-, and height-matched normotensive volunteers were enrolled in our study. MH was defined as one or more of the ambulatory blood pressure (BP) parameters (24-h, daytime and night-time average BPs) higher than ≥ 95th percentile for gender and height according to the local reference. Both comprehensive two-dimensional echocardiography with layer-specific strain analysis and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring were performed. Longitudinal strain and circumferential strain in endocardial, mid-myocardial, and epicardial layers were determined accordingly with the dedicated software (EchoPAC software version 201, GE Healthcare, Horten, Norway). Results: Compared with normotensive controls, youths with MH had higher ambulatory pulse rate and left ventricular mass index, and were more obese. Interestingly, similar ventricular volumes and ejection fraction were observed in the study groups, but further analysis with layer-specific strains revealed that endocardial and mid-myocardial longitudinal and circumferential mechanical function were decreased in the young MH subjects when compared to normotensive individuals (all p < 0.05). However, there were no difference regarding radial strain and apical rotation derived from traditional speckle tracking analysis. Conclusion: Subclinical change of LV mechanic function assessed by layer-specific speckle tracking is present in youth with MH despite considered as normal with conventional ways.Thus, MH in youth should be monitored closely instead of labeling as an entirely benign entity.",Luo XX; Zhu Y; Sun Y; Ge Q; Su J; So HK; Yam MC; Fang F,layer-specific speckle tracking analysis; left ventricular function; masked hypertension; two-dimensional echocardiography; youth,2018,Frontiers in pediatrics,Journal Article,
2D,33827777,The outcome of laparoscopic assisted orchidopexy in very young children: A single hospital experience.,"INTRODUCTION: Early orchidopexy has been linked to improved long term outcomes of fertility and reduced malignancy rates. However, the optimal age of intervention has been subject to change over the years. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to study males aged 6 months or less who undergo laparoscopic assisted orchidopexy for intraabdominal testes to establish the safety, efficacy, and benefit in the defined age group. STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively assessed 19 boys at or below 6 months of age, who had laparoscopic assisted orchidopexy for intraabdominal undescended testes at Salmaniya Medical Complex in Bahrain between January 2014 and December 2018. We examined: demographics, laterality, testicular locations, testicular volumes, operative time, complications, and durations of hospitalization and follow-up. Ultrasound-derived testicular volumes were assessed before and after orchidopexy. They were calculated using the Hansen formula (Testicular volume = 0.52 × length [L] × width [W](2) [1]. They were then compared with reference ranges from a Dutch cohort study of 769 healthy boys. Successful outcomes were correct intrascrotal position with minimal complications and normal testicular volumes. RESULTS: A total of 19 males were operated at a mean age of 5.6 months and followed for a mean of 2.35 years. Of these, 7 had left-sided and 12 had right-sided cryptorchidism. Testicular locations were noted intra-operatively; 10 were above the internal ring, 5 near the iliac vessels, and 4 close to the kidney. The mean operative time was 59.58 minutes. Only 2 minor complications occurred and no cases of testicular atrophy. None of the patients required hospital-stay beyond 24 hours. The success rate was 89.46% in achieving correct scrotal position. Testicular volumes were normal before and after orchidopexy. They significantly increased after orchidopexy (P ≤ 0.05). The testicular growth rate after 24 months was slightly higher than normal. DISCUSSION: In line with previous studies we were 89.46% successful in re-positioning testes [2]. In contrast to studies intervening at older ages which associated intra-abdominal testes with greater risks of complications, we found few minor complications and no testicular atrophy [3,4]. Testicular volumes in the affected testes were normal, contrary to decreased volumes found by other researchers [5]. Limitations of this study are the small number of patients and short follow-up which limits assessment of long-term outcomes. CONCLUSION: Early orchiopexy is safe and effective. Laparoscopic assisted orchidopexy at an early age was beneficial and resulted in normal testicular volumes before and after surgery.

2D,20676844,Acute amiodarone promotes drift and early termination of spiral wave re-entry.,"Intravenous application of amiodarone is commonly used in the treatment of life-threatening arrhythmias, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the acute effects of amiodarone on spiral wave (SW) re-entry, the primary organization machinery of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF), in comparison with lidocaine. A two-dimensional ventricular myocardial layer was obtained from 24 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, and epicardial excitations were analyzed by high-resolution optical mapping. During basic stimulation, amiodarone (5 microM) caused prolongation of action potential duration (APD) by 5.6%-9.1%, whereas lidocaine (15 microM) caused APD shortening by 5.0%-6.4%. Amiodarone and lidocaine reduced conduction velocity similarly. Ventricular tachycardias induced by DC stimulation in the presence of amiodarone were of shorter duration (sustained-VTs >30 s/total VTs: 2/58, amiodarone vs 13/52, control), whereas those with lidocaine were of longer duration (22/73, lidocaine vs 14/58, control). Amiodarone caused prolongation of VT cycle length and destabilization of SW re-entry, which is characterized by marked prolongation of functional block lines, frequent wavefront-tail interactions near the rotation center, and considerable drift, leading to its early annihilation via collision with anatomical boundaries. Spiral wave re-entry in the presence of lidocaine was more stabilized than in control. In the anisotropic ventricular myocardium, amiodarone destabilizes SW re-entry facilitating its early termination. Lidocaine, in contrast, stabilizes SW re-entry resulting in its persistence.",Nakagawa H; Honjo H; Ishiguro YS; Yamazaki M; Okuno Y; Harada M; Takanari H; Sakuma I; Kamiya K; Kodama I,,2010,Heart and vessels,"Comparative Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,35896723,Cluster analysis of extracellular matrix biomarkers predicts the development of impaired systolic function within 1 year of acute myocardial infarction.,"The clinical utility of combining extracellular matrix (ECM) biomarkers to predict the development of impaired systolic function following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains largely undetermined. A combination of ELISA and multiplexing assays were performed to measure matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-9, periostin, N-terminal type I procollagen (PINP) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in plasma samples from 120 AMI patients. All patients had an echocardiogram within 1 year of AMI, and were divided into impaired (n = 37, LVEF < 50%) and preserved (n = 83, LVEF ≥ 50%) systolic function groups. Exploratory factor analysis was performed on log-transformed biomarkers using principle axis analysis with Oblimin rotation. Cluster analysis was performed on log-transformed and normalised biomarkers using Ward's method of minimum variance and the squared Euclidean distance metric. Upon univariate analysis, current smoking, prescription of ACE inhibitors at discharge, peak hsTnT > 610 ng/L (median), MMP-8 levels, Factor 1 scores and Cluster One assignment were predictive of impaired systolic function. Upon multivariate analysis, Cluster One assignment (odds ratio [95% CI], 2.74 [1.04-7.23], p = 0.04) remained an independent predictor of systolic dysfunction in combination with clinical variables. These observations support the usefulness of combining ECM biomarkers using cluster analysis for predicting the development of impaired systolic function in AMI patients.",Brunton-O'Sullivan MM; Holley AS; Shi B; Harding SA; Larsen PD,Acute myocardial infarction; Biomarkers; Cluster analysis; Combined biomarker analysis; Extracellular matrix,2022,Heart and vessels,Journal Article,
2D,15506637,Dendroremediation of trinitrotoluene (TNT). Part 2: fate of radio-labelled TNT in trees.,"BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE: Problems of long-term existence of the environmental contaminant 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and necessities for the use of trees ('dendroremediation') in sustainable phytoremediation strategies for TNT are described in the first part of this paper. Aims of the second part are estimation of [14C]-TNT uptake, localisation of TNT-derived radioactivity in mature tree tissues, and the determination of the degree of TNT-degradation during dendroremediation processes. METHODS: Four-year-old trees of hybrid willow (Salix spec., clone EW-20) and of Norway spruce (Picea abies) were cultivated in sand or ammunition plant soil (AP-soil) in wick supplied growth vessels. Trees were exposed to a single pulse application with water solved [U-14C]-TNT reaching a calculated initial concentration of 5.2 mg TNT per kg dry soil. Two months after application overall radioactivity and extractability of 14C were determined in sand/soil, roots, stem-wood, stem-bark, branches, leaves, needles, and Picea May sprouts. Root extracts were analysed by radio TLC. RESULTS: 60 days after [14C]-TNT application, recovered 14C is accumulated in roots (70% for sand variants, 34% for AP-soil variant). 15-28% of 14C remained in sand and 61% in AP-soil. 3.3 to 14.4% of 14C were located in aboveground tree portions. Above-ground distribution of 14C differed considerably between the angiosperm Salix and the gymnosperm Picea. In Salix, nearly half of above-ground-14C was detected in bark-free wood, whereas in Picea older needles contained most of the above-ground-14C (54-69%). TNT was readily transformed in tree tissue. Approximately 80% of 14C was non-extractably bound in roots, stems, wood, and leaves or needles. Only quantitatively less important stem-bark of Salix and Picea and May shoots of Picea showed higher extraction yields (up to 56%). DISCUSSION: Pulse application of [14C]-TNT provided evidence for the first time that after TNT-exposure, in tree root extracts, no TNT and none of the known metabolites, mono-amino-dinitrotoluenes (ADNT), diaminonitrotoluenes (DANT), trinitrobenzene (TNB) and no dinitrotoluenes (DNTs) were present. Extractable portions of 14C were small and contained at least three unknown metabolites (or groups) for Salix. In Picea, four extractable metabolites (or groups) were detected, where only one metabolite (or group) seemed to be identical for Salix and Picea. All unknown extractables were of a very polar nature. CONCLUSIONS: Results of complete TNT-transformation in trees explain some of our previous findings with 'cold analytics', where no TNT and no ADNT-metabolites could be found in tissues of TNT-exposed Salix and Populus clones. It is concluded that 'cold' tissue analysis of tree organs is not suited for quantitative success control of phytoremediation in situ. RECOMMENDATIONS AND OUTLOOK: Both short rotation Salicaceae trees and conifer forests possess a dendroremediation potential for TNT polluted soils. The degradation capacity and the large biomass of adult forest trees with their woody compartments of roots and stems may be utilized for detoxification of soil xenobiotics.",Schoenmuth BW; Pestemer W,,2004,Environmental science and pollution research international,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,33895872,Outcomes after drug-coated balloon interventions for de novo coronary lesions in the patients on chronic hemodialysis.,"The impact of drug-coated balloon (DCB) on hemodialysis (HD) patients with coronary lesions remains unclear. This study aimed to compare outcomes after DCB treatment between HD and non-HD patients with de novo coronary lesions. A total of 235 consecutive patients who electively underwent DCB treatment for de novo coronary lesions were included (HD group: n = 100; non-HD group: n = 135). Angiographic follow-up was performed 6 months after the procedure. Patients were clinically followed up for 2 years. The incidence rates of target lesion revascularization (TLR) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were investigated. Diabetes and a history of coronary bypass grafting were more frequent in the HD group than in the non-HD group (69.0% vs. 50.7%, p = 0.007, and 24.0% vs 9.1%, p = 0.013, respectively). The reference diameter and pre-procedural diameter stenosis were greater in the HD group than in the non-HD group (2.49 mm vs. 2.24 mm, p = 0.007, and 65.9% vs. 59.6%, p = 0.015, respectively). Calcification was observed in 65.5% of all lesions, and rotational atherectomy was performed in 30.2% patients. The average diameter of the DCB was 2.51 mm (2.57 mm, HD group vs. 2.47 mm, non-HD group, p = 0.14). Although post-procedural diameter stenosis was similar between the groups, late lumen loss on follow-up angiography was larger in HD patients than in non-HD patients (0.27 mm vs. - 0.03 mm, p = 0.0009). The 2-year rates of freedom from TLR and MACE were lower in HD patients than in non-HD patients [79.3% vs. 91.7%, hazard ratio (HR) 2.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-6.77, p = 0.014; and 61.6% vs. 89.4%, HR 4.60, 95% CI 2.30-10.2, p < 0.001, respectively].

2D,19018747,[Access for starting kidney replacement therapy: vascular and peritoneal temporal access in pre-dialysis].,"PATIENT EVALUATION AND PREPARATION PRIOR TO VASCULAR ACCESS (VA) PLACEMENT: 1. Early referral of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (ACKD: GFR <or= 30 ml/min: CKD stage 4) is necessary so that they are educated about the different modalities of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) and there is sufficient time to perform a permanent functioning VA before the initiation of HD (Strength of Recommendation C). 2. Preservation of the venous network of the upper extremities (UE): - Venipuntures and catheterizations in the UE should be avoided to reduce the incidence of venous occlusions and stenosis (Strength of Recommendation B). - If venipuncture or catheterization of veins of the UE is necessary, the dorsum of the hand should be the site of choice used and puncture sites should be rotated (Strength of Recommendation C). 3. Preoperative evaluation: Patient evaluation prior to VA placement should include: - A patient history and physical examination directed to evaluation of the existence and quality of the arterial and venous vessels of the UE (Strength of Recommendation B). - When necessary, a complementary examination by Doppler ultrasound (Strength of Recommendation B) or phlebography may be performed. Recommended when there is a history or central venous catheters (CVC) or pacemakers. 4. Timing of VA placement: - A vascular access should be placed starting from a GFR < 20 ml/min (Strength of Recommendation B). - The VA should be placed at least 6 months before the start of HD in the case of native AV fistulae and 3-6 weeks before in the case of synthetic VA (Strength of Recommendation B). SELECTION OF TYPE OF PERMANENT VA AND ITS LOCATION: 1. Type of VA: - A native AV fistula is the VA of choice. When a native AV fistula cannot be established, a synthetic AV graft is the second option (Strength of Recommendation A). - A CVC is the last choice after the previous two options. 2. LOCATION of the VA: In general, the order of preference for the type and location of the VA is: - A wrist (radial-cephalic) primary AV fistula (Strength of Recommendation A). - An elbow (brachial-cephalic) primary AV fistula (Strength of Recommendation B). - A transposed brachial basilic vein fistula (Strength of Recommendation B). - Synthetic or biological grafts; in order of preference, antecubital straight or looped graft, in the arm, and lastly in the chest wall or lower extremity once all options in upper extremities have been discarded (Strength of Recommendation B). CARE OF VA IN PREDIALYSIS: 1. Maturation: - A native AV fistula should not be used in the first month and 6-8 weeks (minimum 4) should be waited before use (Strength of Recommendation C). - A synthetic AV fistula should not be used for puncture for at least 2 weeks after placement and up to 4 weeks may be desirable (Strength of Recommendation C). 2. Prevention of thrombosis: Antiaggregation/Anticoagulation: 1. Systematic use of platelet antiaggregants or anticoagulants in VA to prevent thrombosis or increase their survival has not been established by the evidence and also is associated with a greater risk of bleeding. Their use can be considered in certain situations after careful assessment of the risk-benefit balance (Strength of Recommendation C). CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETERS (CVC): 1. INDICATIONS: They should not be the first option for a permanent VA and should be considered for temporary use only whenever possible. Their main indications are: - Need for urgent HD in patients without permanent VA, patients with a maturing VA or that cannot be cannulated (Strength of Recommendation A). - Inability or difficulty to establish an adequate VA due to either a poor arterial bed or lack of venous development (Strength of Recommendation B). - Hemodialysis for short periods while waiting for a living donor kidney transplant (Strength of Recommendation C). - Patients with special circumstances: very severe comorbidities that imply a life expectancy of less than 1 year, cardiovascular status contraindicating placement of VA, PD patients temporarily on HD, etc. (Strength of Recommendation C). 2. Types of CVC: Selection of the type of catheter should be based on local experience, the patient's individual circumstances and the requirements for its use. - Nontunneled CVC should be reserved for stays < 3 weeks due to their higher rate of complications (Strength of Recommendation B). - Intravascular lengths of 15 cm are recommended in the right jugular vein, 20 cm in the left jugular vein, and 20-25 cm in the femoral veins (Strength of Recommendation B). 3. LOCATION: - The first choice is the right internal jugular vein, followed by the left internal jugular vein, the external jugular vein and the femoral veins. The subclavian veins should only be used exceptionally (Strength of Recommendation A). - Placement of a CVC ipsilateral to a maturing AV fistula should be avoided (Strength of Recommendation B). The use of femoral catheters should be limited to hospitalized (bedridden) patients (Strength of Recommendation B) because they are associated with higher infection and dislodgement rates. - The tip of the CVC should be placed at the entry of the right atrium for nontunneled catheters and within the right atrium for tunneled catheters (Strength of Recommendation B). Placement of CVC in the jugular and subclavian vein should be confirmed radiologically (Strength of Recommendation A). TYPES OF CATHETER AND IMPLANTATION TECHNIQUES: - The implantation team (nephrologist, surgeon, nurse) is more important for results than the technique of implantation used (Strength of Recommendation A). - No catheter has been demonstrated to be superior to others (Strength of Recommendation A). - Surgical, laparoscopic or percutaneous technique show similar results (Strength of Recommendation A). TIMING OF CATHETER IMPLANTATION: - Between catheter insertion and the start of peritoneal dialysis (PD) at least two weeks should be allowed to avoid early leaks (Strength of Recommendation C). - Antibiotic prophylaxis should be performed prior to the implantation procedure (preferably a 1st generation cephalosporin) (Strength of Recommendation A). EARLY COMPLICATIONS AND THEIR TREATMENT: - Prevention of exit site infections: It is mandatory to identify Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriers and treat them with mupirocin ointment either intranasal or pericatheter, or gentamycin pericatheter, to reduce the incidence of infections by this germ (Strength of Recommendation A). - Treatment of exit site infections: Treatment should conform to the PD guidelines published by the SEN. Withdrawal of the catheter due to exit site infection should be considered when there is concurrent peritonitis by the same germ (except coagulase-negative staphylococcus) or treatment-refractory or recurrent infections by the same germ (Strength of Recommendation C). - Mechanical complications: If leakage of peritoneal fluid occurs and dialysis is necessary, the patient should be temporarily transferred to HD or started on automatic peritoneal dialysis (APD) with low volumes and in a decubitus position.",Rodríguez CR; Bardón Otero E; Vila Paz ML,,2008,Nefrologia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola Nefrologia,English Abstract; Journal Article; Practice Guideline,

Here, we investigated differences in LAA structures in patients with PAF and those with normal sinus rhythms (NSR) using 3D-computed tomography (3D-CT), which allows us to visualize complicated LAA structures at high spatial resolution. Study subjects were 30 consecutive PAF and 30 NSR patients with complete enhanced cardiac 3D-CT images available. After reconstruction of 3D LAA images, anatomical parameters of the LAA were measured and compared according to three proposed definitions of the LAA orifice plane determined by the following anatomical landmarks: DEF#1, center of warfarin ridge and centerline of proximal left circumflex artery; DEF#2, slope of warfarin ridge and mitral valve annulus; DEF#3, observers' discretion by progressive rotation using the observers' best estimate without the use of landmarks. The LAA volumes of the PAF groups were significantly greater than the NSR group according to all 3 definitions (DEF#1: 1.43 times, DEF#2: 1.44 times, and DEF#3: 1.36 times greater). The LAA orifice area was significantly larger in PAF than in NSR according to DEF#2, but was similar by DEF#1 and DEF#3. Intra-observer and inter-observer variations for any LAA measurements were very low. In conclusion, 3D-CT-based quantitative assessment of the LAA provides highly reproducible and detailed measurements, which can successfully discriminate differences of LAA volume between patients with NSR and those with PAF, suggesting significantly greater volumes in the latter.",Hozawa M; Morino Y; Matsumoto Y; Tanaka R; Nagata K; Kumagai A; Tashiro A; Doi A; Yoshioka K,Cardioembolic stroke; Computed tomography; Left atrial appendage; Orifice; Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,2018,Heart and vessels,Journal Article,
2D,31131388,Abnormal aortic flow profiles persist after aortic valve replacement in the majority of patients with aortic valve disease: how model-based personalized therapy planning could improve results. A pilot study approach.,"OBJECTIVES: Complex blood flow profiles in the aorta are known to contribute to vessel dilatation. We studied flow profiles in the aorta in patients with aortic valve disease before and after surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). METHODS: Thirty-four patients with aortic valve disease underwent 4-dimensional velocity-encoded magnetic resonance imaging before and after AVR (biological valve = 27, mechanical valve = 7). Seven healthy volunteers served as controls. Eccentricity (ES) and complex flow scores (CFS) were determined from the degree of helicity, vorticity and eccentricity of flow profiles in the aorta. Model-based therapy planning was used in 4 cases to improve in silico postoperative flow profiles by personalized adjustment of size, rotation and angulation of the valve as well as aorta diameter. RESULTS: Patients with aortic valve disease showed more complex flow than controls [median ES 2.5 (interquartile range (IQR) 2.3-2.7) vs 1.0 (IQR 1.0-1.0), P < 0.001, median CFS 4.7 (IQR 4.3-4.8) vs 1.0 (IQR 1.0-2.0), P < 0.001]. After surgery, flow complexity in the total patient cohort was reduced, but remained significantly higher compared to controls [median ES 2.3 (IQR 1.9-2.3) vs 1.0 (IQR 1.0-1.0), P < 0.001, median CFS 3.8 (IQR 3.0-4.3) vs 1.0 (IQR 1.0-2.0), P < 0.001]. In patients after mechanical AVR, flow complexity fell substantially and showed no difference from controls [median ES 1.0 (IQR 1.0-2.3) vs 1.0 (IQR 1.0-1.0), P = 0.46, median CFS 1.0 (IQR 1.0-3.3) vs 1.0 (IQR 1.0-2.0), P = 0.71]. In all 4 selected cases (biological, n = 2; mechanical, n = 2), model-based therapy planning reduced in silico complexity of flow profiles compared to the existing post-surgical findings [median ES 1.7 (IQR 1.4-1.7) vs 2.3 (IQR 2.3-2.3); CFS 1.7 (IQR 1.4-2.5) vs 3.8 (IQR 3.3-4.3)]. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal flow profiles in the aorta more frequently persist after surgical AVR. Model-based therapy planning might have the potential to optimize treatment for best possible individual outcome.

2D,31446049,SIS/aligned fibre scaffold designed to meet layered oesophageal tissue complexity and properties.,"With donor organs not readily available, the need for a tissue-engineered oesophagus remains high, particularly for congenital childhood conditions such as atresia. Previous attempts have not been successful, and challenges remain. Small intestine submucosa (SIS) is an acellular matrix material with good biological properties; however, as is common with these types of materials, they demonstrate poor mechanical properties. In this work, electrospinning was performed to mechanically reinforce tubular SIS with polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanofibres. It was hypothesised that if attachment could be achieved between the two materials, then this would (i) improve the SIS mechanical properties, (ii) facilitate smooth muscle cell alignment to support directional growth of muscle cells and (iii) allow for the delivery of bioactive molecules (VEGF in this instance). Through a relatively simple multistage process, adhesion between the layers was achieved without chemically altering the SIS. It was also found that altering mandrel rotation speed affected the alignment of the PLGA nanofibres. SIS-PLGA scaffolds performed mechanically better than SIS alone; yield stress improvement was 200% and 400% along the longitudinal and circumferential directions, respectively. Smooth muscle cells cultured on the aligned fibres showed resultant unidirectional alignment. In vivo the SIS-PLGA scaffolds demonstrated limited foreign body reaction judged by the type and proportion of immune cells present and lack of fibrous encapsulation. The scaffolds remained intact at 4 weeks in vivo, and good cellular infiltration was observed. The incorporation of VEGF within SIS-PLGA scaffolds increased the blood vessel density of the surrounding tissues, highlighting the possible stimulation of endothelialisation by angiogenic factor delivery. Overall, the designed SIS-PLGA-VEGF hybrid scaffolds might be used as a potential matrix platform for oesophageal tissue engineering. In addition to this, achieving improved attachment between layers of acellular matrix materials and electrospun fibre layers offers the potential utility in other applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Because of its multi-layered nature and complex structure, the oesophagus tissue poses several challenges for successful clinical grafting. Therefore, it is promising to utilise tissue engineering strategies to mimic and form structural compartments for its recovery. In this context, we investigated the use of tubular small intestine submucosa (SIS) reinforced with polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanofibres by using electrospinning and also, amongst other parameters, the integrity of the bilayered structure created. This was carried out to facilitate smooth muscle cell alignment, support directional growth of muscle cells and allow the delivery of bioactive molecules (VEGF in this study). We evaluated this approach by using in vitro and in vivo models to determine the efficacy of this new system.",Syed O; Kim JH; Keskin-Erdogan Z; Day RM; El-Fiqi A; Kim HW; Knowles JC,Acellular organ matrix; Electrospinning; Oesophageal tissue; PLGA,2019,Acta biomaterialia,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
2D,31126713,A case of obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly syndrome complicated with pyometra: tips and tricks for laparoscopic hemihysterectomy.,"OBJECTIVE: To present a case of obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly (OHVIRA) syndrome complicated with pyometra and explain tips and tricks for laparoscopic hemihysterectomy. DESIGN: A step-by-step explanation of the technique with the use of video (Canadian Task Force Classification III). Patient consent and Institutional Review Board approval were obtained. SETTING: OHVIRA syndrome is characterized by the triad of uterovaginal duplication, obstructed hemivagina, and ipsilateral renal agenesis (1). Patients with OHVIRA syndrome usually present with dysmenorrhea and a vaginal or a pelvic mass. Renal, uterine, and vaginal pathologies can be diagnosed with the use of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (2). In cases in which the diagnosis is not delayed, treatment consists of vaginal septostomy (3). Delayed diagnosis may lead to pelvic infections in patients with microperforations in the septum, which may lead to abscess formation, pelvic inflammatory disease, pyometra, and subsequent need for hemihysterectomy and adnexectomy (4). PATIENT(S): A 21-year-old G2 P2 patient who had a history of hospitalization with the diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess three times previously presented to the emergency department with pelvic pain, nausea, high fever, and malodorous vaginal discharge. On physical examination, a pelvic abscess draining to the left vaginal wall and a 10-12-cm left adnexal mass were noticed. A diagnosis of OHVIRA syndrome and pyometra was made after evaluation of ultrasonographic and MRI findings. Longitudinal vaginal septum excision and drainage of the abscess was performed. Ten cubic centimeters of purulent abscess material was drained by incising the left vaginal wall. However, the mass extending from the left vaginal wall to the left adnexal area could not be drained. On hysteroscopy, no cervix was visualized belonging to the obstructed hemivagina and the left uterine cavity could not be entered. On reexamination of the MR images, the presence of a transverse vaginal septum overlying the left hemivagina was detected, preventing access to the left hemiuterine cavity. The transverse vaginal septum could have been excised and the pyometra drained; however, owing to the presence of chronic pelvic pain and dyspareunia, and a history of three failed previous attempts at treatment, the decision to perform hemihysterectomy was made. INTERVENTION(S): A laparoscopic hemihysterectomy was performed in the patient, who was diagnosed as having OHVIRA syndrome complicated with pyometra. Patient consent and Institutional Review Board approval were obtained for this report. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): On laparoscopy, the left hemiuterus on the same side as the obstructed hemivagina appeared three to four times larger than the normal hemiuterus, in which two pregnancies had occurred, and dense adhesions were present between this hemiuterus and the bowel. The left hemiuterus was densely adherent to the pelvic side wall. Laparoscopic hemihysterectomy was performed. A monofilament barbed suture were used for the repair of the paracervical area and left hemivagina. A transverse septum and cervical atresia was noticed at the distal end of the left hemiuterus. The surgical challenges encountered during treatment of this case were the difficulty in recognizing anatomic structures owing to chronic inflammatory changes, dissecting dense adhesions without injuring neighboring pelvic organs, providing adequate hemostasis during dissection of fragile and hemorrhagic tissues, gaining optimal visualization of the surgical field owing to hampered hemostasis, obtaining adequate exposure of the surgical site owing to the inability to use a uterine manipulator, and the difficulty in dissecting the left hemiuterus without damaging the right hemiuterus for fertility preservation. The ultrasonic scalpel is an energy modality that is known to cause the least amount of collateral thermal tissue damage. In the present case, an ultrasonic scalpel was used to dissect dense adhesions between the left hemiuterus and the urinary bladder to minimize the risk of thermal injury to the urinary bladder. The ultrasonic scalpel was also used when dissecting the unhealthy hemiuterus from the healthy hemiuterus owing to its ergonomic tip and to avoid thermal damage to the cervix of the healthy hemiuterus. In areas of dense adhesions and distorted anatomy, the broad tips of bipolar forceps are also helpful for blunt dissection and the creation of tissue planes, and it is also used for effective concomitant hemostasis. A vessel sealer is the most appropriate energy modality for providing effective hemostasis during dissection of the uterine artery while causing minimal collateral tissue damage (5, 6). When deciding the kind of energy modality to be used during operative laparoscopy, the source that minimized thermal injury while providing optimal hemostasis was preferred. Furthermore, additional features such as rotation, dissection, grasping, and the ergonomics of the tip of the device were also considered when choosing the energy source to be used. RESULT(S): The patient was discharged 48 hours postoperatively with no complications. No symptoms of pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia were present at the end of the third month after surgery. CONCLUSION(S): Understanding the exact nature of the uterine anomaly before hemihysterectomy is of paramount importance for a successful surgery. Laparoscopy is a safe and effective treatment modality even in the presence of dense pelvic adhesions and distorted pelvic anatomy. Elsevier Inc.

2D,29721674,Use of the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) and WCD-based remote rhythm monitoring in a real-life patient cohort.,"The wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) was introduced to provide protection from sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with transiently elevated risk or during ongoing risk stratification. Benefits and clinical characteristics of routine WCD use remain to be assessed in larger patient populations. This study aims to identify determinants of WCD compliance, therapies, and inappropriate alarms in a real-life cohort. A total of 106 cases (68.9% male) were included between 11/2010 and 04/2016. WCD therapies, automatically recorded arrhythmia episodes, inappropriate WCD alarms, patient compliance, and outcome after WCD prescription were analyzed. Median duration of WCD use was 58.5 days. Average daily wearing time was 22.7 h. Compliance was reduced in patients ≤ 50 years. Three patients received WCD therapies (2.8%). In one case ventricular fibrillation (VF) was appropriately terminated with the first shock. Two patients received inappropriate WCD therapies due to WCD algorithm activation during ventricular pacemaker stimulation. One patient died of asystole while carrying a WCD (0.9%). Additional arrhythmias detected comprised self-terminating sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT; 2.8%), non-sustained VT (2.8%), and supraventricular arrhythmias (5.7%). Inappropriate WCD alarms due to over-/undersensing occurred in 77/106 patients (72.6%), of which 41 (38.7%) experienced ≥ 10 inappropriate WCD alarms during the prescription period. Thirteen patients (12.3%) displayed a mean of > 1 inappropriate alarms/day. WCD use was associated with high compliance and provided protection from VT/VF-related SCD. The majority of patients experienced inappropriate WCD alarms. Alterations in QRS morphology during pacemaker stimulation require consideration in WCD programming to prevent inappropriate alarms.",Zylla MM; Hillmann HAK; Proctor T; Kieser M; Scholz E; Zitron E; Katus HA; Thomas D,Rhythm monitoring; Risk stratification; Sudden cardiac death; Wearable cardioverter-defibrillator,2018,Heart and vessels,Journal Article,"Rotation Grant/German Center for Cardiovascular Research/; Cardiology Career Program/Department of Cardiology, University Hospital; Klaus-Georg/German Cardiac Society/; Sigrid Hengstberger Scholarship/German Cardiac Society/; F/08/14/German Heart Foundation/German Foundation of Heart Research/; 2014_A242/Else Kröner-Fresenius-Stiftung/; (Sonderlinie Medizin/Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts"
2D,38488694,In Vivo Intelligent Fluorescence Endo-Microscopy by Varifocal Meta-Device and Deep Learning.,"Endo-microscopy is crucial for real-time 3D visualization of internal tissues and subcellular structures. Conventional methods rely on axial movement of optical components for precise focus adjustment, limiting miniaturization and complicating procedures. Meta-device, composed of artificial nanostructures, is an emerging optical flat device that can freely manipulate the phase and amplitude of light. Here, an intelligent fluorescence endo-microscope is developed based on varifocal meta-lens and deep learning (DL). The breakthrough enables in vivo 3D imaging of mouse brains, where varifocal meta-lens focal length adjusts through relative rotation angle. The system offers key advantages such as invariant magnification, a large field-of-view, and optical sectioning at a maximum focal length tuning range of ≈2 mm with 3 µm lateral resolution. Using a DL network, image acquisition time and system complexity are significantly reduced, and in vivo high-resolution brain images of detailed vessels and surrounding perivascular space are clearly observed within 0.1 s (≈50 times faster).

RPM,30627934,Characterization of the Solid Physical State of API and Its Distribution in Pharmaceutical Hot Melt Extrudates Using Terahertz Raman Imaging.,"In this study, a method employing THz Raman imaging to characterize the solid state of acetaminophen within a solid dispersion prepared by hot melt extrusion was reported. The peak at 89 cm(-1) originating from the crystalline lattice vibrations provides unambiguous discrimination between crystalline and amorphous N-acetyl-para-aminophenol (APAP; acetaminophen) contents in the hot melt extrusion (HME) extrudates. Extrudates from four different HME processes (two different temperatures and two levels of screw speeds) were analyzed and compared. The results show that both high process temperature and high screw speed favor the formation of amorphous APAP solid dispersions. Finally, the high spatial resolution (~ 1 μm) Raman images of the extrudates prepared at 170°C and 200 rpm show a near-complete amorphous APAP dispersion in an HPMC matrix, confirming an efficient HME process. The study demonstrates that THz Raman imaging is ideally suited for the identification of different solid physical states of the APIs in a polymer matrix, and provides direct visualization of their distribution in HME extrudates.",Ibrahim M; Zhang J; Repka M; Chen R,acetaminophen; amorphous solid dispersion; hot melt extrusion; solid physical state; spatial resolution; terahertz raman imaging,2019,AAPS PharmSciTech,Journal Article,
RPM,30599283,Biomimetic dynamic membrane for aquatic dye removal.,"This study utilized physical adsorption and filtration of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and laccases to fabricate biomimetic dynamic membrane (BDM) for the advanced treatment of dye wastewater. In BDM, the adsorption, enzymatic degradation and membrane separation demonstrated a synergism effect on pollutant removal. At first, the fabrication methods of BDM were investigated, and the mixed filtration for laccases and CNTs showed a better performance than the stepwise filtration. Furthermore, the operation parameters of BDM, including CNTs and laccase loading amounts, dye concentration, agitation speed and transmembrane pressure (TMP), were studied. Suitable CNTs and laccase amounts could reduce filtration resistance and increase catalysis efficiency, while moderate TMP and agitation speed were in favor of boosting the BDM structure for catalysis and permeability. Optimized operation parameters (CNT loading amount = 20 g m(-2), laccase loading amount = 74.6 g m(-2), agitation speed = 100 rpm, and TMP = 1.0 bar) sustained a high removal rate, and the flux was over 120 L m(-2) h(-1), even for 7 operation cycle' tests. BDM exhibited an excellent dye removal rate, stable flux and great antifouling capacity, on the ground that adsorption saturation and foulant may be alleviated ""online and in-situ"" by the enzymatic degradation. Afterwards, the bionic layer on BDM, after absorption saturation and catalyst deactivation, could be eliminated rapidly by carrying out a simple backwash cleaning operation, then a new one could be fabricated immediately. Therefore, BDM is a good candidate for functional membrane materials in future water treatment.",Chen W; Mo J; Du X; Zhang Z; Zhang W,Adsorption; Adsorptive dynamic membrane (ADM); Biomimetic dynamic membrane (BDM); Dye removal; Enzymatic degradation,2019,Water research,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",
RPM,30480392,[The study of psycho-social well being in the educational contexts toward the Va.RP tool: a study case.].,"OBJECTIVES: The organizational well-being construct has become a theme with broad scientific and law debate, pertaining prevention and protection measures concerning work-related stress, both for assessment and intervention on psychosocial risks. This paper focuses on a case study identified in a specific organizational context of a upper middle school. METHODS: Starting from a research-intervention perspective, this paper was primarily based on the use of the ""Psychosocial Risk Assessment"" (Va.RP) Italian tool, in shape for medium organizations, Va.RP-M, in a further form specially remodeled for organizational school contexts.

RPM,30195129,Selective ionic liquid solvent bar micro-extraction for estimation of ultra-trace silver fractions in marine waters.,"Ag can be found in the ocean at the ultra-trace level, mainly as AgCl(n)((n-1)-) and complexed by dissolved organic matter (Ag-DOM). However, methods for studying Ag speciation in marine waters are limited by the lack of extractants capable to separate organic and inorganic silver species in natural conditions of seawater samples. In this work, a two-phase solvent bar micro-extraction method using the ionic liquid trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride (Cyphos® 101) was applied for selective micro-extraction of AgCl(n)((n-1)-) from organic silver in marine waters, working at seawater pH,. The application to real samples was performed under the following conditions: 2.5% Cyphos® 101 in kerosene solution with 10% dodecan-1-ol inside the fiber, and 30 min of sample extraction at a stirring rate of 800 rpm. The proposed SBME was successfully used for estimation of Ag fractions in waters from the Bay of Cádiz (South-west Spain) showing its applicability for a simple, fast and environmentally friendly speciation of silver in marine water samples. The method presented a linear response up to 500 ng L(-1) and a detection limit of 0.4 ng L(-1), using GF-AAS for instrumental determination.",Herce-Sesa B; López-López JA; Moreno C,Ionic liquid solvent bar micro-extraction; Seawater; Silver; Speciation,2019,The Science of the total environment,Journal Article,
RPM,30156190,Comparison of the mechanical properties of platelet-rich fibrin and ankaferd blood stopper-loaded platelet-rich fibrin.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) can be named as a natural fibrin-based biomaterial favorable to increasing vascularization and able to guide epithelial cell migration to its surface. The membrane has a significant positive effect on protecting open wounds and accelerating healing. Similar to PRF Ankaferd Blood Stopper (ABS) also has positive effects on wound healing. The aim of this study was to detect if we can improve known physical properties of PRF combining with ABS. This idea was based on the known mechanism of ABS in forming protein network without damaging any blood cells. Materials and Methods: A total of 25 adult rabbits used for collecting 5-7 ml of blood passively with the help of winged blood collection needle to the test tube. Collected samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Two similar samples obtained from each animal and one of the samples was placed in 20% ABS 80% saline solution for 5 min. Mechanical properties of the membrane samples were measured using Universal Testing Machine. Results: There is the statistically significant difference between PRF and ABS added PRF in elongation/mm (dL) and elongation/% at break values. Maximum force (fMax) and modulus values did not show any statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION: ABS loaded PRF causes better physical properties. This combination seems to exhibit superior performance when used as a membrane barrier solely.

RPM,30109111,Zinc recovery from metallurgical slag and dust by coordination leaching in NH(3)-CH(3)COONH(4)-H(2)O system.,"Metallurgical slag and dust (MSD) from lead and zinc smelting, steel dust and galvanized steel scrap are important secondary sources of zinc and other valuable metals. This paper describes the production feasibility and rationality of a cleaner zinc recovery process using MSD and a hydrometallurgical method. It was found that the addition of CH(3)COONH(4) to a NH(3)-H(2)O system promotes zinc extraction, and 83.76% of zinc could be dissolved and recovered from the MSD under the following conditions: total ammonia concentration of 5 mol l(-1), stirring speed of 300 r.p.m., ammonia/ammonium ratio of 1 : 1, solid/liquid ratio of 1 : 5, leaching temperature of 25°C and a leaching time of 60 min. A leaching kinetic study indicates that the leaching process is controlled by the diffusion and interface transfer and that the reaction apparent activation energy is 22.66 kJ mol(-1). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis showed that zinc can combine with the carboxylate anion to form Zn complexes such as [Zn(2)(Ac)(3)(NH(3))(2)](+). Zn(2)SiO(4), ZnS and ZnFe(2)O(4) in NH(3)-CH(3)COONH(4)-H(2)O system did not disappear according to X-ray diffraction analysis for leaching residue.",Ma A; Zheng X; Li S; Wang Y; Zhu S,ammonium acetate; coordination leaching; metallurgical slag and dust; zinc extraction,2018,Royal Society open science,Journal Article,
RPM,29987302,Real-time measurement of the crystal violet adsorption behavior and interaction process at the silica-aqueous interface by near-field evanescent wave.,"The interfacial adsorption and interaction of crystal violet (CV) at the silica-water interface was real-time measured based on a total-internal-reflection-induced near-field evanescent wave (TIR-NFEW). A silica optical fiber (SOF) was employed as a charged substrate for CV adsorption and as a light transmission waveguide for evanescent wave production for the investigation system. According to the change of evanescent wave intensity, the CV adsorption behavior could be real-time monitored at the silica-aqueous interface. The Langmuir adsorption model and two kinetic models were applied to obtain the related thermodynamic and kinetic data, including the adsorption equilibrium constant (Kads) of (5.9 ± 1.5) × 104 M-1 and adsorption free energy (ΔG) of -21.6 ± 0.6 kJ mol-1. Meanwhile, this method was shown to be able to isolate the elementary processes of adsorption and desorption under steady-state conditions, and gave an adsorption rate constant (ka) and desorption rate constant (kd) of 2089 ± 6.96 M min-1 and 0.35 ± 0.0012 min-1 for a 15 rpm flow rate. The surface interaction process was revealed and the adsorption mechanism proposed by a molecular orientation adsorption model with three-stage-concentration, indicating that CV first adsorbed on Si-O- sites through electrostatic attraction, then on Si-OH sites through hydrogen bonding, and lastly on the surface through van der Waals forces with different CV concentrations. This study can provide a molecular-level interpretation of CV adsorption and provides important insights into how CV adsorption can be controlled at the silica-water interface.",Xiong Y; Chen J; Duan M; Fang S,,2018,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,Journal Article,

Selective recovery of Zn in leaching solution including Mn, Cd, Cu ion was difficult due to its similar physicochemical behaviour. Experiment results by present leaching solution with 279 µm undersize indicated that the best condition for leaching is 1 M H(2)SO(4), 250 rpm, 5 vol.% H(2)O(2) and 353 K and the leaching efficient of Zn, Co and Mn is approximately 97%, respectively. The exclusive extraction behaviour of Zn by using D2EHPA is indicated that the best conditions for solvent extraction are to be 0.6 M D2EHPA diluted with kerosene, 30% saponification, 298 K, 5-min contact time and three-stage countercurrent extraction, and the O/A ratio 1, respectively. Recovery of Zn was with approximately 99.7% selectively from Mn, Co, Ni, Cd and Li.

Nine healthy males underwent a within session randomised crossover design where they completed both the leg press and recumbent cycle ergometer conditions. Conditions were approximately matched for effort and duration (leg press: 4 × 12RM using a 2 s concentric and 3 s eccentric repetition duration controlled with a metronome, thus each set lasted  60 s; recumbent cycle ergometer: 4 × 60 s bouts using a resistance level permitting 80-100 rpm but culminating with being unable to sustain the minimum cadence for the final 5-10 s). Measurements included VO(2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), blood lactate, energy expenditure, muscle swelling, and electromyography. Perceived effort was similar between conditions and thus both were well matched with respect to effort. There were no significant effects by 'condition' in any of the physiological responses examined (all p > 0.05). The present study shows that, when both effort and duration are matched, resistance training (leg press) and 'cardio' exercise (recumbent cycle ergometry) may produce largely similar responses in VO(2), RER, blood lactate, energy expenditure, muscle swelling, and electromyography. It therefore seems reasonable to suggest that both may offer a similar stimulus to produce chronic physiological adaptations in outcomes such as cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, and hypertrophy. Future work should look to both replicate the study conducted here with respect to the same, and additional physiological measures, and rigorously test the comparative efficacy of effort and duration matched exercise of differing modalities with respect to chronic improvements in physiological fitness.",Steele J; Butler A; Comerford Z; Dyer J; Lloyd N; Ward J; Fisher J; Gentil P; Scott C; Ozaki H,Electromyography; Energy expenditure; Exercise modality; Lactate; Muscle swelling,2018,PeerJ,Journal Article,
RPM,29487432,Effect of extrusion process on the functional properties of high amylose corn starch edible films and its application in mango (Mangifera indica L.) cv. Tommy Atkins.,"Starch is an attractive raw material as ingredient for edible film manufacture because of its low cost, abundant availability, renewability, and biodegradability. Nevertheless, starch based films exhibit several disadvantages such as brittleness and poor mechanical and barrier properties, which restrict its application for food packaging. The use of the extrusion technology as a pretreatment of the casting technique to change the starch structure in order to obtain edible films, may constitute an alternative to generate coatings with good functional properties and maintain longer the postharvest quality and shelf life of fruits. For this reason, the objective of this study was to optimize the conditions of an extrusion process to obtain a formulation of modified starch to elaborate edible films with good functional properties using the casting technique and assess the effect during the storage when applied on a model fruit. The best conditions of the extrusion process and concentration of plasticizers were obtained using response surface methodology. From optimization study, it was found that appropriate conditions to obtain starch edible films with the best mechanical and barrier properties were an extrusion temperature of 100 °C and a screw speed of 120 rpm, while the glycerol content was 16.73%. Also, once applied in fruit, the loss of quality attributes was diminished.",Calderón-Castro A; Vega-García MO; de Jesús Zazueta-Morales J; Fitch-Vargas PR; Carrillo-López A; Gutiérrez-Dorado R; Limón-Valenzuela V; Aguilar-Palazuelos E,Casting technique; Extrusion temperature; Glycerol content and postharvest quality; Optimization,2018,Journal of food science and technology,Journal Article,
RPM,29460145,A Paper-Based Analytical Device Based on Combination of Thin Film Microextraction and Reflection Scanometry for Sensitive Colorimetric Determination of Ni(II) in Aqueous Matrix.,"In this research, the thin film microextraction method was applied for the extraction of Ni(II) ion from aqueous matrixes. Chemically modified cellulosic filter paper with phosphorus was used as a thin film extractor. After extraction, the thin film was treated with a solution of dimethylglyoxime. The colored film was captured by flatbed scanner and the absorbance of the images was extracted by some suitable software. Under the optimum conditions and at the pH 7.0, with the sample volume of 100 mL, the stirring rate of 800 rpm, and the extraction time of 50 min, the calibration curve was obtained in the range of 0.05-5 mg/L Ni(II) (R(2) = 0.989). Limit and relative standard deviation were achieved to be 18 µg/L and less than 6.7%, respectively. Relative recoveries were obtained in the range of 87%-105%. Finally, the proposed method was found to be simple and cost-effective, with adequate analytical performance for the rapid detection of Ni(II) in river and wastewater samples.",Allafchian AR; Farajmand B; Koupaei AJ,Chemically modified cellulose; Colorimetry; Nickel (II); Reflection; Scanometry; Thin film microextraction,2018,Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology,Journal Article,
RPM,29313537,Relationship between lignocellulosic biomass dissolution and physicochemical properties of ionic liquids composed of 3-methylimidazolium cations and carboxylate anions.,"The ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM]Acetate) has been widely used for biomass processing, i.e., to pretreat, activate, or fractionate lignocellulosic biomass to produce soluble sugars and lignin. However, this IL does not achieve high biomass solubility, therefore minimizing the efficiency of biomass processing. In this study, [EMIM]Acetate and three other ILs composed of different 3-methylimidazolium cations and carboxylate anions ([EMIM]Formate, 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium ([AMIM]) formate, and [AMIM]Acetate) were analyzed to relate their physicochemical properties to their biomass solubility performance. While all four ILs are able to dissolve hybrid poplar under fairly mild process conditions (80 °C and 100 RPM stirring), [AMIM]Formate and [AMIM]Acetate have particularly increased biomass solubility of 40 and 32%, respectively, relative to [EMIM]Acetate. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that strong interactions between IL and specific plant biopolymers may contribute to this enhanced solubilization, as the calculated second virial coefficients between ILs and hemicellullose are most favorable for [AMIM]Formate, matching the trend of the experimental solubility measurements. The simulations also reveal that the interactions between the ILs and hemicellulose are an important factor in determining the overall biomass solubility, whereas lignin-IL interactions were not found to vary significantly, consistent with literature. The combined experimental and simulation studies identify [AMIM]Formate as an efficient biomass solvent and explain its efficacy, suggesting a new approach to rationally select ionic liquid solvents for lignocellulosic deconstruction.",Moyer P; Smith MD; Abdoulmoumine N; Chmely SC; Smith JC; Petridis L; Labbé N,,2018,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,Journal Article,
RPM,29290060,"Effect of injection pressure on performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of diesel-acetylene-fuelled single cylinder stationary CI engine.","In this paper, the effect of injection pressure on the performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of a diesel-acetylene fuelled single cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection (DI) diesel engine with a rated power of 3.5 kW at a rated speed of 1500 rpm was studied. Experiments were performed in dual-fuel mode at four different injection pressures of 180, 190, 200, and 210 bar with a flow rate of 120 LPH of acetylene and results were compared with that of baseline diesel operation. Experimental results showed that highest brake thermal efficiency of 27.57% was achieved at injection pressure of 200 bar for diesel-acetylene dual-fuel mode which was much higher than 23.32% obtained for baseline diesel. Carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and smoke emissions were also measured and found to be lower, while the NO (x) emissions were higher at 200 bar in dual fuel mode as compared to those in other injection pressures in dual fuel mode and also for baseline diesel mode. Peak cylinder pressure, net heat release rate, and rate of pressure rise were also calculated and were higher at 200 bar injection pressure in dual fuel mode.",Srivastava AK; Soni SL; Sharma D; Jain NL,Acetylene; Diesel engine; Dual fuel; Injection pressure,2018,Environmental science and pollution research international,Journal Article,
RPM,29071105,Cognitive effects of a 30-min aerobic exercise bout on adults with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes.,"BACKGROUND: Several studies document reliable brain health benefits of acute exercise bouts. However, no prior studies have explored such effects among those living with co-morbid overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), both of which are conditions associated with cognitive performance decrements. PURPOSE: To examine the impact of a 30-min bout of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on executive function among adults with overweight/obesity and T2DM, employing a widely used experimental paradigm. METHODS: Thirty adults with overweight/obesity and T2DM were randomly assigned to moderate (30% maximal heart rate reserve) and minimal (r.p.m. 30-50; work load 5) intensity aerobic exercise. Pre-exercise to post-exercise changes in Stroop interference and Go/No-Go scores were compared across conditions. RESULTS: Primary analyses revealed no overall effect of exercise condition on changes in Stroop or Go/No-Go performance. Post-hoc moderation analyses indicated that Stroop interference scores were reduced, following moderate exercise among female participants and among those who were more physically active. CONCLUSION: The current study revealed no reliable benefit of acute aerobic exercise for overweight and obese individuals living with T2DM overall. There may be limited benefits for women and more and active subgroups, but the precise nature of such benefits remains unclear.",Vincent CM; Hall PA,Aerobic exercise; executive function; self‐regulatory fatigue; type 2 diabetes,2017,Obesity science & practice,Journal Article,
RPM,28831283,"In Vitro Dissolution Profile of Dapagliflozin: Development, Method Validation, and Analysis of Commercial Tablets.","Dapagliflozin was the first of its class (inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporter) to be approved in Europe, USA, and Brazil. As the drug was recently approved, there is the need for research on analytical methods, including dissolution studies for the quality evaluation and assurance of tablets. The dissolution methodology was developed with apparatus II (paddle) in 900 mL of medium (simulated gastric fluid, pH 1.2), temperature set at 37 ± 0.5°C, and stirring speed of 50 rpm. For the quantification, a spectrophotometric (λ = 224 nm) method was developed and validated. In validation studies, the method proved to be specific and linear in the range from 0.5 to 15 μg·mL(-1) (r(2) = 0.998). The precision showed results with RSD values lower than 2%. The recovery of 80.72, 98.47, and 119.41% proved the accuracy of the method. Through a systematic approach by applying Factorial 2(3), the robustness of the method was confirmed (p > 0.05). The studies of commercial tablets containing 5 or 10 mg demonstrated that they could be considered similar through f1, f2, and dissolution efficiency analyses. Also, the developed method can be used for the quality evaluation of dapagliflozin tablets and can be considered as a scientific basis for future official pharmacopoeial methods.",de Meira RZC; Maciel AB; Murakami FS; de Oliveira PR; Bernardi LS,,2017,International journal of analytical chemistry,Journal Article,
RPM,28794310,Structured Mono- and Diacylglycerols with a High Content of Medium Chain Fatty Acids.,"In the present work, direct enzyme-catalysed esterification of medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) from three different sources (Medium chain triacylglycerols, MCT; saponified MCT and a mixture of free MCFA) was evaluated to obtain structured mono- and diacylglycerols. The esterifications were carried out mixing the different sources of MCFA with glycerol at two weight ratios (1:1 and 4:1, w/w), using three immobilized lipases: Novozym 435, Lipozyme RM IM and Lipozyme TL IM; different reaction times (t = 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 min); enzyme loadings (5, 10 or 15% with respect to the total weight of substrates). The extent of esterification was determined by gas chromatography (GC) analysis of the acylglycerols produced. The highest incorporation of free MCFA into glycerol was obtained for a 1:1 (w/w) glycerol to free MCFA ratio, 5% of Novozym 435, at 50°C, 300 rpm, 10% of molecular sieves and a commercial MCFA mixture as starting material. Under these conditions, incorporation of at least 90% of MCFA into glycerol was achieved after 30 min of reaction.",Esperón-Rojas AA; Baeza-Jiménez R; Cano-Sarmiento C; García HS,diacylglycerols; glycerolysis; medium chain fatty acids; monoacylglycerols,2017,Journal of oleo science,Journal Article,
RPM,28680373,Cadmium Removal from Contaminated Water Using Polyelectrolyte-Coated Industrial Waste Fly Ash.,"Fly ash (FA) is a major industrial waste generated from power stations that add extra cost for proper disposal. Recent research efforts have consequently focused on developing ways to make use of FA in environmentally sound applications. This study, therefore, investigates the potential ability of raw fly ash (RFA) and polyelectrolyte-coated fly ash (PEFA) to remove cadmium (Cd) from polluted water. Using layer-by-layer approach, functionalized fly ash was coated with 20 layers from 0.03% (v/v) of cationic poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) and anionic polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) solutions. Both surface morphology and chemical composition of the adsorbent (PEFA) were characterized using Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR), and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) techniques. The effects of pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, initial contaminant concentration, and mixing rate of the adsorption of Cd were also studied in batch mode experiments. Results of the study revealed that a 4.0 g/L dosage of PEFA removed around 99% of 2.0 mg/L of Cd in 15 min at 150 rpm compared to only 27% Cd removal achieved by RFA under the same conditions. Results also showed that adsorption by PEFA followed both Langmuir and Freundlich models with correlation coefficients of 98% and 99%, respectively.",Olabemiwo FA; Tawabini BS; Patel F; Oyehan TA; Khaled M; Laoui T,,2017,Bioinorganic chemistry and applications,Journal Article,
RPM,28477144,Kinetics of Enzymatic Synthesis of Cinnamyl Butyrate by Immobilized Lipase.,"This work illustrates the enzymatic synthesis of cinnamyl butyrate by esterification of butyric acid and cinnamyl alcohol. Experiments were performed to study the various operating parameters such as molar ratio, enzyme concentration, temperature, and speed of agitation. Also, the suitable kinetic model for esterification reaction was predicted and the various kinetic parameters were determined. It has been observed that the experimental results agree well with the simulated results obtained by following the ping-pong bi-bi mechanism with dead-end inhibition by both the substrate acid and alcohol. The highest 90% conversion of butyric acid was observed after 12 h at the following reaction conditions: substrate molar ratio 1:2 (butyric acid/cinnamyl alcohol), temperature 50 °C, enzyme loading 2% (with respect to the weight of the substrates), and agitation speed 250 rpm. Diffusional mass transfer limitations between substrate and enzyme surface do not show significant effect on reaction kinetics.

RPM,28058133,Quantification of Warfarin in Dried Rat Plasma Spots by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry.,"This paper presents the development and validation of a novel method for quantification of the oral anticoagulant drug warfarin in dried plasma spots (DPS) by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Blood plasma was chosen as a biological fluid to preclude the influence of the hematocrit on the results of the analysis. A 30 μL sample of rat plasma was placed onto Whatman 903 Protein Saver Card and was allowed to dry. A single DPS is sufficient for preparing eight 3.2 mm discs, each containing approximately 1.5-1.6 μL of plasma. Warfarin extraction from one 3.2 mm disc was carried out by adding 200 μL of the acetonitrile : water mixture (1 : 1, v/v) containing 10 mM NH(4)COOH (pH 4.0), with incubation on a shaker at 1000 rpm for 1 h at 25°C. After chromatographic separation, warfarin and coumachlor (an internal standard) were measured using negative-ion multiple-reaction monitoring with ion transitions m/z 307 → 161 for warfarin and m/z 341 → 161 for the internal standard. The working range of this method is 10-10,000 ng/mL. Within this range, intra- and interday variability of precision and accuracy was <13% and recovery was 82-99%. The results indicate that the new method requires only small plasma samples and may be useful for pharmacokinetic research on warfarin.",Chernonosov A,,2016,Journal of pharmaceutics,Journal Article,
